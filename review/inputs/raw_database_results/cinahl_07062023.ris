AB  - There is a global recognition that the homeless in different clusters are isolated social groups. They are highly susceptible to loneliness and related psycho‐physical health outcomes owing to their less supportive and fragmented social networks. The conditions are worse in the case of chronic or lifetime homelessness. Beyond this popular notion, other critical perspectives are also there. This paper attempts to analyse the differences in inter‐personal social networks between the chronic and the non‐chronic homeless groups at a railway junction in India. The data have been collected through structured and semi‐structured questionnaires from 28 homeless people (15 chronically and 13 non‐chronically homeless) of Burdwan Railway Junction – a vital railway junction of West Bengal, India. The chronically homeless group displays more supportive and compact inter‐personal networks in this study than the non‐chronic homeless group. Living in the station area for a long time, they have formed a society of their own. Barring some psychological stress and social abuse, the livelihood scenario of these people is relatively stress‐free and social networks relations are more intensive and supportive. Considering the outcomes, instead of the housing‐first approach of rehabilitation, we favour the development of community shelters with minimum basic amenities close to their present location.

AB  - HIV researchers use short messaging service (SMS)-based surveys to monitor health behaviors more closely than what would be possible with in-person assessment. Benefits are tempered by nonresponse to completing surveys. Understanding response patterns and their associated study participant characteristics would guide more tailored use of SMS-based surveys for HIV studies. We examined response to weekly 7-item SMS surveys administered as part of an HIV prevention trial. Using Mixture hidden Markov models (MHMM), we identified the underlying response patterns shared by subgroups of participants over time and quantified the association between these response patterns and participant characteristics. Three underlying response patterns were identified; responders, responders with phone-related errors, and non-responders. Non-responders versus responders were more likely to be younger, male, cis-gender, Black and Latinx participants with histories of homelessness, incarceration, and social support service utilization. Responders with phone-related errors compared to non-responders were more likely to be Black, Latinx, female, students, and have a history of incarceration and social support service utilization. More nuanced results from MHMM analyses better inform what strategies to use for increasing SMS response rates, including assisting in securing phone ownership/service for responders with phone-related errors and identifying alternative strategies for non-responders. Actively collecting and monitoring non-delivery notification data available from SMS gateway service companies offers another opportunity to identify and connect with participants when they are willing but unable to respond during follow-up.

AB  - Homeless youth experience high rates of suicidal ideation and attempts, yet limited research has examined predictors of treatment engagement among this population. Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) between the ages of 18 and 24 years were recruited from a drop-in center in Columbus, Ohio. Participants were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention + treatment as usual through a local drop-in center (CTSP + TAU) (N = 75) or TAU alone (N = 75), and treatment attendance among those assigned to CTSP + TAU was examined in this study. As expected, among youth engaged in CTSP + TAU, those with a history of intimate partner violence (IPV) showed decreased odds of treatment attendance. Additionally, youth randomized into CTSP + TAU with higher acquired capability for suicide (ACS) scores and those identifying as Black were more likely to attend treatment sessions. Findings suggest that effective treatment implementation must consider youth's trauma history, demographics and severity of suicidal ideation and behaviors.

AB  - Two of the most commonly used psychosis screening measures are the Prodromal Questionnaire–Brief (PQ-B) and the Youth Psychosis at Risk Questionnaire–Brief (YPARQ-B). Both scales have considerable support for the reliability and validity of their scores for use with English- and Spanish-speaking participants, with measurement equivalence established across a subset of demographic characteristics. However, measurement invariance has not been examined across several important demographic variables, including native language, language of the scales used with Hispanic participants, education, occupation, income, birth country, and generation status. In the present study, (N = 1,191) measurement invariance was examined for each of these variables across three samples (ns = 505, 714, and 126). The PQ-B total scores and YPARQ-B were found to demonstrate configural and scalar invariance, while PQ-B Distress scores displayed configural, metric, and scalar invariance across most tested demographic variables. Psychosis scores were associated with social determinants of health (SDoH) including major and everyday experiences of discrimination, food insecurity, financial insecurity, acculturation, and ethnic identity. The associations between psychosis and SDoH were mostly consistent across groups. Compared to White-non-Hispanic participants, Hispanic participants had higher scores on all psychosis measures and tended to have higher scores on discrimination, food and housing insecurity, affirmation aspects of ethnic identity, and acculturative stress. Despite differences in psychosis levels, the groups did not differ in history of treatment. Overall, these results provide strong evidence that the PQ-B and YPARQ provide equivalent, nonbiased, valid, and reliable scores in Hispanic and Non-Hispanic participants in both English and Spanish. Public Significance Statement: Two commonly used psychosis measures displayed measurement invariance across a range of demographic variables including language, race, ethnicity, gender, age, and education. These scales can be used in both English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanic populations to screen for psychosis and yield equivalent scores.

AB  - Background: At‐risk youth may be defined as a diverse group of young people in unstable life circumstances, who are currently experiencing or are at risk of developing one or more serious problems. At‐risk youth are often very unlikely to seek out help for themselves within the established venues, as their adverse developmental trajectories have installed a lack of trust in authorities such as child protection agencies and social workers. To help this population, a number of outreach programmes have been established seeking to help the young people on an ad hoc basis, meaning that the interventions are designed to fit the individual needs of each young person rather than as a one‐size‐fits‐all treatment model. The intervention in this review is targeted outreach work which may be (but does not have to be) multicomponent programmes in which outreach may be combined with other services. Objectives: The main objective of this review was to answer the following research questions: What are the effects of outreach programmes on problem/high‐risk behaviour of young people between 8 and 25 years of age living in OECD countries? Are they less likely to experience an adverse outcome such as school failure or drop‐out, runaway and homelessness, substance and/or alcohol abuse, unemployment, long‐term poverty, delinquency and more serious criminal behaviour? Search Methods: We identified relevant studies through electronic searches of bibliographic databases, governmental and grey literature repositories, hand search in specific targeted journals, citation tracking, and Internet search engines. The database searches were carried out in September 2020 and other resources were searched in October and November 2021. We searched to identify both published and unpublished literature, and reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews were searched. Selection Criteria: The intervention was targeted outreach work which may have been combined with other services. Young people between 8 and 25 years of age living in OECD countries, who either have experienced or is at‐risk of experiencing an adverse outcome were eligible. Our primary focus was on measures of problem/high‐risk behaviour and a secondary focus was on social and emotional outcomes. All study designs that used a well‐defined control group were eligible for inclusion. Studies that utilised qualitative approaches were not included. Data Collection and Analysis: The total number of potentially relevant studies constituted 17,659 hits. A total of 16 studies (17 different interventions) met the inclusion criteria. Only five studies could be used in the data synthesis. Eight studies could not be used in the data synthesis as they were judged to have critical risk of bias and, in accordance with the protocol, were excluded from the meta‐analysis on the basis that they would be more likely to mislead than inform. Two studies (three interventions) did not provide enough information enabling us to calculate an effect size and standard error, and one study did not provide enough information to assess risk of bias. Meta‐analysis of all outcomes were conducted on each conceptual outcome separately. All analyses were inverse variance weighted using random effects statistical models incorporating both the sampling variance and between study variance components into the study level weights. Random effects weighted mean effect sizes were calculated using 95% confidence intervals. Too few studies were included to carry out any sensitivity analyses. Main Results: Four of the five studies used for meta analysis were from the USA and one was from Canada. The timespan in which included studies were carried out was 32 years, from 1985 to 2017; on average the intervention year was 2005. The average number of participants in the analysed interventions was 116, ranging from 30 to 346 and the average number of controls was 81, ranging from 32 to 321. At most, the results from two studies could be pooled in a single meta‐analysis. It was only possible to pool the outcomes drug (other than marijuana) use, marijuana use and alcohol use each at two different time points (one and 3 months follow up). At 1 month follow up the weighted averages varied between zero and 0.05 and at 3 months follow up between −0.17 and 0.07. None of them were statistically significant. In addition, a number of other outcomes were reported in a single study only. Authors' Conclusions: Overall, there were too few studies included in any of the meta‐analyses in order for us to draw any conclusion concerning the effectiveness of outreach. The vast majority of studies were undertaken in the USA. The dominance of the USA as the main country in which outreach interventions meeting our inclusion criteria have been evaluated using rigorous methods and within our specific parameters clearly limits the generalisability of the findings. None of the studies, however, was considered to be of overall high quality in our risk of bias assessment and the process of excluding studies with critical risk of bias from the meta‐analysis applied in this review left us with only five of a total of 16 possible studies to synthesise. Further, because too few studies reported results on the same type of outcome at most two studies could be combined in a particular meta‐analysis. Given the limited number of rigorous studies available from countries other than the USA, it would be natural to consider conducting a series of randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of outreach for at‐risk youth in countries outside the USA. The trial(s) should be designed, conducted and reported according to methodological criteria for rigour in respect of internal and external validity to achieve robust results and preferably reporting a larger number of outcomes.

AB  - Economic vulnerability, such as homelessness and unemployment, contributes to HIV risk among U.S. racial minorities. Yet, few economic-strengthening interventions have been adapted for HIV prevention in this population. This study assessed the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial of a 20-week microenterprise intervention for economically-vulnerable African-American young adults. Engaging MicroenterprisE for Resource Generation and Health Empowerment (EMERGE) aimed to reduce sexual risk behaviors and increase employment and uptake of HIV preventive behaviors. The experimental group received text messages on job openings plus educational sessions, mentoring, a start-up grant, and business and HIV prevention text messages. The comparison group received text messages on job openings only. Primary feasibility objectives assessed recruitment, randomization, participation, and retention. Secondary objectives examined employment, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV preventive behaviors. Outcome assessments used an in-person pre- and post-intervention interview and a weekly text message survey. Several progression criteria for a definitive trial were met. Thirty-eight participants were randomized to experimental (n = 19) or comparison group (n = 19) of which 95% were retained. The comparison intervention enhanced willingness to be randomized and reduced non-participation. Mean age of participants was 21.0 years; 35% were male; 81% were unemployed. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of experimental participants completed ≥ 70% of intervention activities, and 74% completed ≥ 50% of intervention activities. Participation in intervention activities and outcome assessments was highest in the first half (~ 10 weeks) of the study. Seventy-one percent (71%) of weekly text message surveys received a response through week 14, but responsiveness declined to 37% of participants responding to ≥ 70% of weekly text message surveys at the end of the study. The experimental group reported higher employment (from 32% at baseline to 83% at week 26) and lower unprotected sex (79% to 58%) over time compared to reported changes in employment (37% to 47%) and unprotected sex (63% to 53%) over time in the comparison group. Conducting this feasibility trial was a critical step in the process of designing and testing a behavioral intervention. Development of a fully-powered effectiveness trial should take into account lessons learned regarding intervention duration, screening, and measurement. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - Emergency shelters are a core component of homeless service systems that address immediate basic needs. Service bans, which refer to temporary or permanent disallowances from a program or organization, are an underresearched phenomenon that can leave people experiencing homelessness without needed supports. This exploratory study examined the factors associated with shelter bans among people experiencing homelessness using secondary data from two Canadian studies: (1) a multisite randomized controlled trial of Housing First (At Home/Chez Soi Demonstration Project) and (2) a cross-sectional survey of youth experiencing homelessness across Canada (2019 Without a Home-National Youth Homelessness Survey). The two datasets were analyzed separately using logistic regression models with similar predictors to maximize the comparability of the results. Participants who experienced homelessness at an earlier age and had recent criminal justice system involvement were more likely to have shelter bans in both datasets. Impaired impulse control, more chronic medical conditions and living in Toronto were associated with increased likelihood of shelter bans in the At Home/Chez Soi dataset, whereas more adverse childhood experiences, physical violence victimization, engagement in survival sex behaviours and longer current episodes of homelessness were significant predictors of bans in the Without A Home dataset. Overall, the findings suggest that victimization and criminalization during homelessness may increase the risk of shelter loss from bans and further exclusion. The observed regional differences also highlight the potential limits of individual-level predictors. Further research is needed on shelter ban outcomes, as well as how capacity limits and organizational policies affect banning decisions.

AB  - Background: Research exploring associations between exposure to social determinants of health and breastfeeding is needed to identify breastfeeding barriers. Housing insecurity and household conditions (chaos and crowding) may affect breastfeeding by increasing maternal stress and discomfort and decreasing time available to breastfeed. Research Aim: We aimed to examine the relationships between housing insecurity, breastfeeding exclusivity intention during the early postnatal period, and breastfeeding exclusivity at 6 months postpartum among a sample "at risk" for suboptimal breastfeeding rates. Methods: This study is a secondary data analysis of a longitudinal study at two time periods. Data were collected from English- and Spanish-speaking, Medicaid-eligible mother-infant dyads (N = 361) at near-birth and child aged 6 months, in New York City and Pittsburgh. Structural equation modeling was used to examine direct and indirect effects of housing insecurity on breastfeeding exclusivity at child aged 6 months. Results: The path model showed that experiencing more markers of housing insecurity (i.e., foreclosure/eviction threat, history of homelessness, late rent) was predictive of significantly lower breastfeeding exclusivity at 6 months. This was partially mediated through less exclusive breastfeeding intention during the early postnatal period. Greater household crowding was associated with 6-month breastfeeding exclusivity when mediated by intention. Household crowding had differential effects by study site and participant race/ethnicity. Conclusion: Refinement of housing insecurity as a multi-dimensional construct can lead to the development of standardized data collection instruments, inform future methodological decisions in research addressing social determinants of health, and can inform the development of responsive individual- and structural-level interventions. The data used in this study were collected as part of the SMART Beginnings Randomized Controlled Trial (NCT02459327 registered at ClinicalTrials.gov).

AB  - Adolescents in low‐income, marginalized families are vulnerable to behavior problems that impede healthy functioning and threaten long‐term well‐being. Informal supports may fill an important gap for these households as they navigate financial and social stressors. Instrumental support from social networks and neighborhood cohesion may promote family stability and youth well‐being; further, these informal supports may promote resilience to housing insecurity, which is linked with a range of adverse adolescent outcomes. The present study utilized data from a large sample of at‐risk families with children (N = 2425) to investigate whether instrumental support and neighborhood cohesion predicted adolescent behavior problems over 10 years and whether these links were mediated by housing insecurity. Results of structural equation modeling with latent variables showed direct links from instrumental support to anxious/depressed behaviors and from neighborhood cohesion to aggressive behaviors, as well as an indirect link from instrumental support to aggressive behavior via housing insecurity. Findings suggest informal supports are an important source of resilience for low‐income families who may be excluded from or are reluctant to engage with formal social systems. Further, stable, connected communities with highly embedded social networks can promote housing stability and youth well‐being in a virtuous cycle. Highlights: Instrumental support in childhood protects against anxious and depressive behaviors in adolescence. Neighborhood cohesion in childhood protects against aggressive behaviors in adolescence. Instrumental support protects against housing insecurity. Housing insecurity mediates the link from instrumental support to adolescent aggression. Informal supports are an important source of resilience for low‐income, marginalized families.

AB  - We examined racial/ethnic inequities in the prevalence of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and examined the association between ACEs and selected health-related behaviors and problems. Data for this cross-sectional study come from the 2018 Maryland Youth Risk Behavior Survey/Youth Tobacco Survey, a statewide survey of high school students (n = 40,188). ACEs included caregiver verbal abuse and household food insecurity, substance use or gambling, mental illness, and involvement with the criminal justice system. We estimated the prevalence of ACEs overall and by race/ethnicity, and then used multiple logistic regression to determine associations between ACEs and emotional/behavioral problems, adjusting for race/ethnicity. Outcome variables included emotional distress, poor school performance, suicidal ideation, fighting, alcohol use, and marijuana use. More than one fifth of students reported each individual ACE. Differences in the prevalence of ACEs by race/ethnicity were statistically significant (p <.001). More than one fourth (25.8%) reported one of the five ACEs, 15.1% reported two, and 15.4% reported three or more. For each ACE, reporting having experienced it (vs. not) was associated with a >30% higher prevalence for each of the outcome variables. Among students who reported three or more ACEs (relative to none), the odds of emotional distress and suicidal ideation were more than 8 times greater. Among Maryland adolescents, ACEs are common, are inequitably distributed by race/ethnicity, and are strongly linked to behavioral health. Findings suggest the need to monitor ACEs as a routine component of adolescent health surveillance and to refocus assessment and intervention toward "upstream" factors that shape adolescent health.

AB  - As issues related to transgender and gender diverse individuals gain more national media attention, professional organizations that promote mental health and LGBTQ + rights continue to advocate for equality and inclusion. Barriers to equality and inclusion for transgender and gender diverse individuals can include a variety of factors including discrimination in educational and workplace settings, and issues related to housing, poverty, and homelessness. To examine the impact of a media intervention on changing attitudes toward transgender and gender diverse individuals. A total of 223 students from a large, Midwestern university in the USA participated and received a 45-minute media intervention along with pre- and post-testing. A split-plot factorial ANOVA to investigate potential differences in attitudes and beliefs toward transgender and gender diverse individuals using the Transgender Attitude and Beliefs Scale indicated a statistically significant interaction based on a media intervention where F(1, 109) = 7.042, p =.009. A split-plot factorial ANOVA to investigate potential differences in willingness to engage in social action on behalf of this population measured by the Social Justice Scale did not indicate a statistically significant interaction based on the media intervention where F(1, 109) =.881, p =.350. These findings suggest that a variety of potential media interventions can increase positive attitudes and beliefs toward marginalized groups, but a stronger and/or additional intervention is needed for participants to engage in social action on behalf of the group. Implications and limitations of the study are discussed.

AB  - Illicit drug use and cognitive distortions confer significant risks to youth suicidal thoughts and behaviors. However, there has been limited evidence regarding the efficacy of suicide prevention interventions with homeless youth, especially studies testing whether such interventions can reduce the risk for suicidal ideation associated with illicit drug use. Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) between the ages of 18 to 24 years were recruited from a drop-in center. Youth were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Youth reported their illicit drug use, cognitive distortions, and suicidal ideation 4 times over 9 months. A multiple-group multilevel structural equation model showed that higher illicit drug use at baseline predicted a slower reduction in cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation in the TAU group. These associations were not found in the CTSP + TAU group, suggesting an interruption of such risk from illicit drug use. Findings suggest that CTSP can reduce the risk of illicit drug use as a treatment barrier towards cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation among homeless youth, with implications to improve treatment efforts and to reduce premature mortality in a vulnerable population.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a brief intervention to promote responsible substance use and safe sex behaviors in youths experiencing homelessness (YEH). Design : A Solomon four-group (double randomized controlled trial) longitudinal design with repeated measures (3- and 6-month follow-ups) was used in drop-in centers for YEH in Austin, Texas and Columbus, Ohio from which 602 youths, 18-24 years-old (M = 21 ± 1.8), 50% white; 69.9% heterosexual were recruited. A manualized one-on-one intervention consisted of six modules delivered via laptop computers. Modules focused on communication, goal-setting, substance use refusal, safe sex behaviors, enhanced psychological capital (hope, optimism, resilience, self-efficacy, gratitude), and life satisfaction. Valid and reliable measures of hope, optimism, future time perspective, resilience, social connectedness, gratitude, condom intention, self-efficacy for safe sex, safe sex behaviors, self-efficacy for substance use refusal, and life satisfaction were used to collect data for which three hypotheses were tested, using intent to treat, with multi-level modeling (R). The analysis showed partial support for all hypotheses: (1) post-test outcomes were greater than pretests; (2) intervention group outcomes were greater than control group measures; and (3) significant effects for pretesting. YEH in Ohio completed significantly more sessions than YEH in Texas (p =.001), but took significantly longer to complete all six sessions (p =.001). This brief intervention had significant effects on YEH to promote healthy attitudes and behaviors that merit further testing in larger samples.

AB  - Objectives: The experience of homelessness for young people can affect social, emotional, and physical development, resulting in poorer physical and mental health outcomes. To reduce rates of youth homelessness, a better understanding of both risk and resilience is needed to inform future intervention development. This article presents a systematic review of published research reporting risk or resilience factors related to homelessness among young people in Western countries.Methods: After thorough examination for inclusion criteria, 665 abstracts of peer-reviewed quantitative studies of risk or resilience factors for homelessness among young people (ages 0-25) that included an adequate comparison group (e.g., not homeless) were selected. After abstract and full-text screening, 16 articles were reviewed. A primary prevention framework was used to create an explanatory model for the onset of homelessness using risk and resilience factors.Results: Common risk factors for youth homelessness included difficulties with family, mental health or substance use problems, a history of problem behaviors, a history of foster care, homelessness as a child, and running away. Common protective factors included a supportive family, a college education, and high socioeconomic status. Findings were integrated into a provisional developmental model of youth homelessness risk. Clinical implications of the model for service development are discussed, and a model for monitoring homelessness risk and resilience factors is proposed.Conclusions: Factors affecting homelessness risk among youths and adults differ, with family, foster care, and schooling playing a much more important role among youths. Findings highlight opportunities for youth homelessness prevention strategies and monitoring.

AB  - Behavioural problems are a recurring issue in the child welfare system population. Normative residential centres do not have the characteristics to address the specific needs of these adolescents, so they are usually treated at therapeutic residential centres. In Catalonia (Spain), these cases are treated in intensive educational residential centres (CREIs), a variant of therapeutic residential care (TRC) facilities. This exploratory study seeks to understand the treatment progress of adolescents with severe behavioural problems who were placed in the CREIs, a variant of TRC facilities. Data from 206 cases, the totality of population under treatment in the CREIs, were collected using a questionnaire administered to the treating team. A cross‐sectional design was used, applying quantitative methods to analyse the incidence and interrelation of a series of variables related to the progress of adolescents in the CREIs. Significant differences among profiles by sex, place of origin, criminal offences, substance abuse and mental health disorders were found. Furthermore, adolescents who performed a positive treatment progress according to the professional staff arrived at the CREI at an earlier age and had longer stays than the group with an unremarkable progress. Logistic regression indicated that duration of stay in the centre and runaways predict the adolescents' treatment progress. This treatment is working well with the milder cases; however, it does not tend to be successful for adolescents with greater difficulties. It is recommended that interventions focus on factors that engage the adolescents in their own rehabilitation process, include substance abuse programmes and consider the gender perspective.

AB  - Introduction: Smoking rates are alarmingly high among young people experiencing homelessness (YEH), yet there are no evidence-based cessation programs for this population. This paper presents results from a pilot evaluation of a text messaging-based smoking cessation treatment, as an adjunct to brief group cessation counseling, to improve abstinence rates among 18-25-year-old smokers experiencing homelessness. The goal of this study was to estimate effect sizes for a larger trial and it was not powered to detect group differences.Aims and Methods: YEH smokers who had a working cell phone with them at recruitment were randomized to receive a group counseling session, nicotine patches, and written material on quitting (n = 37) or a similar program that also included a 6-week automated text messaging intervention (TMI) to provide ongoing support for quitting (n = 40). Smoking outcomes were evaluated through a 90-day follow-up.Results: Seven-day point prevalence abstinence at 90-day follow-up was higher in the TMI condition than standard condition (17.50% vs. 8.11%, respectively; Cohen's h = .37); however, the 90-day continuous abstinence rate was not statistically different from zero in either condition. Reductions in the number of days smoked in the past 30 days from baseline to follow-up were greater in the TMI condition than the standard condition (-14.24 vs. -8.62, respectively; Cohen's d = .49).Conclusions: Adding a 6-week TMI support to a brief group counseling and pharmacotherapy protocol holds promise for smoking reduction and abstinence among YEH smokers. Results indicate that further development and evaluation of the TMI in this population is warranted.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03874585. Registered March 14, 2019, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03874585.Implications: This is the first study to evaluate the feasibility of using a text messaging-based intervention (TMI) for behavior change with 18-25 year olds experiencing homelessness, and more specifically, the first to test a TMI to provide ongoing support for smoking cessation. Small to medium effect sizes for the TMI are promising in terms of implementing a TMI using participants' own cell phones, as well as the efficacy of this approach as an adjunct to standard care (brief group counseling and pharmacotherapy) for smoking cessation among YEH.

AB  - Introduction: Approximately 70% of youth experiencing homelessness smoke cigarettes; many try to quit and are interested in formal smoking cessation programs. The purpose of this study was to describe the intrapersonal, social, and environmental contexts associated with the most recent smoking experience among youth experiencing homelessness and (2) identify differences in contextual factors by age and willingness to quit.Methods: Thirty-six youth experiencing homelessness aged 14-24 years and who reported current smoking were recruited from a drop-in center in a Midwestern city. Semi-structured in-person interviews were analyzed to understand smoking behaviors.Results: Two-thirds of participants reported stress and nicotine dependence as primary reasons for smoking, and older youth (aged 18-24 years) reported smoking to de-escalate negative emotions associated with stressful events. For 25% of participants, and especially older youth, smoking was described as part of a routine. Over 80% of participants smoked outside at the homeless drop-in center or the places they lived. Social prompts from drop-in center peers regularly preempted smoking. Younger youth (aged 14-17 years) reported smoking socially while older youth were more likely to smoke alone.Conclusions: For youth experiencing homelessness, smoking is integrated into daily life and is often used to manage stress associated with homelessness and engage socially with homeless peers. Multicomponent interventions to reduce structural stressors specific to homelessness, change social smoking norms (environmental and social context), and address stress management and nicotine dependence (intrapersonal context) are needed to support smoking cessation among youth experiencing homelessness.Implications: Youth experiencing homelessness overwhelmingly described how daily stressors associated with homelessness and nicotine dependence preceded recent smoking. Older youth (aged 18-24 years) also reported smoking as "routine", which likely underscores nicotine dependence in this group. Younger youth (aged 14-17 years) described social smoking. Researchers must develop optimized multilevel interventions to support youth experiencing homelessness who want to quit smoking. Interventions directly targeting social determinants of stress (e.g., poverty, housing instability, food insecurity) and linkages to supportive services are needed. Complementary strategies to address stress coping and nicotine dependence (intrapersonal context) and social smoking norms (social and environmental context) are also necessitated.

AB  - Importance. Nonsanctioned occupations are those deemed socially unacceptable, unhealthy, or illegal, yet they hold meaning for individuals. A gap in occupational therapy evaluation and intervention to address a broader perspective on occupations prompted the adaptation of the Activity Card Sort tool to explore participation in nonsanctioned occupations. Methods. Develop a new version of the Activity Card Sort-Advancing Inclusive Participation to include occupations experienced by the homeless population, including nonsanctioned occupations. This study occurred in two phases: (1) tool development (item selection, content expert review, line development drawing, and assessment of content validity) and (2) tool use to determine face validity. Participants were selected through a convenience sample at a local homeless shelter and academic institution. Participants experiencing homelessness (phase 1: N = 13 , phase 2: N = 10) were required to be seeking services at the homeless shelter, while nonhomeless participants (phase 2: N = 30) worked full-time, resided with a significant other, and had personal transportation. Results. An assessment of 76 occupations, corresponding line drawings, and follow-up questions was created. An initial construct validity study demonstrated differences between occupational participation of those who are homeless and nonhomeless in the areas of social engagement, nonsanctioned occupations, work and education, and home management. Both groups reported previous, current, or desired engagement in the occupations identified in the assessment. Conclusions and relevance. The purpose of this study was to create an inclusive assessment for use in the homeless population and complete a construct validity study of the assessment tool. Although the results indicated some differences in the frequency with which occupations were performed, the results demonstrated that all individuals participate in occupations that many not contribute to their health and wellness. This initial work supports the future development of a tool that is inclusive of all occupations to obtain a holistic picture of an individual's participation.

AB  - Background: Social disadvantage is associated with children's risk of being overweight or obese, but little is known about how it impacts weight trajectory. This longitudinal analysis examines food insecurity and weight change over time among low-income children in a multidisciplinary weight management clinic. Methods: Food insecurity was assessed between 2008 and 2016 among 794 low-income patients (household income <$60k/year) who attended 3234 visits. Mixed-effects growth curve modeling was used to examine the association between baseline food security status and weight trajectory, using percentage of the 95th percentile for BMI (%BMIp95). Random effects (each child's growth curve) and fixed effects (food insecurity, starting age and %BMIp95, demographics, and months since the initial visit) were modeled, and interactions between food insecurity and elapsed time estimated the influence of food insecurity on weight trajectory. Results: Mean %BMIp95 was 129% (SD 24%), corresponding to severe obesity. Thirty percent of patients were food-insecure at baseline. After adjusting for other factors, monthly change in %BMIp95 was significantly smaller for food-insecure children compared to food-secure peers (difference in the coefficients for slope: 0.13, SE 0.05, p = 0.009). The modeled 12-month change in %BMIp95 was significant for food-secure children (−2.28, SE 0.76, p = 0.0026), but not for food-insecure children (−1.54, SE 1.22, p = 0.21). Conclusion: Household food insecurity was associated with a less optimal weight trajectory among children with obesity.

AB  - Housing plays a critical role in the care outcomes of individuals living with a HIV, yet few studies have examined the unique housing profiles of women living with HIV (WLH), especially among those belonging to low-income racial/ethnic minority groups. In this study, authors conducted a latent class analysis to generate latent profiles of women (N = 1,501) according to their housing status and household characteristics and assessed associations between classes and sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics and between classes and three HIV care outcomes: retention in care, viral suppression, and sustained viral suppression. A three-class model was selected using five dichotomized housing indicators: housing status, head of household status, living with minors, living with another adult, and disclosure of HIV status to adults with whom they live. While class 1 and class 2 had comparable HIV care outcomes, women in class 3—who were predominately unstably housed, living alone, and did not disclose their HIV status with those with whom they lived—had significantly lower crude odds of successful care outcomes. When accounting for sociodemographic and behavioral factors, significant differences in retention in care persisted. Findings underscore the need for tailored interventions for subgroups of low-income WLH and provide contextual details around the role of housing experiences.

AB  - Young Black gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (YB-GBMSM) are disproportionately burdened by HIV and often exhibit suboptimal engagement in HIV care. With the goal of increasing engagement in HIV care, we designed a culturally specific, theory-based group-level program, Brothers Building Brothers by Breaking Barriers (B6), which aimed to strengthen resilience and social capital among YB-GBMSM living with HIV. We conducted a pilot trial to evaluate the program's acceptability and feasibility. Through clinic-based recruitment and community outreach events, we recruited and enrolled 71 YB-GBMSM into the study. Participants were randomized to either the B6 program or a control comparison program. Post-session evaluation surveys and in-depth qualitative interviews showed B6 to have high levels of acceptability and satisfaction. Specifically, participants described benefits to interacting in a group with other YB-GBMSM, and several described increased comfort with their own gay identities after participation. No adverse events or safety concerns were reported. However, there were challenges to feasibility, as reflected in recruitment and retention rates. The B6 program was highly acceptable among YB-GBMSM living with HIV; however, innovative program delivery methods and implementation strategies will be needed to improve recruitment and retention in future implementation of B6.

AB  - Introduction: Cigarette smoking and associated high-risk behaviors are prevalent among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH), making appropriately tailored interventions targeting smoking behavior important for this group. We pilot tested a brief text-messaging intervention (TMI) as an adjunct to standard care for YEH who smoke and found promising preliminary effects of the intervention on smoking cessation. The purpose of the present study was to test the TMI's effect on the secondary outcomes of other substance use (including use of other tobacco/nicotine devices) and mental health symptoms.Methods: A total of 77 participants completed the pilot randomized controlled trial, with 40 receiving the TMI (174 automated text messages plus a group smoking counseling session and provision of nicotine patches). They completed an assessment at baseline and another three months later that evaluated use of other tobacco/nicotine devices, alcohol, marijuana, and anxiety and depression symptoms.Results: We found that the TMI helped to reduce secondary substance use behaviors and mental health symptoms among the participants; mainly there were medium effects of the intervention on changes in other tobacco/nicotine use, drinking, and anxiety and depression symptoms. The intervention did not have an effect on number of marijuana use days in the past month; however, past 30-day marijuana users who received the intervention benefited by reducing the number of times they used marijuana per day.Conclusions: In addition to helping reduce cigarette smoking, we found that a TMI for YEH was helpful in improving secondary outcomes, suggesting the promise of the TMI on benefiting YEH even beyond targeted smoking behavior.Implications: This pilot study demonstrates that by targeting cigarette smoking using a text message-based intervention among youth experiencing homelessness, effects may be seen in other areas of functioning such as other substance use and mental health.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03874585.

AB  - Key Points: Question: Do young people exiting homelessness with 24 months of portable rent subsidies and adult mentorship experience more socioeconomic inclusion relative to young people who receive only 24 months of portable rent subsidies? Findings: In this randomized clinical trial of 24 youths who transitioned out of homelessness and into market-rent housing, all socioeconomic inclusion outcomes were stable or showed nonsignificant improvements at 18 months compared with baseline; however, there were no significant improvements within the group that received mentorship relative to the group that did not receive mentorship. Meaning: The effectiveness of mentorship for young people exiting homelessness—especially under pandemic-related restrictions—is uncertain; stable socioeconomic inclusion outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic may be attributable to portable rent subsidies. Importance: There have been no published randomized clinical trials with a primary outcome of socioeconomic inclusion for young people who have experienced homelessness. Objective: To explore whether young people exiting homelessness who received rent subsidies and adult mentorship experienced more socioeconomic inclusion relative to young people who received only rent subsidies. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a convergent mixed-methods, unblinded, 2-group, parallel randomized clinical trial with 1:1 allocation embedded within a community-based framework in 3 cities in Ontario, Canada. Participants were enrolled between March 1 and September 30, 2019, and were followed up through March 31, 2022. Interventions: Participants (n = 24) were randomly assigned adult mentors (n = 13) who had been recruited and screened by community partner agencies. All participants received portable rent subsidies (subsidy not tied to a specific location) for 2 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary quantitative outcomes were self-reported measures of community integration (psychological and physical) and self-esteem—proxy indicators of socioeconomic inclusion. Community integration was measured with the Community Integration Scale, with a score range of 1 to 7 for the physical component and 4 to 20 for the psychological component; higher scores indicate higher integration. Self-esteem was measured with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, with a score range of 0 to 30; higher scores indicate greater self-esteem. Secondary quantitative outcomes included social connectedness, hopelessness, and academic and vocational participation. All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. Results: A total of 24 youths (12 women [50.0%]; mean [SD] age, 21.8 [2.2] years [range, 18-26 years]; race and ethnicity: 10 White [41.7%], 8 Black [33.3%], 2 Asian [8.3%], 2 Indigenous [8.3%], and 2 different choice [8.3%]) transitioned out of homelessness and into market-rent housing. All youths in the group that received mentorship and in the group that did not receive mentorship had stable or nonsignificant improvements in all study outcomes at the primary end point of 18 months compared with baseline (mean [SD] Community Integration Scale psychological score: mentorship group, 11.3 [2.6] at baseline and 11.2 [3.9] at 18 months; no-mentorship group, 10.8 [4.1] at baseline and 13.2 [2.9] at 18 months; mean [SD] Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score: mentorship group, 16.0 [4.6] at baseline and 18.1 [5.2] at 18 months; no-mentorship group, 16.3 [6.1] at baseline and 19.6 [5.7] at 18 months). However, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the Community Integration Scale psychological score (adjusted mean difference, −2.0; 95% CI, −5.0 to 1.0; P =.18) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score (adjusted mean difference, −1.4; 95% CI, −5.0 to 2.3; P =.44) 18 months after randomization. Ancillary analysis suggested that youths with informal mentors (mentors outside the study) at baseline felt more psychologically integrated at 18 months relative to those with no informal mentors at baseline (adjusted mean difference, 3.6; 95% CI, 0.4-6.8; P =.03). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, COVID-19 pandemic–related restrictions made it challenging for mentors and mentees to connect, which may have affected the findings. Steady socioeconomic outcomes—potentially attributable to portable rent subsidies—are noteworthy, given the socioeconomic inequities this population has faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The possible benefit of informal mentorship warrants further investigation. This small pilot study was designed with the intention of generating data and hypotheses for a full-scale study; findings should be interpreted with caution. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03779204 This randomized clinical trial explores whether young people exiting homelessness who received rent subsidies and adult mentorship experienced more socioeconomic inclusion relative to young people who received only rent subsidies.

AB  - Youth face similar rates of homelessness across rural and urban areas, yet little is known about how the health of unstably housed youth varies by location. We assessed differences in health by location (city, suburb, town, and rural) and housing status among youth facing a range of unstable housing experiences. This secondary data analysis from 8th, 9th, and 11th graders completing the 2019 Minnesota Student Survey examined youth who had experienced housing instability in the prior year (n = 10,757), including running away (48%) or experiencing homelessness (staying in shelter, couch-surfing, or rough sleeping) with (42%) or without (10%) an adult family member. We conducted multifactor analysis of variance to assess differences by location (urban, suburban, town, and rural) and housing experience for each of five health indicators: suboptimal health, depressive symptoms, suicide attempts, ≥2 sexual partners, and e-cigarette use. In main effects models, all health indicators varied based on housing status; suboptimal health, ≥2 sexual partners, and e-cigarette use also varied by location. Interaction models showed that unaccompanied homeless youth in suburbs reported poorer health compared with those in cities. Compared with suburbs, youth in towns were more likely to report ≥2 sexual partners (19.9%, 24.1%) and e-cigarette use (39.5%, 43.3%). Our findings suggest that unstably housed youth face a similar burden of poor health across locations, with only subtle differences in health indicators, yet most research focuses on urban youth. Future research is needed to identify how to best meet the health needs of unstably housed youth across locations.

AB  - There is increasing recognition and attention towards the patterns of police encounters with citizens. In this study, we examine the determinants of being stopped and questioned by the police among a heterogenous sample of adolescents and young adults, who were either people who use drugs and a comparison group, in three non-metropolitan areas of British Columbia, Canada. We conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses to identify the unique variation of frequent police encounters based on demographic characteristics and potential confounders. Of 448 young people, 92.0% reported at least one event where police stopped and questioned them in the past five years, and half (49.8%) reported frequent (four or more) police encounters in this time frame. The demographics of race, age, and gender were not significant in the analyses, whereas weekly illicit drug use, homelessness, and high visibility in the community were significantly related to frequent police encounters. Findings suggest that, controlling for demographic variables, young people who have precarious housing, use drugs, and have higher community visibility are at higher risk of police contact. Our findings also show when street involvement and drug use are controlled for, race does not determine police encounters.

AB  - The association of household food insecurity with symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and emotional dysregulation in children was examined in this study. We utilized baseline data from 134 children aged 6–12 years who were enrolled in a clinical trial investigating multinutrient supplementation as a treatment for ADHD and emotional dysregulation. Household food security status was assessed using the 18-item US Household Food Security Survey Module. The symptoms of ADHD and emotional dysregulation disorders (oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD)) were assessed using the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-5 and other comorbid emotional dysregulation symptoms were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Multiple linear regression determined associations between household food security status and symptoms of ADHD, ODD and DMDD, emotional symptoms and conduct problems. Household food insecurity was associated with more severe emotional symptoms (β = 2.30; 95% CI = 0.87–3.73; p = 0.002), conduct problems (β = 1.15; 95% CI = 0.01–2.30; p = 0.049) and total difficulties scores (β = 4.59; 95% CI = 1.82–7.37; p = 0.001) after adjusting for covariates (child's sex, parent marital status, household income, parental anxiety and other parental psychopathology). In unadjusted analyses, household food insecurity was also associated with increased ODD (β = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.21–0.95; p = 0.003) and DMDD symptoms (β = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.20–1.19; p = 0.006), but these associations attenuated to non-significance after adjusting for all covariates. Household food insecurity was associated with more severe emotional dysregulation symptoms. Discussing and addressing food insecurity may be appropriate initial steps for youths with ADHD and emotional dysregulation.

AB  - Abstract: It is important to gain more insight into specific subgroups of homeless young adults (HYA) to enable the development of tailored interventions that adequately meet their diverse needs and to improve their quality of life. Within a heterogeneous sample of HYA, we investigated whether subgroups are distinguishable based on risk‐ and protective factors for quality of life. In addition, differences between subgroups were examined regarding the socio‐demographic characteristics, the use of cognitive coping strategies and quality of life. A total of 393 HYA using shelter facilities in the Netherlands were approached to participate, between December 2011 and March 2013. Structured face‐to‐face interviews were administered approximately 2 weeks after shelter admission by trained research assistants. A latent class analysis was conducted to empirically distinguish 251 HYA in subgroups based on common risk factors (former abuse, victimisation, psychological symptoms and substance use) and protective factors (resilience, family and social support and perceived health status). Additional analysis of variance and chi‐square tests were used to compare subgroups on socio‐demographic characteristics, the use of cognitive coping strategies and quality of life. The latent class analysis yielded four highly interpretable subgroups: the at‐risk subgroup, the high‐risk and least protected subgroup, the low‐risk subgroup and the higher functioning and protected subgroup. Subgroups of HYA with lower scores in risk factors showed higher scores in protective factors, the adaptive cognitive coping strategies and quality of life. Our findings confirm the need for targeted and tailored interventions for specific subgroups of HYA. Social workers need to be attentive to the pattern of risk‐ and protective factors in each individual to determine which risk factors are prominent and need to be targeted and which protective factors need to be enhanced to improve the quality of life of HYA.

AB  - The Family Partnerships Program (FPP) is an intensive case management model that serves families with child welfare and juvenile justice involved youth who are at imminent risk of out-of-home placement. FPP is based on the belief that relationships, both with families and across systems, is foundational when supporting change with youth. Propensity score matching was utilized to determine if FPP is related to improved child welfare re-involvement outcomes when compared with treatment as usual for this population. When compared to non-FPP youth in two comparison counties, FPP youth from Larimer County, Colorado experienced 51% lower odds of juvenile justice involvement at case closure compared to remaining home, 32% lower odds of runaway/emancipation compared to remaining home, and 74% lower odds of placement compared to remaining home. When comparing a group of youth from Larimer County who did not receive FPP to youth in the comparison counties, the results are similar. Although this effect does not appear to be isolated to FPP; one possibility is that intensive case management represents an "active ingredient" of what makes Larimer County's community-based approach viable for serving the crossover youth population. Implications for program and policy development and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - This systematic review assessed peer-reviewed research studies on mortality rates of the homeless population within the United States. Extrapolated data included definitions of homelessness, mortality data sources, findings on mortality rates, and causes of premature mortality. Results demonstrate that individuals experiencing homelessness die earlier than comparison groups not experiencing homelessness. Methodology and findings varied across studies. Subpopulations included veterans, families, youth, and unsheltered. Causes of death varied across subpopulations and changed over time. Top causes of death, predominantly determined by ICD codes, stemmed from neoplasms, heart disease, and substance use disorder. Sources used for mortality data included the National Death Index (NDI), the Social Security Death Index (SSDI), state death occurrence files, and city vital statistics. Important research foci include standardization, subpopulation variations, policy implications, and the influence of mortality risk factors, such as poverty and racism.

AB  - Importance: Socioeconomic factors are associated with the prevalence of depression, but their associations with prognosis are unknown. Understanding this association would aid in the clinical management of depression.Objective: To determine whether employment status, financial strain, housing status, and educational attainment inform prognosis for adults treated for depression in primary care, independent of treatment and after accounting for clinical prognostic factors.Data Sources: The Embase, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane (CENTRAL) databases were searched from database inception to October 8, 2021.Study Selection: Inclusion criteria were as follows: randomized clinical trials that used the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R; the most common comprehensive screening and diagnostic measure of depressive and anxiety symptoms in primary care randomized clinical trials), measured socioeconomic factors at baseline, and sampled patients with unipolar depression who sought treatment for depression from general physicians/practitioners or who scored 12 or more points on the CIS-R. Exclusion criteria included patients with depression secondary to a personality or psychotic disorder or neurologic condition, studies of bipolar or psychotic depression, studies that included children or adolescents, and feasibility studies. Studies were independently assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria by 2 reviewers.Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were extracted and cleaned by data managers for each included study, further cleaned by multiple reviewers, and cross-checked by study chief investigators. Risk of bias and quality were assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tools, respectively. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses-Individual Participant Data (PRISMA-IPD) reporting guidelines.Main Outcomes and Measures: Depressive symptoms at 3 to 4 months after baseline.Results: This systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis identified 9 eligible studies that provided individual patient data for 4864 patients (mean [SD] age, 42.5 (14.0) years; 3279 women [67.4%]). The 2-stage random-effects meta-analysis end point depressive symptom scale scores were 28% (95% CI, 20%-36%) higher for unemployed patients than for employed patients and 18% (95% CI, 6%-30%) lower for patients who were homeowners than for patients living with family or friends, in hostels, or homeless, which were equivalent to 4.2 points (95% CI, 3.6-6.2 points) and 2.9 points (95% CI, 1.1-4.9 points) on the Beck Depression Inventory II, respectively. Financial strain and educational attainment were associated with prognosis independent of treatment, but unlike employment and housing status, there was little evidence of associations after adjusting for clinical prognostic factors.Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that unemployment was associated with a poor prognosis whereas home ownership was associated with improved prognosis. These differences were clinically important and independent of the type of treatment received. Interventions that address employment or housing difficulties could improve outcomes for patients with depression.

AB  - Background There is scarce evidence on prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among individuals who are homeless and diagnosed with severe mental illness. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of HCV infection and associated risk factors in a representative sample of adults from At Home study. Methods The Vancouver At Home study is part of the At Home/Chez Soi (AH/CS) project—a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of a Housing First intervention among homeless persons with mental illness in five Canadian cities between 2009 and 2013 with a 2-year follow-up period. Results Of 497 participants, 28% reported positive HCV serostatus. Educational level equal or less than eighth grade (AOR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 4.8), history of incarceration (AOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.5), substance dependence (AOR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.1, 3.7) and injection drug use during one month prior to the recruitment (AOR: 7.8, 95% CI: 4.0, 15.0) were associated with an increased risk of HCV infection. Having a psychotic disorder (AOR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.3, 1.0) and age < 25 (AOR: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.0, 0.7) were associated with a lower risk. Blood tests performed on 30 participants agreed with self-report in 97% of cases [Kappa = 0.9 (95% CI: 0.6, 1.3), PABAK = 0.9]. Conclusion The high prevalence of HCV among individuals who were homeless with mental illness underlies the importance of prevention and treatment of HCV in this population, especially those with concurrent substance use disorders. Self-report seems to be a valid tool for evaluation of the HCV status in this population.

AB  - Suicide remains the leading cause of death among homeless youth. We assessed differences in health-care utilization between homeless and nonhomeless youth presenting to the emergency department or hospital after a suicide attempt. New York Statewide Inpatient and Emergency Department Databases (2009–2014) were used to identify homeless and nonhomeless youth aged 10–17 who utilized health-care services following a suicide attempt. To evaluate associations with homelessness, we used logistic regression models for use of violent means, intensive care unit utilization, log-transformed linear regression models for hospitalization cost, and negative binomial regression models for length of stay. All models adjusted for individual characteristics with a hospital random effect and year fixed effect. We identified 18,026 suicide attempts with health-care utilization rates of 347.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 317.5, 377.0) and 67.3 (95% CI: 66.3, 68.3) per 100,000 person-years for homeless and nonhomeless youth, respectively. Length of stay for homeless youth was statistically longer than that for nonhomeless youth (incidence rate ratio = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.32, 1.77). All homeless youth who visited the emergency department after a suicide attempt were subsequently hospitalized. This could suggest a higher acuity upon presentation among homeless youth compared with nonhomeless youth. Interventions tailored to homeless youth should be developed.

AB  - The present Canadian study sought to identify predictors of emergency department (ED) use in a sample of adults who are homeless. Four hundred eighty-three participants were interviewed quarterly for two years, reporting their housing status, income, food security, physical/mental health, and other social determinants of health. Survey data were linked to administrative health and social services data. Predictors of ED visits were analyzed using negative binomial longitudinal mixed modelling. Emergency department visits were positively and reliably predicted by pre-baseline ED use, as well as by concurrent increased social assistance, primary care visits, ratings of physical health, substance use problems, and case management visits. Increased concurrent housing instability and food insecurity, and decreased homelessness history, positively predicted ED visits, but effect reliability was lower. Participant ill health appears to be a primary driver of ED utilization. The findings challenge misconceptions about the appropriateness of ED use among people who are homeless.

AB  - Street-connected young people (SCYP) in the Republic of Georgia are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. We conducted a mixed-methods study utilizing a triangulation design with N = 20 SCYP aged 11–18 (50% female; M = 13.95 years; SD = 2.11) recruited from two cities in Georgia. SCYP completed a close-ended survey and an in-depth interview on their perceptions of romantic and exchange sex relationships. Quantitative analyses examined gender differences in perceptions of romantic and exchange sex partners, and qualitative data was analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Quantitative findings indicated that a higher proportion of female than male SCYP endorsed engaging in HIV-related transmission behaviors with exchange sex partners. Thematic analysis contextualized survey findings by elucidating the ways in which females negotiated a highly gendered risk environment that elevated their vulnerability to HIV. Study results highlight the need for gender-responsive programming to address the HIV prevention needs of both male and female SCYP in the Republic of Georgia.

AB  - Experiencing sexual victimization prior to becoming homeless is common among homeless youth and is associated with increased HIV risk behavior. This study examined mediating variables that underlie this association, adding to the understanding of gender differences in these paths. Participants were homeless youth in Los Angeles recruited through service access centers who completed a computerized self-administered interview in English or Spanish using an iPad. Findings indicate a high presence of sexual victimization across both genders. Female participants experienced posttraumatic stress disorder and subsequent engagement with exchange sex, whereas male participants were primarily involved in substance use risk pathways. Results indicate paths in the association between sexual victimization and HIV risk behavior differ between male and female homeless youth. Gender-specific, mental-health-informed interventions targeting sexual risk reduction are warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Runaway youth and homeless youth are at risk for adverse mental health outcomes. These 2 populations are frequently pooled together in both research and interventions yet may have unique health needs. We sought to assess differences in mental health outcomes among these populations. METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis of ninth- and 11th-graders in the 2016 minnesota Student Survey (n = 68 785). We categorized youth into 4 subgroups based on housing status in the previous year: (1) unaccompanied homeless youth (0.5%), (2) runaway youth (4%), (3) youth who had both run away and been homeless (0.6%), and (4) stably housed youth (95%). We performed multivariable logistic regression to compare 4 mental health outcomes (self-injury, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and depressive symptoms) across groups, controlling for demographics and abuse history. RESULTS: Unstably housed youth had poorer mental health outcomes when compared with their stably housed peers (P < .05). For example, 11% of homeless youth, 20% of runaways, and 33% of youth who had experienced both had attempted suicide in the previous year compared with 2% of stably housed youth (adjusted odds ratios 2.4, 4.9, and 7.1, respectively). Other outcomes showed a similar pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that runaway and homeless youth represent unique populations with high levels of mental health needs who would benefit from targeted clinical and community interventions. Pediatric clinicians represent one potential point of screening and intervention.

AB  - Frailty is a deficit accumulation in physical, psychological and social domains. Correlates of frailty were explored among formerly incarcerated, homeless women (N = 130, Mage = 38.9). Significant correlates of physical frailty were age, years homeless, prior violence, witnessing less violence, drug dependence, PTSD symptoms and tangible support. Significant correlates of psychological frailty were age, years homeless, witnessed violence, jail time, divorced less, drug use/dependence, prison time, methamphetamine use, and bodily pain. Significant correlates of social frailty were drug use, emotional regulation, and daily alcohol use. Reentry interventions are needed for formerly incarcerated, homeless women who experience physical, psychological and social frailty.

AB  - Objectives: In this study, we characterized alcohol use behaviors by sex among sheltered homeless adults and explored associations with health and readiness to change drinking behaviors. Methods: Participants (N = 581; 63.7% men; Mage= 43.6, 29.4% white) self-reported alcohol use and readiness to change drinking behaviors. Sex differences were analyzed via Wilcoxon ranksum, chi-square tests, logistic regression, and ANCOVAs. Results: Overall, 38.5% of the sample met criteria for current at-risk drinking, 39.7% self-reported a history of alcohol problems, and 22.9% reported having a formal alcohol use disorder (AUD) diagnosis. Among current alcohol users, 83.8% reported at-risk drinking. Men had more drinks per drinking day, more drinks per week, and more drinking days per week when compared to women. No sex differences were found for at-risk drinking, self-reported alcohol problems, probable alcohol abuse/dependence, AUD diagnosis, readiness to change drinking, or recent alcohol/substance abuse counseling. Conclusions: High rates of at-risk drinking were found among alcohol users. Homeless men and women did not exhibit differences in several manifestations of problematic alcohol use. Alcohol use interventions might be equally appealing to both sexes given equivalent readiness to change drinking; however, rates of recent treatment receipt were low.

AB  - This study provides information on COVID-19 vaccination and attitudes among young adults with recent experiences of homelessness. Participants (n = 134) from a clinical trial of a risk reduction program for youth experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles completed survey items about COVID-19 vaccinations between March and October 2021. A total of 29% of respondents were vaccinated, and 50% were not interested in getting vaccinated. Among the unvaccinated, 58% had not been offered the vaccine; furthermore, 38%–45% had strong distrust of the vaccine and were worried about its harmfulness. Vaccination status was generally unrelated to demographics, housing instability, service use, substance use, or mental health. Our data suggest that vaccination rates are lower among young adults with recent experiences of homelessness than those in the general US population. The results suggest a need for greater direct outreach that includes both offering the vaccine and addressing misconceptions about its safety to increase vaccination rates in this population.

AB  - Objective: We characterized lifetime drinking trajectories among persons living with HIV (PLWH) and examined how trajectories are related to health.Method: Adults (ages 20-71) were recruited between 2015 and 2017 for a cohort study examining the impact of alcohol use on geriatric comorbidities in PLWH in New Orleans. The New Orleans Alcohol Use in HIV (NOAH) Study (n = 356; 68.8% male) included in-person interviews, anthropometric measurements, and biospecimen collection. Average monthly drinks per decade of life was derived from participants' reported average quantity and frequency of alcoholic beverages for each decade. Health indicators included CD4 count, viral load, health-related quality of life, frailty, comorbidities, body mass index, heavy drinking, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Participants also reported lifetime experiences with homelessness and incarceration. Latent curve modeling was applied in MPlus to derive lifetime drinking trajectories. Latent trajectory parameters were modeled as predictors of physical, mental, and social health, controlling for demographics.Results: Alcohol consumption increased significantly between the teen years and midlife (31-40), declining thereafter through ages 50-60. Significant interindividual differences were observed in all trajectory parameters. Persons with higher starting points of alcohol consumption showed worse mental health (depression and anxiety) and social experiences (homelessness and incarceration history) at study baseline. A steeper increase in volume of alcohol consumption after ages 10-20 was associated with worse health-related quality of life, greater frailty and comorbidities, and greater odds of current heavy drinking.Conclusions: Understanding lifetime alcohol consumption patterns is important in addressing physical and mental health among adult PLWH.

AB  - Homeless young adults often seek health care at emergency departments (EDs) after they are no longer able to ignore a pressing health problem. However, a dearth of literature examines homeless young adults' ED visits. This study aimed to increase understanding of ED visits among homeless young adults within the U.S. Data for this study were obtained from the 2011–2015 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. The sample for this study included all ED visits made by homeless and housed young adults aged 18–29 years (unweighted N = 25,068). ED visits by homeless young adults were distinguished in terms of gender, region, payment sources, and triage level. Furthermore, ED visits made by homeless young adults were more likely related to mental health and suicide. Homeless young adults' ED visits were characterized by a longer average length of stay and were less likely to be referred to a physician or clinic for follow-up, given medication, or have a procedure performed in the ED. This study highlighted differences in ED utilization for homeless young adults. The findings of this study suggest a need to further examine the characteristics of ED services received by homeless young adults to better understand differences in ED service receipt related to housing status. This knowledge can inform efforts to reduce costs through improving access to housing and outpatient mental health care and reducing stigma among health care professionals to ensure continuity of care.

AB  - Despite the high prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts among homeless youth, little research has examined how suicide prevention interventions influence suicide-related risk and protective factors, and ultimately produce positive outcome in suicidality in this population. Drawing on the Diathesis-Stress Model and the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, the current study examined whether participation in Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) moderated the mediation link between social problem-solving, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, and suicidal ideation among a sample of homeless youth experiencing suicidal ideation. Social problem-solving refers to a set of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral coping responses in the face of stressful situations, and it is identified as a potent protective factor in alleviating perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, and reducing suicidal ideation. Participants included 150 homeless youth (M age = 20.99, range = 18-24; 41% female) who were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) (n = 75) or Treatment as Usual alone (n = 75). Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Findings showed that perceived burdensomeness mediated the association of social problem-solving with suicidal ideation only among youth participating in the CTSP condition. These findings provide evidence to support the promising effects of CTSP in enhancing the protective effects of social problem-solving on suicidal ideation through the mediating effects of perceived burdensomeness. Findings also have implications for improving intervention effectiveness with a community-based population at high risk of suicide.

AB  - Young people transitioning from out-of-home care, commonly called care leavers, are known to be a vulnerable group. Many experience poor outcomes leading them to become homeless or involved in the criminal justice system. Yet compared to most other Anglophone democracies, Australia lacks mandatory assistance for care leavers beyond 18 years of age. There are also major legislative, policy, and program differences between care leaver entitlements in the individual states and territories. This paper argues that the Commonwealth Government should introduce a nationally consistent extended care system that would require all jurisdictions to provide a minimum standard of support until at least 21 years of age. A uniform set of extended care standards is even more vital in the context of COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS Many Australian care leavers have poor life chances despite recent advances in the support programs provided by the states and territories. A nationally consistent extended care program is likely to progress improved opportunities and outcomes for care leavers.

AB  - Housing insecurity is a persistent issue in marginalized communities. Maternal depression and substance use contribute additional housing risk for vulnerable families. Maternal mental health problems may erode or disrupt social networks, leaving families with fewer supports upon which to rely in a housing crisis. The present study leveraged a large, longitudinal sample of families with children (N = 2,991). Structural equation modeling with latent variables investigated the role of perceived instrumental support in pathways from maternal depression and substance use to risk for housing insecurity over a 10-year period. Results indicated maternal depression was linked directly with housing insecurity (β = 0.16, p < 0.001), as well as indirectly via reduced perceived instrumental support (β = 0.01, p < 0.05). Maternal substance use was not associated either directly or indirectly with housing insecurity. Social support thus emerged as an important mechanism explaining an enduring association between maternal depression and risk for housing insecurity. Highlights: Structural equation modeling tested links from maternal mental health problems to housing insecurity via perceived instrumental support Maternal depression was directly associated with greater risk of housing insecurity among at-risk families with adolescents Lower perceived support mediated the link between maternal depression and risk for housing insecurity Maternal substance use was neither directly nor indirectly associated with housing insecurity

AB  - • Providers encounter more commonly identified sex trafficking indicators than the sex trafficking specific ones that are often highlighted in community settings. • Providers who work in these systems may not be consistently assessing for sex trafficking, despite consistently identifying sex trafficking indicators. • Sex trafficking specific trainings may make some differences in providers' actions, though more work is needed to understand their impact. The extent to which service providers across systems identify and assess potentially sex trafficked youth is understudied. The purpose of this study is to determine whether and how providers observe relevant indicators and assess for sex trafficking risk among minors (ages 12–17), young adults (ages 18–29), and families of minors. A cross-sectional, web-based survey was disseminated to service providers, who represented child welfare, youth justice, and social services (e.g. runaway youth, sexual violence), in a region of a Midwestern state (United States). Participants (N = 267) were asked whether they provided direct services to minors (ages 12–17, n = 245), adults (ages 18–29, n = 148), and/or families/foster families of minors (ages 12–17, n = 163), resulting in three respective client groups. Survey items assessed the extent to which providers (1) identified possible sex trafficking indicators across 5 domains; (2) took follow up actions; and (3) asked risk assessment questions. T-tests were conducted to examine differences between those who reported receiving sex trafficking trainings, compared to those who did not. Results suggest that the most commonly identified indicators included depressive symptoms, shame and guilt, lack of social support. Least common indicators included torture, false IDs, hotel involvement. A third of minor-aged providers did not ask sex trafficking risk assessment questions. Providers reported asking fewer clients about online sex trading than in-person forms. There were statistically significant differences among providers who received training. Implications, including provider strategies for assessing online sex trading and organizational protocols to enhance sex trafficking identification, are discussed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Assessing and meeting the needs of the mentally ill as well as the way these needs are related to the quality of life, contribute to improved mental health care services. OBJECTIVE: Investigating the degree of correlation between needs, as measured by the Camberwell Assessment of Need tool, and the quality of life of mentally ill. METHOD: A systematic review of the research literature was applied. Relevant articles were searched in the databases PUBMED, CINAHL and COCHRANE. Studies included were published from 01/01/2000 until 31/07/2018, in which the participants were psychiatric patients 18- 65 years. Were also included studies using the Camberwell Assessment of Need as a needs assessment tool, since it is the only tool whose reliability and validity have been adequately documented through international studies. Studies involving subjects with substance use diagnosis, learning disabilities, dementia or other organic psycho-syndromes, homeless or imprisoned were excluded. Were also excluded studies that did not investigate the two key variables, and in particular their degree of correlation. RESULTS: 9 quantitative studies were included. 2 of them were cross-sectional, 6 longitudinal studies and one randomized controlled trial with prospective design, with intervention group and control group. In most studies, moderate to strong correlations were found between the number of unmet needs and quality of life. The level of self-reported quality of life could be predicted over time by the number of unmet needs, mainly in the social field. CONCLUSIONS: Satisfying mainly social needs, in addition to reducing psychiatric symptoms, seems to be of particular importance in ensuring a better quality of life for people with mental disorders. Needs assessment will contribute in the development of appropriate interventions to meet the needs of patients with mental illness, as well as to improve their quality of life.

ΜΕΘΟΔΟΣ: Πραγματοποιήθηκε συστηματική ανασκόπηση της ερευνητικής βιβλιογραφίας. Η αναζήτηση των μελετών έγινε στις βάσεις δεδο- μένων PUBMED, CINAHL και COCHRANE. Συμπε- ριλήφθησαν μελέτες οι οποίες έχουν δημοσιευ- θεί από την 01/01/2000 μέχρι και την 31/07/2018, στις οποίες οι συμμετέχοντες ήταν άτομα με ψυ- χικό νόσημα ηλικίας 18-65 ετών. Επίσης, συμπε- ριλήφθησαν μελέτες οι οποίες χρησιμοποιούσαν το Camberwell Assessment of Need ως εργαλείο εκτίμησης των αναγκών, αφού είναι το μοναδικό εργαλείο του οποίου έχει τεκμηριωθεί επαρκώς η αξιοπιστία και η εγκυρότητα μέσα από διεθνείς μελέτες. Αποκλείστηκαν μελέτες οι οποίες περι- λάμβαναν στο δείγμα άτομα με διάγνωση χρήση ουσιών, με μαθησιακές δυσκολίες, άνοια ή άλλα οργανικά ψυχοσύνδρομα, άστεγους ή φυλακι- σμένους. Αποκλείστηκαν μελέτες οι οποίες δεν διερευνούσαν τις δύο βασικές μεταβλητές και πιο συγκεκριμένα το βαθμό συσχέτισής τους. ΑΠΟΤΕΛΕΣΜΑΤΑ: Συμπεριλήφθησαν 9 ποσοτι- κές μελέτες, 2 συγχρονικές, 6 διαχρονικές και μια τυχαιοποιημένη ελεγχόμενη μελέτη με προοπτι- κό σχεδιασμό, με ομάδα παρέμβασης και ομάδα ελέγχου. Στις περισσότερες μελέτες βρέθηκαν μέτριες έως ισχυρές συσχετίσεις ανάμεσα στον αριθμό των ακάλυπτων κυρίως αναγκών, με την ποιότητα ζωής. Το επίπεδο αυτό-αναφερόμενης ποιότητας ζωής θα μπορούσε να προβλεφτεί δι- αχρονικά από τον αριθμό των ακάλυπτων ανα- γκών, κυρίως στο κοινωνικό πεδίο. ΣΎΜΠΕΡΑΣΜΑΤΑ: Η ικανοποίηση των κοινωνι- κών αναγκών, πέρα από τη μείωση των συμπτω- μάτων, φαίνεται να έχει ιδιαίτερη σημασία για την εξασφάλιση καλύτερης ποιότητας ζωής για τα άτομα με ψυχικές διαταραχές. Η εκτίμηση των αναγκών αναμένεται να συμβάλει στην ανάπτυ- ξη των κατάλληλων παρεμβάσεων για την κάλυ- ψη των αναγκών των ασθενών με ψυχική νόσο, καθώς επίσης και στην βελτίωση της ποιότητας ζωής τους.

AB  - Background: Youth experiencing homelessness are at high risk for suicide, yet few studies have evaluated risk reduction interventions targeting suicidal ideation in this vulnerable population. A comprehensive approach to risk-reduction is needed that addresses basic needs and provides targeted interventions for those at highest risk. The protocol described builds on the design of the first randomized trial of Housing First (HF) for homeless youth. The primary objective is to determine whether housing combined with supportive services that include suicide screening and targeted psychotherapy (Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention) is effective for reducing suicidal ideation and other secondary outcomes (depression and suicide attempts). Additionally, we will explore mediators of the treatment effect (housing stability and substance use) and determinants of implementation.Methods: Youth recruited to the HF trial will be randomized to HF + supportive services (n = 120), or supportive services alone (n = 120). The "Suicide Treatment Education and Prevention" (STEP) protocol will additionally screen youth in both arms at baseline and 3 months for suicidal ideation (SSI-W). Those who screen as moderate risk for suicide (SSI-W ≥ 10) will be offered CTSP, which includes up to 9 sessions over the first 6 months following enrollment. CTSP will be delivered in one-on-one sessions by a trained advocate. Research assessments will be collected to assess outcomes (including suicidal ideation) at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Qualitative interviews with subjects receiving CTSP and other stakeholders will explore implementation determinants.Discussion: The study will fill an important gap in the literature about the added benefit of HF combined with supportive services including suicide screening and treatment for reducing suicidal ideation in homeless youth. With the urgent need to address both homelessness and suicide risk, evidence is needed about services that can be integrated into delivery settings for youth experiencing homelessness.Trial Registration: NCT04135703 . Date of registration: October 23, 2019.

AB  - Aims: Homeless mothers with young children in their care contend with high rates of substance use and low self-efficacy. However, a limited number of studies have examined these outcomes associated with housing and supportive services.Design: Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) housing + support services (n = 80), (2) housing-only (n = 80), or (3) services as usual (SAU) (n = 80) and were re-assessed at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months postbaseline.Settings: The study recruited a community-based sample from homeless service agencies and advertisements in a large Midwestern city.Participants: The study recruited two hundred forty (N = 240) women between the ages of 18 to 24 years, experiencing homelessness and with a substance use disorder (SUD) who also had a biological child under the age of 6 years in their care.Measurements: We measured frequency of alcohol and drug use using the Form 90 semi-structured interview, and self-efficacy using Pearlin and Schooler's (1978) 7-item Mastery Scale.Findings: Overall, mothers showed significant improvement in substance use and self-efficacy over time in each condition. However, as expected, patterns of change differentiated intervention groups with more mothers showing better substance use and self-efficacy outcomes in housing + supportive services than in SAU. Unexpectedly, more mothers in SAU showed better outcomes than those in housing-only.Conclusions: Substance use decreased and self-efficacy increased over time, but patterns of change characterized the intervention groups. In particular, findings suggest that when providing housing to this population, supportive services should also be offered.

AB  - Most studies of condomless sex among homeless youth have focused on peer norms, while excluding other potentially pertinent influences. This study explored how different types of relationships contributed to norms about condomless sex and whether such norms were associated with engagement in condomless sex among homeless youth. Additionally, because recent work has noted gender differences in social networks of male and female homeless youth, gender differences in social network norms of condomless sex were also assessed. Egocentric network data were collected from homeless youth accessing services at two drop-in centers in Los Angeles, CA (N = 976). Multivariate analyses (non-stratified and stratified by gender) assessed associations between descriptive, injunctive, and communicative norms and participants' engagement in condomless sex. Multivariate analyses indicated that perception of peer condom use and communication with sexual partners were significantly associated with not engaging in condomless sex. These relationships, however, varied by gender. Implications for interventions are discussed.

AB  - Background: Tuberculosis (TB) disproportionately affects marginalized and impoverished homeless adults. Although active TB can be prevented by treating latent TB infection (LTBI), individual factors, such as high prevalence of depression and anxiety, drug and alcohol use, and unstable housing, lead to poor LTBI treatment adherence and completion among homeless adults. Objectives: We hypothesized that the delivery of a tailored nurse-led, community health worker (RN/CHW) program across the LTBI continuum of care (e.g. screening, diagnosis, and treatment) that delivers 3HP treatment (3HP: rifapentine plus isoniazid) for homeless adults (e.g. sheltered and unsheltered) and is tailored to their health and social service needs will overcome existing treatment completion barriers. We also hypothesized that mental health symptoms (e.g. depression and anxiety), drug use score, and problematic alcohol use will decline over time among clients receiving this treatment. Methods : We assessed the effect of delivering a theoretically guided, RN/CHW-based, single-arm study among eligible LTBI-positive homeless adults (N = 50) on completion of a weekly, directly observed, 12-dose 3HP LTBI treatment in Central City East (Skid Row). Completing 3HP treatment was compared to the only known historical, clinic-based control that obtained 65% completion among homeless adults. Secondary outcomes included drug and alcohol use, depression, and anxiety. Results : The RN/CHW program achieved a 91.8% 3HP treatment completion rate among homeless adults. Younger homeless adults (<50 years old) were less likely to complete 3HP treatment compared to those who were older. Neither drug use, depression, nor anxiety was associated with 3HP treatment completion. Decrease in anxiety was observed at 3 months, but not at 6 months, compared to baseline. Discussion : To our knowledge, the pilot study is the first to evaluate an effective RN/CHW-delivered, community-based intervention, which can reduce the burden of active TB for homeless adults.

AB  - Substance use is highly prevalent among youth living with HIV (YLWH) and negatively impacts HIV care. This study sought to determine whether the CRAFFT (Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, and Trouble), designed to screen for problematic substance use, is reliably associated with substance use behaviors among YLWH. A cross-sectional sample of 2216 youth (ages 12-26) were recruited through the adolescent medicine trials network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. Participants completed a self-administered survey. Over half screened positive on the CRAFFT (i.e., ≥2). Among frequent substance users, those older in age, behaviorally infected, with history of incarceration or unstably housed were more likely to screen positive on the CRAFFT. Study findings suggest that the CRAFFT reliably identifies youth who use substances. Thus, screening measures such as the CRAFFT should be utilized routinely in HIV clinical settings for youth.
AB  - El uso de sustancias entre jóvenes que viven con el VIH es muy prevalente y afecta negativamente el cuidado del VIH. Este estudio trató de determinar si el CRAFFT, una prueba diseñada para detectar el uso problemático de sustancias, se asocia con fiabilidad con comportamientos de consumo de sustancias entre los jóvenes que viven con el VIH. Una muestra transversal de 2216 jóvenes (edades 12-26) fueron reclutados a través del Adolescent Medicine Trials Network para Intervenciones contra el VIH/SIDA. Los participantes completaron una encuesta autoadministrada. Más de la mitad fueron seleccionados como positivos por el CRAFFT (es decir, ≥2). Entre los usuarios frecuentes de sustancias, los mayores de edad, los infectados por conducta en comparación con aquellos infectados perinatalmente, y aquellos con antecedentes de encarcelamiento y viviendas inestables fueron más propensos a resultados positivos en el CRAFFT. Los hallazgos del estudio sugieren que el CRAFFT identifica de manera fiable a los jóvenes que usan sustancias. Por lo tanto, pruebas como el CRAFFT deben utilizarse de forma rutinaria en contextos clínicos de VIH para los jóvenes.

AB  - A randomized trial compared effects of a Family Critical Time Intervention (FCTI) to usual care for children in 200 newly homeless families in which mothers had diagnosable mental illness or substance problems. Adapted from an evidence-based practice to prevent chronic homelessness for adults with mental illnesses, FCTI combines housing and structured, time-limited case management to connect families leaving shelter with community services. Families were followed at five time points over 24 months. Data on 311 children-99 ages 1.5-5 years, 113 ages 6-10 years, and 99 ages 11-16 years-included mother-, teacher-, and child-reports of mental health, school experiences, and psychosocial well-being. Analyses used hierarchical linear modeling to investigate intervention effects and changes in child functioning over time. Referral to FCTI reduced internalizing and externalizing problems in preschool-aged children and externalizing for adolescents 11-16. The intervention led to declines in self-reported school troubles for children 6-10 and 11-16. Both experimental and control children in all age groups showed reductions in symptoms over time. Although experimental results were scattered, they suggest that FCTI has the potential to improve mental health and school outcomes for children experiencing homelessness.

AB  - This study identifies subgroups of tenants in a sample of 495 tenants at risk of eviction, due to rent arrears, by 16 housing associations in five Dutch municipalities, and examines the attuning of services to the needs of the tenants in these subgroups. Latent class analysis with eight known risk factors for eviction identified five subgroups of tenants, which can be characterised as young immigrants, native Dutch tenants with little support, highly educated native Dutch tenants with much support, depressed tenants with little support and highly educated mentally stable older single tenants. The young immigrants reported the highest number of unmet care needs; the highly educated native Dutch tenants with much support, on the other hand, mentioned the least unmet care needs. This study demonstrates the diversity of a population of tenants at risk of eviction. Together with the differences in care needs, this indicates the necessity to develop targeted and personalised interventions to prevent evictions.

AB  - Access to appropriate health and social care is challenging for vulnerable populations. We used a 'pop-up' delivery model to bring community-based services in contact with communities with poor access to health and social care. Our aim was to examine whether pop-up events improve access to essential health and social support services for selected vulnerable communities and increase collaboration between community-based health and social services. Set in south-eastern Melbourne, two pop-up events were held, one with people at risk of homelessness attending a community lunch and the other with South Sudanese women helping at-risk youth. Providers represented 20 dental, housing, justice, employment and mental health services. We made structured observations of each event and held semi-structured interviews with consumers and providers. Pre-post surveys of managers assessed acceptability and perceived impact. We reached 100 community participants who had multiple needs, particularly for dentistry. Following the events, participants reported increased knowledge of services and access pathways, community members spoke of increased trust and partnerships between service providers were fostered. The pop-up model can increase provider collaboration and provide new options for vulnerable populations to access needed services. 'Bringing the service to the person' is a compelling alternative to asking consumers to negotiate complex access pathways. Vulnerable communities have the greatest need for primary care but experience disproportionate barriers to service access. We trialled a pop-up health service delivery model in two vulnerable communities in metropolitan Melbourne. Our evaluation suggests that the model was feasible and has the potential to both improve access for vulnerable communities and promote collaboration between service providers, adding to the evidence base regarding mobile and outreach projects for vulnerable communities.

AB  - Objective: To identify the impact of volunteering in a street medicine programme on perceptions of and attitudes towards individuals experiencing homelessness. Design: Prospective pre- and post-analysis using involvement in a street medicine programme as the intervention. Attitudes towards and perceptions of individuals experiencing homelessness were measured using the Health Professional Attitude Towards the Homeless Inventory (HPATHI). Setting: Participants provided outreach to individuals experiencing homelessness across metro Phoenix in parks and in homeless encampments along the streets. Method: Students and preceptors from numerous professions, including medicine, nursing, social work, physical therapy, occupational therapy, public health and undergraduate students, who volunteered for the street medicine programme were organised into small outreach teams. All volunteers were emailed the HPATHI to complete before and after semester-long, monthly outreach events. Results: Volunteering in our street medicine programme demonstrated statistically significant improvements in perceptions of and attitudes towards individuals experiencing homelessness for all volunteers, regardless of profession. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that integrating street medicine programmes into curricula for health and social care programmes can reduce the stigma towards individuals experiencing homelessness, inspire increased commitment to practising in underserved communities and meet the unmet health and social needs of the homeless population.

AB  - Depression and substance use are significant obstacles to effective HIV care. Using data derived from a randomized controlled trial of persons with HIV who are homeless or marginally housed, this study assesses the utility of antidepressant treatment among persons with HIV, depression, and active substance use. Participants were diagnosed with depressive disorders and randomly assigned to receive directly observed therapy with fluoxetine or a referral to community mental health treatment. Assessments, conducted at baseline and every 3 months over a 9-month period, included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the Beck Depression Inventory II, and self-report of alcohol, crack, cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamine use in the past 90 days. To investigate the effect of antidepressant treatment in the setting of active substance use, the authors fit mixed-effects linear regression models to estimate the effect of directly observed fluoxetine on depressive symptom severity after stratifying by any alcohol use or any illicit drug use. To investigate whether alcohol use or illicit drug use moderated the antidepressant treatment response, the authors examined the interaction terms. The effect of directly observed fluoxetine treatment on depression symptom severity was statistically significant irrespective of alcohol use status. When stratified by illicit drug use status, the effect of directly observed fluoxetine treatment on depression symptom severity was statistically significant only among persons who did not use illicit drugs. The interaction terms were not statistically significant. This study found a benefit of antidepressant treatment in persons with HIV, depression, and alcohol use. In addition, this study found no evidence that either alcohol use or illicit drug use moderates the antidepressant treatment response. Altogether, these findings support the use of antidepressant medication in this population. The public health impact of research in this area is significant given the known adverse effects of depression on HIV-related health outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00338767.

AB  - Aim: COVID-19 has exacerbated food insecurity, unemployment, inequities and poverty in Aotearoa. Here, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to malnutrition due to household food insecurity during foetal life and early infancy is associated with body composition in adolescence.Methods: As part of the Pacific Islands Families Study, 1,376 Pacific Island mothers were asked questions about food security at six weeks postpartum in the year 2000. At age 14 years, 931 youth completed in-school assessments of height and weight. Of these youth, 10 girls and 10 boys from each weight decile were randomly selected to participate in a nested sub-study involving dual x-ray absorptiometry measurements, which included appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASMM) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT).Results: Boys born to families experiencing food insecurity had greater birthweights and greater % fat, less % ASMM and greater % VAT of total weight at age 14 years compared to boys born into food secure households. In contrast, there were no differences in birthweight or body composition at age 14 years by household food insecurity status among girls.Conclusion: This study shows that household food insecurity during early development is associated with higher abdominal and visceral fat in boys, which may have health risks in later life.

AB  - Homelessness is associated with a range of negative health and behavioral outcomes, yet life-course pathways to homelessness from adolescence to early adulthood are not well-documented. This study asks to what extent do early-mid adolescent risk and protective factors predict young adult homelessness, and whether the predictive nature of these factors is similar in Victoria, Australia, and Washington State in the USA. As part of the International Youth Development Study, adolescents were recruited as state representative secondary school samples at grade 7 (age 13, 2002) and longitudinally compared at average age 25. Higher rates of past year homelessness were reported by Washington State (5.24%), compared to Victorian young adults (3.25%). Although some cross-state differences in levels of adolescent demographic, individual, family, peer group, school, and community predictors were found, cross-state comparisons showed these factors were equally predictive of young adult homelessness in both states. In univariate analyses, most adolescent risk and protective factors were significant predictors. Unique multivariate adolescent predictors associated with young adult homelessness included school suspension (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.76) and academic failure (AOR = 1.94). No significant unique protective effects were found. Prevention and intervention efforts that support adolescents' academic engagement may help in addressing young adult homelessness. The similar cross-state profile of adolescent predictors suggests that programs seeking to support academic engagement may influence risk for homelessness into young adulthood in both states. The similarity in life-course pathways to homelessness suggests that the USA and Australia can profitably translate prevention and intervention efforts to reduce homelessness while continuing to identify modifiable predictors.

AB  - Background Transgender women are disproportionately incarcerated in the US relative to the general population. A dearth of research has explored the factors that predict incarceration among transgender women or the longitudinal impact of incarceration on the health of this population. Methods Between 2012 and 2015, 221 transgender women ages 16–29 from Boston, MA and Chicago, IL were prospectively assessed at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months. Mixed effects models were used to identify risk factors for incarceration and examine whether incarceration predicts somatic, anxiety and depressive symptoms, illicit drug use, and binge drinking over time, controlling for baseline psychiatric and substance use disorders. Results Overall, 38% experienced incarceration, before (33%) and during (18%) the study period. Significant independent predictors of recent incarceration included sex work, recent homelessness, school dropout and number of times incarcerated prior to enrollment while recent incarceration significantly predicted somatic symptoms and illicit drug use over time. Conclusions Incarceration burden is high in young transgender women. Both structural and individual risk factors predict incarceration and poor health, suggesting the need for multilevel interventions to prevent incarceration and support young transgender women during incarceration and upon release.

AB  - Little is known about human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination uptake among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH), who may be at higher risk for HPV than their housed counterparts. We examined the prevalence and associations of HPV vaccination initiation and completion among YEH. Guided by the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, we analyzed cross-sectional data collected from YEH (N = 1074; ages 18-26) in seven U.S. cities to assess HPV vaccination prevalence and to identify predisposing, enabling, and need factors associated with HPV vaccination status. Due to timing differences in the release of HPV vaccine recommendations, we conducted separate logistic regression analyses for men (n = 673) and women (n = 401). Approximately 19% of men and 37% of women had initiated and completed HPV vaccination. Several factors among men (i.e., older age, Latinx ethnicity, San Jose or St. Louis residence compared with New York City, never having had sex, and not previously being tested for STIs) and women (i.e., lower education level, San Jose or Houston residence compared with New York City, and never having had sex) were associated with lower odds of HPV vaccination initiation, completion, or both. Gay men had higher odds of initiating and completing the vaccination series than their heterosexual counterparts. Our findings reveal that HPV vaccination uptake is low among YEH and that there are vaccination disparities among subgroups of YEH. HPV vaccination strategies and resources that are easy-to-understand, facilitate point-of-care services, and address societal and system-level vaccination barriers encountered by YEH are needed.

AB  - The effects of a resilience enhancement programme on resilience, depression, anxiety, and problem drinking among female runaway youths living in shelters were evaluated. Participants were 32 youths (16 experimental and 16 control participants), assessed at pre-test, post-test, and one-month follow-up. The programme incorporated five protective factors associated with resilience: self-esteem, self-regulation, relational skills, problem-solving skills, and goal-setting skills. There were significant group-by-time interaction effects for resilience, anxiety, and problem drinking at one-month follow-up. The preliminary results suggest that providing female runaway youths with this programme focusing on protective factors may enhance resilience and mitigate anxiety, and problem drinking.

AB  - Background: Food security status has been assessed as a representative score for households; however, different members in the same household may perceive and report food insecurity differently. A high prevalence of food insecurity has been reported among Latino households, therefore understanding differences in reporting food insecurity by Latino father-mother dyads may improve accuracy of assessment and plans to address food insecurity. This study aimed to 1) determine demographic characteristics and/or food-related factors associated with perceptions of food security status among Latino father-mother dyads, and 2) identify factors associated with discordance in perceptions of food insecurity between dyads.Methods: Baseline data were used from a community-based, youth obesity prevention program among Latino families (n = 106 father-mother dyads). Food security was assessed with a 2-item food insecurity screen. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between reporting food security status and predictor variables for fathers, mothers, and dyad-discordant responses.Results: Food insecurity was reported by 39% of fathers and 55% of mothers. Adjusted odds of reporting food insecurity were significantly higher for fathers perceiving their neighborhood was unsafe vs. safe (OR: 3.7, p < 0.05) and reporting lower vs. higher household income (OR: 3.2, p < 0.05). Adjusted odds of reporting food insecurity were significantly higher for mothers perceiving their neighborhood was unsafe vs. safe (OR: 4.1, p < 0.01) and reporting lower vs. higher home availability of fruit and vegetable (OR: 5.5, p < 0.01). Dyad discordance in reporting food security status occurred in 24% of the dyads. Adjusted odds of dyad discordant reports of food insecurity status were significantly higher for dyads reporting discordant responses regarding previous nutrition education (OR: 3.4, p < 0.05) and higher home fruit and vegetable accessibility (OR: 3.1, p < 0.05) compared to dyads reporting concordant responses. Among the 28 dyads who reported discordant nutrition education participation, 21 reported that fathers had never participated but mothers had participated more than once.Conclusions: Differential factors were associated with reporting food security among Latino father-mother dyads. Nutrition education for fathers that improves awareness of home food supplies and a better understanding of how food accessibility influences maternal perceptions may improve dyad discordance in reporting household food security.

AB  - Virtual reality perspective-taking (VRPT) experiences effectively increase both empathy and prosocial behaviors toward related social targets (e.g., cutting down a tree in virtual reality increases concern for the environment). This project tests the prediction that empathy is analogous to a muscle that increases with practice and can transfer to unrelated contexts instead of being a mental state that increases only for a specific context or target. This study examines the extent to which VRPT experiences can train empathic skills that are applied to unrelated social targets and contexts. Two thirds of the participants engaged in VRPT experiences either showing what it is like to become homeless or how ocean acidification affects the marine environment. A third of the participants were in the control condition and did not complete a VRPT task. Results replicate previous findings showing that VRPT tasks increase related context empathy and prosocial behaviors; however, the results on VRPTs effect on empathy and prosocial behaviors for unrelated contexts were mixed. The VRPT ocean acidification task was more effective at inducing empathy for the homeless, an unrelated social target, than the control condition, but the empathy-transfer effect did not occur from the homeless context to the ocean context. Replicating previous work, participants who experienced what it is like to become homeless signed a petition supporting the homeless at significantly higher rates than participants in the control condition. These findings show that transfer of empathy from one context to another is possible, but this transfer does not occur for all contexts.

AB  - Introduction: Changes in motor control are the first that may appear, compromising individual development and the learning of motor skills. Objective: Verifying and comparing development and motor control of children and teenagers institutionalized in shelters with those who live in a family environment. Methods: It has been evaluated 54 children and teenagers divided into Shelter Group (SG) and Control Group (CG). The evaluation of psychomotor development has been done by Psychomotor Battery; motor control, by the computational task Fitts Reciprocal Aiming Task v.1.0 (Horizontal). Results: Lower SG scores have been found in motor development analysis; however, both groups have been presented "good" profiles. In addition, it has been found a considerable increase in the movement from ID2 to ID4a with maintenance from ID4a to ID4b, and from ID4b to ID6. Conclusion: SG individuals presented appropriate psychomotor development according to their age with deficit in the motor control and longer movement time in relation to the CG, showing bigger difficulty in the speed.
AB  - Introdução: Alterações no controle motor são as primeiras que podem aparecer, comprometendo a aprendizagem de habilidades motoras e o desenvolvimento do indivíduo. Objetivo: Verificar e comparar o desenvolvimento e o controle motor de crianças e adolescentes institucionalizados em abrigos com aqueles que convivem em ambiente familiar. Métodos: Foram avaliados 54 crianças e adolescentes, divididos em Grupo Abrigo (GA) e Grupo Controle (GC). A avaliação do desenvolvimento psicomotor foi feita pela Bateria Psicomotora; o controle motor, pela tarefa computacional Fitts Reciprocal Aiming Task v.1.0 (Horizontal). Resultados: Na análise do desenvolvimento motor, foram encontradas pontuações inferiores do GA, porém, ambos os grupos apresentaram perfis "bons". Além disso, foi encontrado aumento significante do tempo de movimento de ID2 para ID4a, com manutenção do ID4a para ID4b, e ID4b para ID6. Conclusão: Os indivíduos do GA apresentaram desenvolvimento psicomotor adequado para a idade, com deficit no controle motor, e maior tempo de movimento em relação ao GC, demostrando maior dificuldade na velocidade.

AB  - Purpose: This randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy between the Social Enterprise Intervention (SEI) and Individual Placement and Support (IPS) with homeless youth with mental illness to assess their impact on nonvocational outcomes. Method: Seventy-two homeless youth were recruited from one agency and randomized to the SEI (n = 36) or IPS (n = 36) conditions. Over 20 months, SEI participants received four SEI components, and IPS participants received eight IPS components. Data were collected on mental health, housing, and social support outcomes at baseline and one follow-up period. Results: Findings from mixed analysis of variance indicate that both SEI and IPS participants displayed statistically significant changes in their self-esteem, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) problems, inattention problems, living in a shelter, and living in a private residence. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate the comparative efficacy and short-term nonvocational outcomes of SEI and IPS with homeless youth with mental illness. Assessment of long-term outcomes of both interventions is warranted.

AB  - Homeless youth frequently experience victimization, and youth with histories of trauma often fail to detect danger risks, making them vulnerable to subsequent victimization. The current study describes a pilot test of a skills-based intervention designed to improve risk detection among homeless youth through focusing attention to internal, interpersonal, and environmental cues. Youth aged 18 to 21 years (N = 74) were recruited from a shelter and randomly assigned to receive usual case management services or usual services plus a 3-day manualized risk detection intervention. Pretest and posttest interviews assessed youths’ risk detection abilities through vignettes describing risky situations and asking youth to identify risk cues present. Separate 2 (intervention vs. control) × 2 (pretest vs. posttest) mixed ANOVAs found significant interaction effects, as intervention youth significantly improved in overall risk detection compared with control youth. Post hoc subgroup analyses found the intervention had a greater effect for youth without previous experiences of indirect victimization than those with previous indirect victimization experiences.

AB  - Background Homeless young people are recognized as a very vulnerable group in terms of mental health; however, few studies in the UK have examined this. Furthermore, homeless young people represent a heterogeneous group in terms of their mental health and greater characterization could improve intervention work. Objectives The aims of this study were to examine prevalence and subtypes of psychopathology among a British sample of young homeless people and to investigate potential associations between identified typologies and a priori specified current and past experiences. In addition, the study intended to explore physical health, mental health, and housing outcomes for the different mental health subgroups. Design A prospective longitudinal design was used. Methods Structured interviews including a mental health assessment were conducted with 90 young homeless people aged 16-23 years. Follow-up interviews were conducted approximately 10 and 20 months later. Cluster analysis at baseline was used to identify groups based on lifetime mental health problems. Results The current and lifetime incidence of mental health problems was high (88% and 93%, respectively). Three subgroups of homeless young people were identified: (1) minimal mental health issues; (2) mood, substance, and conduct disorder; and (3) post-traumatic stress disorder, mood, and anxiety issues. These groups differed with respect to follow-up indicators of change and stability of mental health status, service use, and suicide risk, but not housing outcome. Other characteristics (gender ratio, past experiences) also distinguished the subgroups. Conclusions Typologies of young homeless people based on psychopathology reveal differences in lifetime and future experiences including mental health at follow-up. Identified groups could be used to tailor interventions towards differing needs. Practitioner points Low mood, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and psychosis are common mental health issues among young homeless people in the UK., Subgroups of young homeless people with differing needs can be identified, and these groups can be used to predict outcomes., Tailoring support provision towards specific needs has the potential to improve mental health and other outcomes for vulnerable young homeless people., Young homeless people often do not access the support to which they are entitled. Services need to be adapted to improve access for this group.

AB  - Background: In several EU countries, synthetic cathinone (SC) use has spread among injecting drug users (IDUs); it has been linked to risk of dependence and HIV/HCV transmission. Aims: To analyze the association between dependence and risky injecting practice with experimental and repeated SC use in the past 12 months among the clients of needle-syringe programs in the Czech Republic. Methods: IDUs in six locations in the Czech Republic were surveyed in 2013 and 2014 (n= 463). Single-predictor multinomial logit models were run to determine SC use upon the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) and risky injecting practice; the same predictors were included in the multivariate model with confounders. Findings: SDS score and risky injecting practice were significantly associated with repeated SC use in single-predictor models but not in the multivariate model; SC experimentation was linked to young and male respondents and those who lived in a larger city (>50,000); predictors of repeated SC use were homelessness (AOR = 3.2), co-occurring use of stimulants and opioids (AOR = 4.3), and use of cannabis (AOR = 2.4) in the past month. Conclusions: Repeated SC use was associated with poly-drug use and homelessness; given the rather inferior status of SCs among IDUs, their users face a risk of stigmatization and further marginalization.

AB  - Background: Youth often experience unique pathways into homelessness, such as family conflict, child abuse and neglect. Most research has focused on adult homeless populations, yet youth have specific needs that require adapted interventions. This review aims to synthesize evidence on interventions for youth and assess their impacts on health, social, and equity outcomes.Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and other databases from inception until February 9, 2018 for systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials on youth interventions conducted in high income countries. We screened title and abstract and full text for inclusion, and data extraction were completed in duplicate, following the PRISMA-E (equity) review approach.Results: Our search identified 11,936 records. Four systematic reviews and 18 articles on randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Many studies reported on interventions including individual and family therapies, skill-building, case management, and structural interventions. Cognitive behavioural therapy led to improvements in depression and substance use, and studies of three family-based therapies reported decreases in substance use. Housing first, a structural intervention, led to improvements in housing stability. Many interventions showed inconsistent results compared to services as usual or other interventions, but often led to improvements over time in both the intervention and comparison group. The equity analysis showed that equity variables were inconsistently measured, but there was data to suggest differential outcomes based upon gender and ethnicity.Conclusions: This review identified a variety of interventions for youth experiencing homelessness. Promising interventions include cognitive behavioural therapy for addressing depression, family-based therapy for substance use outcomes, and housing programs for housing stability. Youth pathways are often unique and thus prevention and treatment may benefit from a tailored and flexible approach.

AB  - Background: There is limited experimental evidence on transitional care interventions beyond 30 days post-discharge and in vulnerable populations.Objective: Evaluate effects of a transitional care practice (TC) that comprehensively addresses patients' medical and psychosocial needs following hospital discharge.Design: Pragmatic, randomized comparative effectiveness trial.Patients: Adults discharged from an initial emergency, observation, or inpatient hospital encounter with no trusted usual source of care.Interventions: TC intervention included a scheduled post-discharge appointment at the TC practice, where a multidisciplinary team comprehensively assessed patients' medical and psychosocial needs, addressed modifiable barriers, and subsequent linkage to a new primary care source. Routine Care involved assistance scheduling a post-discharge appointment with a primary care provider that often partnered with the hospital where the initial encounter occurred.Main Measures: The primary outcome was a binary indicator of death or additional hospital encounters within 90 days of initial discharge. Secondary outcomes included any additional hospital encounters, and counts of hospital encounters, over 180 days.Key Results: Four hundred ninety patients were randomized to TC intervention and 164 to Routine Care; 34.6% were uninsured, 49.7% had Medicaid, and 57.4% were homeless or lived in a high-poverty area. There was no significant difference between arms in the 90-day probability of death or additional hospital encounters (relative risk [RR] 0.89; 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-1.13). However, TC patients had 37% and 35% lower probability of any inpatient admission over 90 days (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.43-0.91) and 180 days (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.47-0.89), respectively. Over 180 days, TC patients had 42% fewer inpatient admissions (incidence rate ratio 0.58; 95% CI 0.37-0.90).Conclusions: Among patients randomized to a patient-centered transitional care intervention, there was no significant reduction in 90-day probability of death or additional hospital encounters. However, there were significant decreases in measures of inpatient admissions over 180 days.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03066492.

AB  - The federal government enacted the McKinney--Vento Homeless Assistance Act (MVA) to equip schools with services to help alleviate the many barriers students experiencing homelessness face in pursuit of educational opportunities. Educational agencies use federally man- dated liaisons to uphold the provisions of the MVA. Despite the homeless liaisons' importance in facilitating the policy, few studies have examined how liaisons perceive their service area' s response to homelessness. This study explored homeless liaisons' perceptions of MVA implementation in their service areas. Researchers invited every homeless liaison in three southern states to complete an online survey focusing on perceptions of MVA implementation and their service area' s response to homelessness. Of the 369 practitioners identified as a homeless liaison solicited for study participation, 32 percent completed surveys. Results indicated significant differences in perceived implementation in the level of collaboration with teachers and school administrators, liaisons' job titles, school' s receipt of federal Education for Homeless Children and Youth funding, and awareness of homelessness in terms of general awareness, interaction, policy, and needs. Findings indicate that collaboration and awareness are major factors that affect perceptions of implementation. Furthermore, the results indicate that liaisons must take steps to ensure a collaborative environment to implement the MVA.

AB  - Background: Obesity leads to serious health consequences in children and is potentially associated with increased adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Nationally representative studies examining associations between obesity and ACEs are lacking. Therefore, we aimed to determine the relationship between ACEs and childhood obesity. Methods: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of children 10–17 years of age, who participated in the 2018 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), a national population-based survey. Obesity was determined by CDC definitions using BMI calculated by the NSCH from self-reported height/weight. Logistic regression, adjusted for key sociodemographic factors, determined differences in rates of ACEs between children with obesity (BMI ≥95th percentile) and those without (BMI <95th percentile). Results: Weighted NSCH data included 29,696,808 children 10–17 years of age, 15% with obesity. Obesity was associated with having more ACEs compared to other children (p < 0.01). In adjusted analyses, children with obesity were more likely than other children to report most ACEs, including food/housing insecurity [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.64, confidence interval (95% CI) 1.26–2.13], parental divorce [1.67 (1.32–2.13)], witnessing physical violence [1.49 (1.03–2.16)], be a victim of violence [1.99, (1.27–3.12)], or live with a person with drug/alcohol abuse [1.65, (1.24–2.2)]. Children with obesity were also more likely to report ≥4 ACEs compared to other children (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Children with obesity are more likely to report ACEs overall and have more ACEs compared to other children. Obesity negatively affects child health; in combination with ACEs, health outcomes of children may be disproportionately affected, highlighting the importance of preventive screening and social interventions in childhood.

AB  - Background: Veterans experiencing housing instability are at increased risk of suicide. Research is needed to identify gender differences in the predictors of both suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, particularly among Veterans who are unstably housed.Objectives: The objective of the present study was to explore whether correlates of suicide-related morbidity among unstably housed Veterans vary by gender and identify implications for improved care for these Veterans.Methods: The study cohort included 86,325 Veterans who reported current housing instability between October 1, 2013, and September 30, 2016. This cross-sectional study assessed differences in demographic and outcome variables by gender using χ2 analyses and a series of multiple logistic regressions predicting suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, stratified by gender.Results: Among unstably housed female Veterans, being younger than 40 years was associated with more than double the odds of having an indicator of suicidal ideation and >12 times the odds of having an indicator of a suicide attempt. The effect sizes associated with age were much less pronounced among unstably housed male Veterans. The presence of mental health and substance use conditions as well as a positive screen for military sexual trauma were associated with increased risk of suicide morbidity among both women and men.Conclusions: Intervention and prevention among unstably housed Veterans may be complicated by unpredictable living situations; further research should explore tailored interventions to address the complex needs of unstably housed Veterans and how suicide prevention can be woven throughout.

AB  - Background: Individuals often report concurrent social risk factors such as food insecurity, unstable housing, and transportation barriers. Comparing relative changes between pairs of social risk factors may identify those that are more resistant to change.Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a method to describe relative changes in pairs of social risk factors.Research Design: This was a prospective cohort study.Subjects: Participants in a randomized controlled trial of hypertension care in an Urban Indian Health Organization.Measures: We measured 7 social risk factors (housing, transportation, food, clothing, health care, utilities, and debts) at enrollment, 6, and 12 months among 295 participants in the trial. We hypothesized that pairwise comparisons could identify social risk factors that were less likely to change over time. We used conditional odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to rank each pair.Results: Food, clothing, health care, utilities, and debts had more changes between 0 and 6 months relative to housing (OR=2.3, 3.4, 4.7, 3.5, and 3.4, respectively; all 95% CI excluded 1.0). These same social risk factors also had more changes between baseline and 6 months relative to transportation (OR=2.8, 3.4, 4.9, 4.7, and 4.1, respectively; all 95% CI excluded 1.0). Changes in housing and transportation risk factors were comparable (OR=0.7, 95% CI: 0.4-1.4). Relative changes between 6 and 12 months were similar.Conclusions: Housing and transportation exhibited fewer relative changes than other social risk factors and might be more resistant to change. Awareness of the relationships between social risk factors can help define priorities for intervention.

AB  - Continued substance use is common during opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment. There are still inconsistencies in how continued substance use and concurrent patterns of substance use among patients with OUD varies by gender. There is still more to learn regarding how factors associated with continued and concurrent use might differ for men and women in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). Methods: This cross-sectional study examined predictors of concurrent substance use subgroups among patients receiving MMT. The sample included 341 (n = 161 women) MMT patients aged 18 and older from opioid treatment programs in Southern New England and the Pacific Northwest. Patients completed a survey assessing sociodemographic and clinical characteristics including past-month substance use. Latent class analyses were conducted by gender to identify groups based on substance use and determine predictors of those classes. Results: Three-class solutions were the optimal fit for both men and women. For both genders, the first subgroup was characterized as Unlikely Users (59.8% women, 52.8% men). Classes 2 and 3 among women were Cannabis/Opioid Users (23.7%) and Stimulant/Opioid Users (13.0%). Among men, Classes 2 and 3 consisted of Alcohol/Cannabis Users (21.9%) and Cannabis/Stimulant/Opioid Users (25.3%). Ever using Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone) and depression/anxiety symptoms were significantly linked to substance use group among women, whereas homelessness and employment status were significantly associated with substance use group among men. Conclusions: This study furthers understanding of gender differences in factors associated with continued substance use and distinctive patterns of concurrent substance use that may guide tailored treatments among patients MMT.

AB  - This study was designed to address the need for more detailed information about Indigenous homeless youth, a group overrepresented in the homeless population, using a national-level data set. The study used a cross-sectional, self-report survey design. Surveys were used to gather demographic, mental health, and quality of life data from a sample of 1103 Canadian youth accessing homeless services with data collected in 2015. This article focused on the 332 Indigenous respondents, using both comparisons with non-Indigenous youth and within-group comparisons across key domains. These findings suggested greater mental health and addiction challenges among Indigenous homeless youth compared with non-Indigenous respondents as well as evidence of a more problematic role of child protection. Within-group comparisons suggested that female and sexual and gender minority youth are particularly at risk among Indigenous youth with some added child protection and justice implications for reserve-raised youth. Child protection history and street-victimization were particularly relevant to the current distress levels. Overall, such findings reinforce calls for Indigenous-specific interventions for these populations—including policy-driven prevention initiatives to address the legacy of colonization. • Indigenous homeless youth are at greater risk than non-Indigenous homeless youth. • Victimization and distress are particularly high among female and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queen, two spirit youth. • Child protection involvement is strongly associated with risk in this population. • Policy imperatives include child protection policy and culture-specific intervention.

AB  - Objective: to investigate how Nursing care occurs in the face of the condition related to the gestational period in the context of a situation of social vulnerability of the street. Method: a descriptive study with a qualitative approach, carried out on the streets of the city of Maceió (AL), Brazil, where activities are carried out by the Teams of the Street Doctor's Office (SDO), linked to Basic Health Care. Results: nine pregnant women (N = 9) in a situation of vulnerability, attended by the teams of SDO, through an instrument model used to collect data, considering prenatal care. The presentation of the data is characterized in thematic units that translate identifications of the guidelines for their risk condition during the gestational period. Conclusion: reception and attention based on harm reduction, for the implementation of prenatal care assistance strategies, present good prognosis in the context experienced. Thus, it is possible to maintain the bond of trust between pregnant women in social street vulnerability and nursing team in carrying out an ethical work and in an attempt to minimize the irreversible risks to the health of the mother and the gestation in life.

AB  - This study provides information on how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is affecting emerging adults currently or recently homeless in terms of engagement in protective behaviors, mental health, substance use, and access to services. Ninety participants in an ongoing clinical trial of a risk reduction program for homeless, aged 18–25 years, were administered items about COVID-19 between April 10 and July 9, 2020. Most participants reported engaging in COVID-19 protective behaviors. Past week mental health symptoms were reported by 38%–48% of participants, depending on symptoms. Among those who used substances before the outbreak, 16%–28% reported increased use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. More than half of the participants reported increased difficulty meeting basic needs (e.g., food), and approximately 32%–44% reported more difficulty getting behavioral health services since the outbreak. Innovative strategies are needed to address the increased behavioral health needs of young people experiencing homelessness during events such as the COVID-19 outbreak.

AB  - Key Points: Question: Are social determinants of health (SDOHs), extracted from both structured and unstructured clinical data, associated with an increased risk of suicide death among US veterans? Findings: In this case-control study of 8821 cases and 35 284 matched controls, SDOHs from both structured data and unstructured data (extracted using a natural language processing system) were associated with an increased risk of suicide death. Meaning: The findings of this study suggest that SDOHs are risk factors for suicide among the US veterans and that natural language processing can be leveraged to extract SDOH information from unstructured data. This case-control study assesses suicide risk among veterans by social determinants of health (SDOHs) identified using both structured data and unstructured data in the electronic health record extracted using natural language processing. Importance: Social determinants of health (SDOHs) are known to be associated with increased risk of suicidal behaviors, but few studies use SDOHs from unstructured electronic health record notes. Objective: To investigate associations between veterans' death by suicide and recent SDOHs, identified using structured and unstructured data. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nested case-control study included veterans who received care under the US Veterans Health Administration from October 1, 2010, to September 30, 2015. A natural language processing (NLP) system was developed to extract SDOHs from unstructured clinical notes. Structured data yielded 6 SDOHs (ie, social or familial problems, employment or financial problems, housing instability, legal problems, violence, and nonspecific psychosocial needs), NLP on unstructured data yielded 8 SDOHs (social isolation, job or financial insecurity, housing instability, legal problems, barriers to care, violence, transition of care, and food insecurity), and combining them yielded 9 SDOHs. Data were analyzed in May 2022. Exposures: Occurrence of SDOHs over a maximum span of 2 years compared with no occurrence of SDOH. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cases of suicide death were matched with 4 controls on birth year, cohort entry date, sex, and duration of follow-up. Suicide was ascertained by National Death Index, and patients were followed up for up to 2 years after cohort entry with a study end date of September 30, 2015. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs were estimated using conditional logistic regression. Results: Of 6 122 785 veterans, 8821 committed suicide during 23 725 382 person-years of follow-up (incidence rate 37.18 per 100 000 person-years). These 8821 veterans were matched with 35 284 control participants. The cohort was mostly male (42 540 [96.45%]) and White (34 930 [79.20%]), with 6227 (14.12%) Black veterans. The mean (SD) age was 58.64 (17.41) years. Across the 5 common SDOHs, NLP-extracted SDOH, on average, retained 49.92% of structured SDOHs and covered 80.03% of all SDOH occurrences. SDOHs, obtained by structured data and/or NLP, were significantly associated with increased risk of suicide. The 3 SDOHs with the largest effect sizes were legal problems (aOR, 2.66; 95% CI, 2.46-2.89), violence (aOR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.98-2.27), and nonspecific psychosocial needs (aOR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.92-2.23), when obtained by combining structured data and NLP. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, NLP-extracted SDOHs, with and without structured SDOHs, were associated with increased risk of suicide among veterans, suggesting the potential utility of NLP in public health studies.

AB  - While many studies provide useful information on the risk behaviors in which homeless youth engage, few prior studies evaluate Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) risk related reduction strategies. In this study, homeless youth (n = 180) were recruited from a drop-in center and randomly assigned to one of two conditions, either an integrated individual cognitive-behavioral treatment and HIV prevention intervention that focused on skills building and education or to treatment as usual. All youth were assessed at entry into the program and at 3 and 6 month follow-up points. Findings showed an interaction between treatment condition, age and time. In the interaction, youth assigned to the integrated treatment reported greater condom usage than youth assigned to treatment as usual, with younger youth assigned to treatment as usual showing no change in condom use. The number of sexual partners reported by youth in both treatment conditions was also reduced over time. However, youth in both conditions continued to engage in other high-risk behaviors. The integrated treatment findings are promising and suggest that interventions which target both HIV risk behavior in addition to other life areas (substance use, mental health and housing) among homeless youth may be necessary in order to significantly impact high-risk behaviors among this unique group.

AB  - • First peer reviewed systematic review on independent living programs and services effectiveness in Canada and U.S. since 2011. • Majority of programs and services are not producing the intended outcomes, with limited to no impact demonstrated on youth leaving care wellbeing outcomes. • Some of the studies found a negative impact, especially related to social support. • Compared to the U.S., program impact studies in Canada are sorely lacking; more research needs to be done in this area to build our knowledge of evidence-based and best practices. Evidence from American and Canadian studies over the last three decades demonstrates that youth exiting foster care are at a much higher risk to face a multiplicity of challenges than their peers who are not in care. These challenges result in negative outcomes, such as high rates of homelessness, under-education, unemployment or under-employment, poverty, mental health issues and post-traumatic stress, substance abuse and early pregnancy or parenthood. This systematic review addresses Independent Living Program (ILP) and Independent Living Services (ILS) studies in the U.S. and Canada published between 2000 and 2018. In order to compile a list of relevant ILP and ILS impact studies, a bibliographic search of six databases was conducted for the peer-reviewed literature, and the grey literature was searched using Google and expert consultation. The search yielded a total of 64 studies after applying our study selection protocol, with 50 from the peer review literature and 14 from the grey literature. The clear majority of studies originated from the U.S., with only three Canadian studies emerging from the grey literature. This is most likely due to differences in mandated data collection and reporting. In the U.S., data collection and reporting is mandatory under the Foster Care Independence Act in 1999. In Canada, there is no such mandatory reporting as child welfare services are under the sole jurisdiction of the provinces, with no Federal government involvement aside from First Nations children and youth. Studies to date suggest that ILP and ILS are not producing the intended outcomes, with limited to no impact demonstrated on youth leaving care wellbeing outcomes. In fact, some of the studies found a negative impact, especially related to social support. Much of the ILP and ILS studies did not incorporate the voices of youth in care, but rather focused on program process and components, staff experiences, and outcome measures such as social support, employment, income, housing and self-sufficiency. Of the limited ILP and ILS studies incorporating youth perspectives, youth in care often indicated that emotional support and mentoring are crucial needs during the transition to adulthood, which are often not the focus of ILP or ILS. Moreover, compared to the U.S., program impact studies in Canada are sorely lacking; more research needs to be done in this area to build our knowledge of evidence-based and best practices. This systematic review highlights two main conclusions: (1) Both the U.S. and Canada sorely need innovation with respect to preparing youth in care for the transition to adulthood; and (2) We also must commit to using rigorous research designs with such programming to determine the impact of such new approaches. In sum, we must reconceptualize our investment in youth in care and focus on their interdependence in order to realize their potential. This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

AB  - Background and Aims Smoking prevalence among homeless adults is exceedingly high, and high rates of comorbid substance use are among the barriers to abstinence experienced by this group. The extent to which smoking cessation might engender an escalation in comorbid substance use could be a concern prohibiting treatment provision and engagement. This study examined whether smoking abstinence status was associated with alcohol and substance use at 26 weeks post-randomization among homeless smokers in a smoking cessation trial. Design The current study was a secondary analysis of randomized smoking cessation intervention trial data. Setting The parent study was conducted in the Minneapolis/ St Paul area of Minnesota, USA. Participants Participants were 427 homeless adult smokers interested in quitting smoking. Measurements Covariates collected at baseline included alcohol, cocaine, marijuana/hashish, heroin and 'any' drug use, age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, tobacco dependence, length of time homeless and treatment group. Biochemically verified smoking abstinence and self-reported alcohol and substance use were collected at 26 weeks post-randomization. Findings Smoking abstinence was associated with fewer drinking days ( P = 0.03), fewer drinks consumed on drinking days ( P = 0.01), and lower odds of heavy drinking ( P = 0.05), but not with differences in the number of days of cocaine, marijuana/hashish, heroin or any drug use. Conclusions In homeless smokers, achieving smoking abstinence may be associated with a reduction in alcohol consumption but appears not to be associated with a substantial change in other drug use.

AB  - • The problem of girls running away from home is a social challenge that needs to be tackled. • This phenomenon is worrying for families, practitioners, and governments. • Runaway behavior in adolescent girls is predicted by low family cohesion in Jeddah. • There are socio-demographic characteristics that apparently contribute to runaway behavior. The phenomenon of girls running away from home is an increasingly widespread social challenge confronted by families, welfare agencies, and governmental organizations in Jeddah, Saudia Arabia. This study compared runaway girls and a control group on various measures and investigated the predictors of runaway behavior among Saudi adolescent girls. A sample of young adolescent girls (N = 77, aged between 14 and 21 years) included a purposive sample of runaways (N = 33), comprised of all the girls living in a social care home in Jeddah who had left their homes at least once, and a control group (N = 44) selected via cluster sampling. The participants were assessed using a demographic questionnaire, the Family Cohesion Scale, and the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction Scale. Inter-group differences were apparent and differences were also found based on the circumplex model. The results of the stepwise discriminant analysis showed six variables (family cohesion, age, education, number of sisters, number of brothers, and birth order) that remained and explained 80.82% of group membership variation. Lack of family cohesion, along with several demographic variables, can lead to complicated emotional attitudes among adolescent girls which trigger runaway behavior. Although runaway youth services must continue to stay focused on safety and short-term residential care, the underlying causal factors must be identified as well.

AB  - The United States is facing a growing homelessness crisis. We characterize the demographics and outcomes of homeless patients who sustain burn injury and compare them to a cohort of domiciled patients. A retrospective cohort study was performed at the Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Regional Burn Center for consecutive acute burn admissions in adults from June 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018. Patients were categorized as either domiciled or homeless at the time of their injury. Prevalence rates were estimated using data from the regional homeless count. From 881 admissions, 751 (85%) had stable housing and 130 (15%) were homeless. The rate of burn injury requiring hospitalization for homeless adults was estimated at 88 per 100,000 persons. Homeless patients had a significantly larger median burn size (7 vs 5%, P < .05) and a greater rate of flame burns (68 vs 42%, P < .001). For the homeless, rates of assault and self-inflicted injury were 4- (18 vs 4%, P < .001) and 2-fold higher (9 vs 4%, P < .001), respectively. Homeless patients had higher rates of mental illness (32 vs 12%, P < .001) and substance abuse (88 vs 22%, P < .001), and were less likely to follow-up as outpatients (54 vs 87%, P < .001). There was no difference in mortality. Homeless patients had a longer median length of stay (LOS; 11 vs 7 days, P < .001) without significant differences in LOS per percentage TBSA. Homeless individuals should be considered a high-risk population for burn injury. This distinction serves as a call to action for the development of burn prevention strategies.

AB  - The current study identified subgroups of homeless youth and young adults that exhibited distinct co-occurring patterns of substance use and social stability (e.g., employment, school attendance, and housing), and evaluated the relative effectiveness of the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA), Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), and case management (CM) in interrupting substance use and improving social stability. The differentiating effects of personal characteristics on the co-occurrence of substance use and social stability were also examined. Participants included 270 homeless youth and young adults who were randomly assigned to one of the three intervention conditions: CRA, n = 93, MET, n = 86, or CM, n = 91. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months postbaseline. A dual trajectory latent class growth analysis identified four co-occurring patterns: low-stable substance use paired with low-increasing social stability, high-stable substance use paired with low-stable social stability, high-declining substance use paired with low-increasing social stability, and low-increasing substance use paired with high-stable social stability. Findings showed that CRA was superior in improving substance use and social stability simultaneously compared to MET and CM, and further, CM was more effective than MET. Personal factors including race, age, coping strategies, and behavior problems differentiated the co-occurring patterns of substance use and social stability. The findings underscore the significance in identifying subgroups of homeless youth that vary in problem severity in terms of their substance use and social stability, and offer evidence to help practitioners identify the most effective intervention that responds to the needs of homeless youth.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to describe differences in health care utilization between homeless and nonhomeless minors with diabetes.Research Design and Methods: Data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's Statewide Inpatient Database from New York for years 2009-2014 were examined to identify pediatric patients <18 years old with diabetes. Outcomes of interest included hospitalization rate, in-hospital mortality, admission through the emergency department (ED), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hospitalization cost, and length of stay (LOS). Other variables of interest included age-group, race/ethnicity, insurance type, and year. Multivariate logistic regression models were used for in-hospital mortality, admission through ED, and DKA. Log-transformed linear regression models were used for hospitalization cost, and negative binomial regression models were used for LOS.Results: A total of 643 homeless and 10,559 nonhomeless patients were identified. The hospitalization rate was higher among homeless minors, with 3.64 per 1,000 homeless population compared with 0.38 per 1,000 in the nonhomeless population. A statistically significant higher readmission rate was detected among homeless minors (20.4% among homeless and 14.1% among nonhomeless, P < 0.01). Lower rates of DKA (odds ratio 0.75, P = 0.02), lower hospitalization costs (point estimate 0.88, P < 0.01), and longer LOS (incidence rate ratio 1.20, P < 0.01) were detected among homeless minors compared with nonhomeless minors.Conclusions: This study found that among minors with diabetes, those who are homeless experience a higher hospitalization rate than the nonhomeless. Housing instability, among other environmental factors, may be targeted for intervention to improve health outcomes.

AB  - Purpose To explore the factors that differentiate trafficked homeless youth from not-trafficked homeless youth. Methods From November 2015–February 2017, homeless youth served by Covenant House New Jersey, aged 18–22, received a trafficking assessment. Youth were stratified based upon trafficking experience, and their responses to demographic and social history questions were examined for association with trafficking occurrence. Results Of 344 participants, 9.6% had a trafficking experience. Having an Individualized Education Program/504 plan was, for the first time in anti-trafficking literature, associated with a trafficking experience in bivariable analysis. IEP/504 plans are developed for school-aged children whose ability to succeed in traditional educational formats is challenged by learning, social, or functional problems. In the multivariable analysis, a history of arrest was associated with being trafficked while the presence of a supportive adult was associated with not being trafficked. Gender was not associated with a trafficking experience. Conclusions This study is the largest to specifically assess homeless youth's demographic and social variables for association with trafficking experience. Homeless youth who are and are not trafficked share similar life experiences, but those with a supportive adult in their life had lower odds of being trafficked. Building upon our research, future investigations exploring order of occurrence will elucidate the risk factors for and protective factors against trafficking among homeless youth, contributing to evidence-based prevention efforts.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this secondary analysis of data from an ongoing, longitudinal intervention study for homeless youths (ages 18–24 years) was threefold: (1) to differentiate by age, sex, and sexual orientation, the positive attributes of hope, optimism, resilience, future time perspective, and gratitude, (2) to determine how these positive attributes might be related to life satisfaction, and (3) to determine which set of variables might best explain life satisfaction. We found a statistically significant difference in resilience scores by sex, H(2) = 6.591, p =. 037, with males scoring higher than females. None of the other positive attributes differed significantly by sex. Future time perspective (FTP) differed significantly by sexual orientation with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth scoring higher than others on FTP (p =.046). All theoretical variables (hope, optimism, FTP, resilience, and gratitude) were significantly related to life satisfaction (p <.01). After controlling for all other variables, hope and gratitude significantly explained variance in life satisfaction (p <.001). This analysis supports the claim that despite their vulnerabilities and limitations, homeless youths have many positive attributes that are related to their life satisfaction. It may be that future interventions focused on positive attributes of hope and gratitude can be developed to further enhance psychological capital and contribute to life satisfaction among these young people. Highlights • Males' resilience scores were higher than questioning, uncertain, or other (M = 125.77 v. 73.39; p =.024). • LGBT future time perspective scores higher than questioning, uncertain, or other (M = 126.54 v. 84.66; p =.046). • Hope, optimism, future time perspective, resilience, gratitude all significantly related to life satisfaction (p <.01). • Hope, gratitude, optimism significantly explained life satisfaction, controlling for all other variables (p <.001).

AB  - Cognitive impairments are common in homeless youth and negatively impact academic and vocational outcomes. We examined the feasibility and efficacy of cognitive interventions provided to 18- to 22-year-old homeless youth living in urban supportive housing. Ninety-one homeless youth were randomized to receive either targeted cognitive training (cognitive remediation) or general cognitive activation (computer skills training). Cognitive and psychological outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 13 and 26 sessions, and 1 month postintervention. A high dropout rate highlighted the feasibility challenges of treating this population. Intent-to-treat analysis found significant improvements across groups in specific and global measures of cognition and psychological distress, with no significant group differences. Transition-age homeless youth show improvements in cognitive and psychological functioning when engaged in interventions that address their cognitive development. This speaks to the malleability of cognitive skills in this cohort and lays the groundwork for future research to address their cognitive health.

AB  - • Housing and supportive services improved young homeless mothers' behavioral health. • Only housing and supportive services improved sexual minority mothers' outcomes. • Supportive services are critical for homeless sexual minority mothers' unique needs. Sexual minority (SM) youth have twice the risk of experiencing homelessness compared to their heterosexual peers. Further, SM youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) report greater depression symptoms and substance use compared to heterosexual YEH. Housing First is an intervention that provides scattered-site individual apartments, without any prerequisite conditions for eligibility, and additional services to support long-term housing sustainment; however, few studies have examined the effectiveness of this approach for SM youth. The current study utilized data from a RCT that provided housing to young mothers experiencing homelessness to examine if treatment effects varied by mothers' sexual identity. Mothers were randomly assigned to services as usual (i.e., provided a referral sheet of all services available in the community; SAU), Housing only (i.e., three months of utility and rental assistance; Housing), or housing and supportive services (integrates independent housing, Strengths-Based Outreach and Advocacy (SBOA), HIV prevention, and substance use/mental health counseling; Housing + SS). Latent growth curve models were estimated to assess how substance use and depression symptoms changed over the 12 months. SM mothers receiving SAU or Housing did not experience a significant change in substance use or depression symptoms. All groups of heterosexual mothers and SM mothers receiving Housing + SS had less substance use and depression symptoms at twelve months, with SM mothers in Housing + SS evidencing a steeper decline in substance use and depression symptoms. This study provides some of the first evidence that Housing First can mitigate the mental health and substance use concerns of SM YEH. Given SM's higher rates of homelessness, substance use, and depression symptoms, Housing First should be further explored as an intervention to address their unique needs.

AB  - Mortality among drug users based upon routes of administration (ROA) is less studied. We examined deaths by ROA, and association between ROA and all-cause deaths. Data of 2766 primary users of opiates and stimulants who sought treatment in Helsinki, Finland, from 1997 to 2008 were linked to the national cause-of-death register. Cox regression models were used to compute adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for all-cause deaths, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). There were statistically significant differences in all-cause deaths by ROA reported at baseline interview (p= 0.012): 12.7% (n= 251/1976) among intravenous (IV) drug users, 11.5% (n= 27/235) among oral users, 7.9% (n= 12/152) among smokers, 6.9% (n= 19/276) among snorters, and 16.5% (n= 21/127) among those with unspecified ROA. IV users died more from accidental overdose relative to other specified routes (p= 0.036). All nine HIV and all three hepatitis C deaths occurred among IV users. The hazard for all-cause death was lower among smokers compared to IV users (aHR: 0.52 (95%CI: 0.28–0.97) after adjusting for gender, homelessness, drug use behaviours, and psychiatric comorbidities present at baseline. Deaths occurred in all groups: drug users in general need to be educated that no route of drug administration is harmless. Preventive and intervention measures should target all ROA.

AB  - Purpose: Virtually nothing is known about the potential effects of tobacco advertising on tobacco use among youth experiencing homelessness, a vulnerable population with high tobacco use rates. This study examines associations between the appeal of advertising for 5 classes of tobacco product (electronic cigarettes, hookah, cigars, cigarillos, and smokeless tobacco) and future intentions to use those products again among homeless youth who had indicated any level of lifetime use.Design: A cross-sectional design was used.Setting: Settings were 25 service and street sites in Los Angeles County.Participants: A probability sample of 469 young tobacco users experiencing homelessness (mean age = 22; 71% male; 29% non-Hispanic White) was recruited.Measures: Assessments included product-specific tobacco advertising appeal and future intentions to use the product again, as well as a range of covariate controls (eg, demographics, homelessness severity, current tobacco use, general advertising exposure).Analysis: Linear regression tested for associations between the appeal of advertising for a specific tobacco product and intentions to use that product again in the future, controlling for myriad covariates.Results: Advertising appeal was positively associated with future intentions to use again for electronic cigarettes (P = .006) and hookah (P = .001), but not cigars (P = .486), cigarillos (P = .126), or smokeless tobacco (P = .109).Conclusion: Results suggest that advertising appeal may increase use of certain tobacco products among youth experiencing homelessness. However, differences in themes emphasized by advertising for specific tobacco products could differentially influence use in this population.

AB  - Background: Homeless individuals suffer a greater burden of health problems than the general population. This study aimed to describe the epidemiology of physical trauma among homeless patients presenting to an urban major trauma center and to ascertain any differences in the nature, injury severity and outcomes among homeless compared to domiciled patients.Methods: A retrospective matched cohort study that included adults who met inclusion criteria for The Alfred Hospital Trauma Registry between 01 July 2010 and 31 March 2017 was conducted. Primary homelessness was identified using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision Coding Z59.0 and/or 'No fixed abode' address data. Homeless and domiciled patients were matched at a 1:2 ratio on age, sex, month and year of injury. The primary outcome variable was the Injury Severity Score (ISS). Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS), mortality, emergency department (ED) disposition, hospital disposition, discharge processes and trauma registry recidivism.Results: Of 25,920 cases in the trauma registry, 147 (0.6%) were identified as homeless, comprising 131 unique homeless individuals who were matched with 262 domiciled patients. The median (Inter-Quartile Range) ISS among homeless patients was 5(2-10), compared to 9(4-17) for domiciled patients (p < 0.001). Homeless patients had significantly lower odds of sustaining an injury with ISS>12 (OR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.8, p = 0.001). Homeless patients were treated more often than domiciled patients for assault (32.1% vs 9.5%), intentional self-harm (10.7% vs 2.7%), and penetrating injury (16.0% vs 6.5%). Homeless patients had higher rates of psychiatry admissions (9.2% vs 0.8%), positive blood alcohol concentration (30.5% vs 13.7%), and higher odds of discharging against medical advice (DAMA)(OR 2.0, 95% CI: 1.1-3.6 p = 0.02). There were no differences in LOS (p = 0.51), mortality (p = 0.19), ED disposition (p = 0.64) or trauma registry recidivism (p = 0.09).Conclusion: Among injured patients who presented at an urban trauma center, homelessness was associated with higher odds of assault, intentional self-harm, penetrating injury, psychiatry admissions, DAMA but lower ISS than domiciled patients. Variable definitions of homelessness and lack of standardized documentation in the medical record should be addressed to ensure these vulnerable patients are identified and linked with peripheral services.

AB  - Background: Directly observed treatment (DOT) has been the standard of care for tuberculosis since the early 1990s, but it is inconvenient for patients and service providers. Video-observed therapy (VOT) has been conditionally recommended by WHO as an alternative to DOT. We tested whether levels of treatment observation were improved with VOT.Methods: We did a multicentre, analyst-blinded, randomised controlled superiority trial in 22 clinics in England (UK). Eligible participants were patients aged at least 16 years with active pulmonary or non-pulmonary tuberculosis who were eligible for DOT according to local guidance. Exclusion criteria included patients who did not have access to charging a smartphone. We randomly assigned participants to either VOT (daily remote observation using a smartphone app) or DOT (observations done three to five times per week in the home, community, or clinic settings). Randomisation was done by the SealedEnvelope service using minimisation. DOT involved treatment observation by a health-care or lay worker, with any remaining daily doses self-administered. VOT was provided by a centralised service in London. Patients were trained to record and send videos of every dose ingested 7 days per week using a smartphone app. Trained treatment observers viewed these videos through a password-protected website. Patients were also encouraged to report adverse drug events on the videos. Smartphones and data plans were provided free of charge by study investigators. DOT or VOT observation records were completed by observers until treatment or study end. The primary outcome was completion of 80% or more scheduled treatment observations over the first 2 months following enrolment. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and restricted (including only patients completing at least 1 week of observation on allocated arm) analyses were done. Superiority was determined by a 15% difference in the proportion of patients with the primary outcome (60% vs 75%). This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number registry, number ISRCTN26184967.Findings: Between Sept 1, 2014, and Oct 1, 2016, we randomly assigned 226 patients; 112 to VOT and 114 to DOT. Overall, 131 (58%) patients had a history of homelessness, imprisonment, drug use, alcohol problems or mental health problems. In the ITT analysis, 78 (70%) of 112 patients on VOT achieved ≥80% scheduled observations successfully completed during the first 2 months compared with 35 (31%) of 114 on DOT (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 5·48, 95% CI 3·10-9·68; p<0·0001). In the restricted analysis, 78 (77%) of 101 patients on VOT achieved the primary outcome compared with 35 (63%) of 56 on DOT (adjusted OR 2·52; 95% CI 1·17-5·54; p=0·017). Stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting were the most common adverse events reported (in 16 [14%] of 112 on VOT and nine [8%] of 114 on DOT).Interpretation: VOT was a more effective approach to observation of tuberculosis treatment than DOT. VOT is likely to be preferable to DOT for many patients across a broad range of settings, providing a more acceptable, effective, and cheaper option for supervision of daily and multiple daily doses than DOT.Funding: National Institute for Health Research.

AB  - Background: People experiencing homelessness have higher rates of HIV than those who are stably housed. Mental health needs, substance use problems, and issues unique to homelessness such as lack of shelter and transiency need to be considered with regard to HIV prevention. To date, HIV prevention interventions for young adults experiencing homelessness have not specifically addressed modifiable real-time factors such as stress, sexual or drug use urge, or substance use, or been delivered at the time of heightened risk. Real-time, personalized HIV prevention messages may reduce HIV risk behaviors.Objective: This pilot study tested the initial efficacy of an innovative, smartphone-based, just-in-time adaptive intervention that assessed predictors of HIV risk behaviors in real time and automatically provided behavioral feedback and goal attainment information.Methods: A randomized attention control design was used among young adults experiencing homelessness, aged 18-25 years, recruited from shelters and drop-in centers in May 2019. Participants were randomized to either a control or an intervention group. The intervention (called MY-RID [Motivating Youth to Reduce Infection and Disconnection]) consisted of brief messages delivered via smartphone over 6 weeks in response to preidentified predictors that were assessed using ecological momentary assessments. Bayesian hierarchical regression models were used to assess intervention effects on sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, and their corresponding urges.Results: Participants (N=97) were predominantly youth (mean age 21.2, SD 2.1 years) who identified as heterosexual (n=51, 52%), male (n=56, 57%), and African American (n=56, 57%). Reports of sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, stress, and all urges (ie, sexual, drug, alcohol) reduced over time in both groups. Daily drug use reduced by a factor of 13.8 times over 6 weeks in the intervention group relative to the control group (Multimedia Appendix 4). Lower urges for sex were found in the intervention group relative to the control group over the duration of the study. Finally, there was a statistically significant reduction in reports of feeling stressed the day before between the intervention and control conditions (P=.03).Conclusions: Findings indicate promising intervention effects on drug use, stress, and urges for sex in a hard-to-reach, high-risk population. The MY-RID intervention should be further tested in a larger randomized controlled trial to further investigate its efficacy and impact on sexual risk behaviors.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03911024; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03911024.

AB  - The link between youth homelessness and mental health functioning was examined using state population-representative 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data. The moderating role of victimization and perceived teacher support also was examined. Consistent with hypotheses, results indicated that homelessness was associated with greater mental health challenges, more victimization, and less teacher support. The association between homelessness and mental health was not moderated by perceived teacher support. However, victimization experiences served as a moderator such that more victimization exacerbated the effect of homelessness on mental health challenges. This study supports the utility of the YRBS for gaining understanding of the experiences and needs of youth experiencing homelessness and adds to the growing literature on predictors of individual differences in mental health functioning of these vulnerable youth.

AB  - Background: Malnutrition and infection are major barriers to educational access and achievement in low-income countries and also work in conjunction with each other in deteriorating wellness and productivity of school adolescents.Methods: A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of school-based nutrition education using a peer-led approach, health promotion through school media and health clubs. Data were collected at baseline, midline and end line from sampled participants. To account for the effect of time trend, the difference was measured using a repeated measure analysis. Variables that have p≤0.25 in the bivariate analyses were entered into multivariables to determine the independent effect of interventions.Results: There is a significant difference in food variety between food secure and insecure households (p<0.01). A significant improvement of animal source dietary intake was observed among intervention schools (p<0.001) that was significantly associated with an intervention [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.26, confidence interval (CI): 0.16, 0.42], male gender (AOR=0.48, CI: 0.31, 0.73) and household economic status (AOR=1.69, CI: 1.01, 2.84). The control group had high body mass index (BMI) at baseline, but a significant improvement was observed among the intervention schools, which positively associated with male gender (AOR=4.13, CI: 2.38, 7.15) and having a middle-income family (AOR=2.93, CI: 1.92, 6.15).Conclusion: This study showed that by integrating a dietary intervention into school-based activities, there might be significant improvements in dietary intake of primary school adolescents. Therefore, school-based nutrition education programs should be a part of comprehensive school health programs to reach the students and potentially their families.

AB  - Little is known about how the use of supplementary foods in the management of children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) is perceived by mothers, as well as the barriers they face while using it in Uganda. This study determined maternal perceptions and barriers experienced during the management of children aged 6 to 23 months diagnosed with MAM using either a malted sorghum‐based porridge (MSBP) or fortified corn soy blend (CSB+) as a supplementary porridge. Twelve focus groups and 48 in‐depth interviews were conducted among purposively sampled mothers a week after completing a 3‐month cluster randomised control trial with the two supplementary porridges for the management of their children with MAM in a rural setting of Arua district. All mothers who participated in the trial were eligible for inclusion. Mothers perceived both supplementary porridges as contributing towards weight gain, reducing the prevalence of illness, improving appetite, a healthy skin and improving active play. Barriers to using the supplementary porridges were a lack of time for feeding children due to household chores, maternal hunger as a result of household food insecurity and a lack of social household and community support. Therefore, maternal barriers should be addressed in an attempt to reap maximum benefits from supplementary food interventions for the management of children with MAM, by sensitising household members to the time required to conduct household chores and measure to address food insecurity.

AB  - Abstract Rates of shelter use among young adults (ages 18–24) experiencing homelessness are disproportionally low, compared to youth or older adults experiencing homelessness. The high unsheltered rate exposes these young adults to significant short- and long-term risks, while shelter use is associated with positive and improved outcomes, including increased access to other supportive services. Few studies have focused on factors related to low rates of shelter use among young adults or on the relative importance of such factors. The present study examines a series of background and contextual factors that are associated with shelter use among young adults experiencing homelessness. Using survey data (n = 338) collected in Houston, Texas, this study employs multiple logistic regression to examine correlates of shelter use and to assess the relative importance of each factor. Results indicate several significant characteristics were positively associated with shelter use, including being female, being non-white, using other types of services, and Internet use. We highlight research, practice, and policy implications around understanding differences in shelter and drop-in center use and ensuring young adults can find and access shelters with services geared toward their age group. Highlights • The study examines correlates of shelter use among homeless young adults. • Female and non-white young adults are more likely to use shelters. • Drop-in center use is significantly and negatively related to shelter use. • Internet use increases the odds of using a shelter.

AB  - Objective:How social support (SS) affects the odds of suicide attempt among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth in New Mexico and is modified by school location and metropolitan status.Methods:Multiple logistic regression for complex design was used to produce the adjusted odds of suicide attempt by SS using the New Mexico Youth Risk and Resiliency Survey (NM-YRRS) for 2011 (n = 2,730), 2013 (n = 3,171), and 2015 (n = 2,604) while adjusting for age, grade, gender, and maternal education level. Primary outcome: [Formula: see text]one self-reported suicide attempt in the past 12 months. Primary exposure: social support, categorized as low, moderate, and high support. Additional analysis on the 2015 NM-YRRS to understand how SS and the odds of suicide attempt were modified by (a) school location and (b) metropolitan status while adjusting for age, grade, gender, maternal education level, urbanicity, reservation status, unstable housing, forced sexual intercourse, and teen dating violence (n = 1,373).Results:The adjusted odds of suicide attempt among AI/AN students with low support compared to those with high support has declined from 2011 to 2015 (AOR= 5.5, 95% CI 3.3-9.6, in 2011; AOR= 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.7, in 2015). Low SS is a significant risk factor for rural/on reservation students. In contrast, low SS was not a risk factor for AI/AN students who attended schools in urban counties.Conclusion:Results address a gap in current research regarding differences in urban/rural AI/AN youth. In addition to SS, this study indicates there are unknown risk factors that drive suicide attempt for AI/AN youth in off reservation/urban schools.

AB  - • Students experiencing homelessness are more likely to display risky sexual behavior. • Student homelessness was associated with increased likelihood of STI/HIV testing. • These links were not moderated by student sex or LGB identity. • Asian students experiencing homelessness are at high risk for risky sexual behavior. Teens who experience homelessness are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior, though less is reliably known about sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing rates in this group. We tested for differences in sexual behaviors and STI/HIV testing based on student homelessness and intersecting factors using data from the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey administered in 7 states and 3 school districts. Students who experienced homelessness were more likely to report risky sexual behavior. Race moderated this link, suggesting that Asian students who experienced homelessness were at greater risk. Homelessness was linked to a greater likelihood of having been tested for STIs/HIV among those who seemed to be in groups recommended for testing. Student sex and lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) identity did not moderate associations between homelessness and risky sexual behavior or STI/HIV testing. The overall sample demonstrated low STI testing rates, indicating a continued need to improve testing rates for all youth at risk for STIs/HIV.

AB  - Food insecurity in Australia is increasing. Organisations within the charitable food sector aim to manage, and in some cases are implementing strategies to prevent, food insecurity, such as food literacy programmes. This pilot study describes the challenges and opportunities for evaluating the impact of a food literacy programme , FoodMate by SecondBite ™, which aims to reduce food insecurity amongst 'at risk' young people. Three community agencies working with 'at risk' young people delivered an 8-week food literacy programme in Melbourne, Australia. A pre-test/post-test design was used and outcome measures included: (i) food intake, (ii) diet quality, (iii) cooking confidence and (iv) food independence. These were assessed via questionnaires and 24-hour recalls at three time points: pre-programme (T1), post-programme (T2) and at 4 to 6-week follow-up (T3). Twenty-one young people aged 16-25 years participated in this pilot study. The response rate for the questionnaire and 24-hour recalls declined across the study: T1 ( n = 21), T2 ( n = 11) and T3 ( n = 9). Some positive effects were associated with the programme but attrition rates were high and the majority of participants did not complete all measures. Although results were inconclusive, this study describes some common challenges of conducting a food literacy intervention with vulnerable young people and highlights the benefit of nutrition researchers and practitioners working together to conduct evaluation of such programmes.

AB  - Background: Opportunities for meaningful engagement with the homeless can alter negative attitudes. The purpose of this study was to assess changes in attitudes towards the homeless among undergraduate nursing students participating in a service‐learning foot soak experience. Methods: This was a prospective, pretest and posttest interventional study. Student attitudes were measured through: (a) the attitudes toward homelessness inventory and (b) thematic analysis of a guided reflection on the experience. Results: Mean posttest total scores (mean = 50.06; standard deviation = 7.004) were significantly (P =.001) higher from mean pretest scores (mean = 47.06; standard deviation = 5.455), indicating more positive attitudes towards the homeless (n = 47) after the clinic. Three categories of themes that reflected student experiences are as follows: (a) benefits, (b) context, and, (c) potential consequences. Conclusions: A foot soak clinic can increase students' understanding of experiences faced by homeless persons through genuine human interaction, and has benefits to community members and learners.

AB  - Background: Homeless female ex-offenders (homeless female offenders) exiting jail and prison are at a critical juncture during reentry and transitioning into the community setting. Objective: The purpose of the study was to compare the effect of a dialectical behavioral therapy-case management (DBT-CM) program with a health promotion (HP) program on achieving drug and alcohol abstinence among female parolees/probationers residing in the community. Methods: We conducted a multicenter parallel randomized controlled trial with 130 female parolees/probationers (aged 19-64 years) residing in the community randomly assigned to either DBT-CM (n = 65) or HP (n = 65). The trial was conducted in four community-based partner sites in Los Angeles and Pomona, California, from February 2015 to November 2016. Treatment assignment was carried out using a computer-based urn randomization program. The primary outcome was drug and alcohol use abstinence at 6-month follow up. Results: Analysis was based on data from 116 participants with complete outcome data. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that the DBT-CM program remained an independent positive predictor of decrease in drug use among the DBT-CM participants at 6 months (p = .01) as compared with the HP program participants. Being non-White (p < .05) and having higher depressive symptom scores (p < .05) were associated with lower odds of drug use abstinence (i.e., increased the odds of drug use) at 6 months. Discussion: DBT-CM increased drug and alcohol abstinence at 6-month follow-up, compared to an HP program.

AB  - Background:Homeless young adults are more likely than their never-homeless counterparts to abuse alcohol and engage in risky sexual behaviors, yet no interventions to simultaneously reduce both these behaviors among this vulnerable population have been systematically designed and evaluated. We therefore developed a brief intervention (BI) to reduce both alcohol use and sexual risk behaviors among homeless young adults. The results of a randomized trial testing the BI against an education comparison (EC) are presented. Method:Young adults (N = 61; age 17–22 years) from an urban, Northeastern crisis shelter were randomly assigned to either the two-session, individual-level BI or a time-matched, two-session, individual-level EC. Generalized linear mixed models for repeated measures determined effects of treatment condition on outcomes. Results:The BI significantly increased participant readiness to change alcohol use. However, it did not significantly decrease primary alcohol or HIV sexual risk outcomes, independently or relative to EC (allps > 0.05). Participants in the EC reduced times engaged in unprotected sex between baseline and post-intervention to a significantly greater extent (p < 0.01) than those in the BI condition. Participants in both conditions reported satisfaction with respective interventions. Conclusions:Findings suggest that the BI was acceptable and successful in getting participants to consider changing their drinking. However, lack of change in alcohol and sexual behavior outcomes indicates the need for further research to determine how to translate readiness to change into actual behavioral change among homeless young adults.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between cognitive coping strategies and the experience of autonomy, competence, relatedness and quality of life in homeless young adults. The sample consisted of 251 young adults (age 18 to 25) who had just entered a Dutch shelter facility. In addition, moderating effects of cognitive coping in the relationship between life stressors and the outcomes were examined. The analyses were conducted by means of linear regression. Our results indicated that adaptive cognitive coping strategies were related to the constructs of self-determination. Both adaptive and maladaptive cognitive coping strategies were related to quality of life. Positive reappraisal and positive refocusing moderated the relationship between life stressors and the outcomes. The implications of interventions will be discussed. Registration Dutch trial register (registration number NTR3254), (http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3254). Highlights • Adaptive cognitive coping is related to self-determination in homeless young adults. • Adaptive and maladaptive cognitive coping is related to quality of life. • Positive reappraisal and positive refocusing buffer against stressors.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Asthma is widely prevalent among US children, particularly in homeless children, who often lack proper medication storage or the ability to avoid environmental triggers. In this study, we assess asthma-attributed health care use among homeless youth. We hypothesize that asthma hospitalization rates, symptom severity, and admission through the emergency department (ED) will be higher among homeless youth compared with nonhomeless youth. METHODS: This secondary data analysis identified homeless and nonhomeless pediatric patients (<18 years old) with a primary diagnosis of asthma from New York statewide inpatient databases between 2009 and 2014. Hospitalization rate, readmission rate, admission through the ED, ventilation use, ICU admittance, hospitalization cost, and length of stay were measured. RESULTS: We identified 71 837 asthma hospitalizations, yielding 73.8 and 2.3 hospitalizations per 1000 homeless and nonhomeless children, respectively. Hospitalization rates varied by nonhomeless income quartile, with low-income children experiencing higher rates (5.4) of hospitalization. Readmissions accounted for 16.0% of homeless and 12.5% of nonhomeless hospitalizations. Compared with nonhomeless patients, homeless patients were more likely to be admitted from the ED (odds ratio 1.96; 95% confidence interval: 1.82-2.12; P < .01), and among patients >5 years old, homeless patients were more likely to receive ventilation (odds ratio 1.45; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-2.09; P = .04). No significant differences were observed in ICU admittance, cost, or length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Homeless youth experience an asthma hospitalization rate 31 times higher than nonhomeless youth, with higher rates of readmission. Homeless youth live under uniquely challenging circumstances. Tailored asthma control strategies and educational intervention could greatly reduce hospitalizations.

AB  - Runaway adolescents often have strained relationships with their parents. Given parental support is an important protective resource for traumatized young people, understanding differences in support within parent–adolescent relationships could aid in designing more effective interventions. We hypothesized (1) runaway adolescents seen at a Child Advocacy Center (CAC) would have poorer parental relationships than adolescents without a history of running away and (2) severity of diagnosed sexual violence would be associated with lower parental connectedness. Data were from 2,042 adolescents aged 10–19 years and their parents evaluated for any reason at our hospital-based CAC from 2008 to 2017. Parent–adolescent relationship scales were completed by adolescents and at least one parent/guardian (usually mothers). Sexual abuse was stratified at four levels, higher levels indicating increasingly severe forms of abuse. T-tests and analyses of variance to tested relationships between supportive and controlling parental behaviors by runaway status, and, among runaways, by the severity of sexual abuse. Runaway adolescents comprised 58.3% of adolescents seen at the CAC; runaways reported lower parental support and higher parental controlling than patients without a history of running away. Those with the most severe forms of sexual abuse (including sexual exploitation and gang rape) reported the least supportive and most controlling relationships with parents, as did their parents. Findings support our clinical observations that polyvictimization of adolescents who have spent significant time as runaways may further strain parent–adolescent relationships. Future clinical research should focus on developing interventions to promote parental connectedness after a runaway episode.

AB  - In an essay in Critical Social Work, Robert Fairbanks suggests that space perspectives need to be accounted for in social work practice if the profession is to procure a more nuanced understanding of the production of social relationships. Yet, Fairbanks s analysis fails to account for the problematic of a spatialised politics of belonging for racialised subjects, and for the connections between racialising practices and (neo)liberal governance on localized social-spatial relations. This paper addresses these shortcoming by accomplishing three objectives: (1) To introduce a renewed vector of space thesis by borrowing from post-colonial writings; (2) To enliven that frame by critically reading visual images produced within the context of social service agencies in Toronto. I examine how these images attempt to reorient codes of difference and belonging in relationship to the representational and material contexts in which they were produced; and (3) To provoke a Social Work response to its own animation of these theoretical precepts. I argue that client produced representations reposition a practice sight-line away from a positioning of client subjectivity as redeemable only in it s neo-liberal guise or as surplus in its democratic value, towards one that allows for an inter-subjective unfolding of identity, place and belonging.

AB  - Independent eating occasions (iEOs) among adolescents were associated with poorer diet quality and overweight status in previous studies. Little is known about how iEOs (frequency and food groups/food types consumed) vary by personal (e.g., age, sex, race, ethnicity) and household (e.g., food security) characteristics and other factors (e.g., school learning format - online vs. remote). To determine associations among iEOs (frequency and food groups/food types consumed) and key personal and household characteristics among low-income adolescents in the US. A US-based online cross-sectional survey was administered to a national sample of low-income adolescents who reported iEOs and their parents (n = 622 dyads) from Qualtrics survey panelists (November/December 2021). About half were 11-12 years (44%), boys (53%), non-Hispanic White (44%), and from food-insecure households (52%). About two-thirds (68%) reported attending school in person. An adapted 27-item FLASHE (Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, Eating) Study food frequency questionnaire was used to quantify mean daily intake frequencies of food groups/types consumed overall and during iEOs. Chi-square tests were used to compare iEO frequency by demographic characteristics. Linear regression analyses were used to determine associations among mean iEO and overall daily food group intake frequencies (dependent variables) and iEO frequency (independent variable) adjusting for demographic and household characteristics. Frequency of iEOs was ≤ 3-4 times/week (46%) and ≥ 5-6 times/week (54%), with no differences by age group, sex, or in-person school attendance. Frequency of IEOs was positively associated with intake frequencies for all food groups both during IEOs and overall. Higher daily iEO intake frequencies of sugar-sweetened beverages, fast food/convenience foods, and all detrimental foods were also associated with food insecurity and non-Hispanic White race. More frequent iEOs were associated with greater daily intake frequency of less healthful and healthful foods during iEOs and overall. Nutrition education could focus on increasing intake of healthful foods during iEOs for food-insecure youth. USDA

AB  - Background: To achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 3, which is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all persons of all ages, street-involved young people (SIYP) must be assured of universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare. This study aims to determine the factors associated with age- and sex-specific differences in the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) behaviour of SIYP in southwest Nigeria. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study that recruited 1505 SIYP aged 10–24 years by use of respondent-driven and time-location sampling. Data were collected through interviewer-administered questionnaires on socioeconomic characteristics; access to SRH information; contraceptive knowledge and use; sexual behavior; and sexual practice. The outcome variables were inconsistent condom use, multiple sexual partners, and transactional sex. Binomial regression analysis models were developed to determine risk indicators for outcome variables. Results: Although 968 (64.3%) participants were sexually active and 1089 (72.4%) knew about modern contraception, only 300 (31.0%) sexually active respondents used modern contraceptives. Knowledge of modern contraception (AOR: 0.11; 95% C.I: 0.01–0.82, p = 0.03) and being employed (AOR: 0.38; 95% C.I: 0.15–0.95, p = 0.04) reduced the odds for inconsistent condom use among male SIYPs. For female SIYPs, knowledge of modern contraception reduced the odds for inconsistent condom use (AOR: 0.26; 95% C.I: 0.08–0.90, p = 0.03), whereas access to SRH information significantly increased the odds for inconsistent condom use (AOR: 5.06; 95% C.I: 1.67–15.37, p = 0.004). Conclusion: Age- and sex- related factors associated with risky sexual behaviors vary among SIYP. Addressing these differences in the delivery of targeted interventions to reduce sexual health risk of SIYP may be required.

AB  - Background: Our aim was to design a valid and reliable consumer quality index (CQI) specifically suited to assess the experiences that homeless people, homeless youth, and abused women have with shelter and community care services. Methods: A pilot CQI questionnaire was constructed on the basis of literature study, focus group discussions with clients, concept mapping by clients and shelter workers, and a pre-pilot study. The pilot questionnaire was completed by 762 clients using shelter facilities for homeless people, homeless youth or abused women. Psychometric and multilevel analyses were performed to optimize the instrument and determine its validity, reliability and discriminative power. Results: The preparatory research had revealed seven primary focus topics, all of which were incorporated into the pilot questionnaire. Psychometric analyses resulted in four reliable scales, one of which applied only to clients in residential, day or night shelter programs. The final instrument consisted of 42 items for community care clients and 52 for clients using residential facilities, and day and night shelters; 32 and 42 such items pertained to client experiences. Conclusion: The consumer quality index for shelter and community care services (CQI-SCCS) is a valid, reliable instrument for assessing the quality of these services. It provides guidance to facilities in quality maintenance and improvement, and it is useful in determining quality differences in facilities for homeless people and homeless youth.

AB  - Introduction: Several studies have reported pronounced racial/ethnic differences in smoking behavior among homeless youth. Better understanding the factors underlying racial/ethnic differences in daily smoking among homeless youth may help inform programs to reduce smoking in this population.Methods: Data come from a probability sample of homeless youth in Los Angeles County collected between 2008 and 2009. The sample includes 116 African American, 99 Hispanic, and 119 White youth with ages ranging from 13 to 24 years. Chi-square tests were used to test the differences in daily smoking among African American, Hispanic, and White youth. Propensity score and doubly robust methods were used to produce a less biased estimate of the association between daily smoking and race/ethnicity after having removed the effect of potential confounders.Results: The daily smoking rate for White youth was 70.1%, more than 31 percentage points than the rates for either African American or Hispanic youth. Propensity score analysis revealed that the majority of the racial/ethnic differences in smoking rates could be explained by differences in homelessness severity, although background characteristics and comorbidity were relevant as well.Conclusions: As programs are developed to reduce smoking among homeless youth, results suggest that additional outreach may be needed to engage White youth in services. Also, smoking prevention programs may benefit from incorporating a social network-based approach that assists youth in fostering relationships with lower-risk peers, as well as addressing other forms of substance use. Incorporating these elements may help reduce the large racial/ethnic disparities in daily smoking among homeless youth.Implications: This report extends the small existing literature on racial/ethnic differences in smoking among homeless youth in two important respects. First, it confirms differences in daily smoking, an important indicator of dependence, across racial/ethnic groups. Second, it seeks to understand the extent to which differences in smoking can be explained by demographic characteristics (other than race/ethnicity), background factors, homelessness severity, and comorbidity characteristics known to be associated with substance use among homeless youth.

AB  - Background: Four decades of population-based tobacco control strategies have contributed to substantial reduction in smoking prevalence in Australia. However, smoking prevalence is still double in socially disadvantaged groups compared to those that are not. But not all tobacco control strategies successfully used in the general population is effective in specific high-risk population groups. Hence, an effective way to reduce smoking in high risk population groups may include targeting them specifically to identify and support smokers to quit. In this backdrop, we examined whether tobacco control interventions at the population-level are more effective in increasing life expectancy among Australians compared to interventions targeting a high risk group or a combination of the two when smoking prevalence is reduced to 10 and 0% respectively.Methods: Using the risk percentiles approach, analyses were performed separately for men and women using data from various sources such as the 2014-15 National Health Survey linked to death registry, simulated data for high risk groups, and the Australian population and deaths data from the census. Indigenous status was simulated by preferentially assigning those who are indigenous to lower SES quintiles. The age-sex distribution of mental disorder status was simulated using its distribution from 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey with 25.9% of mentally ill being assigned to current smoking category and the rest to non-smoking category. The age-sex distribution of prisoners was simulated based on 2014 ABS Prisoners Australia survey with 74% of prisoners being assigned to current smoker category and the rest to non-smoker category. Homelessness status was simulated according to age, sex and indigenous status for 2011 census with all homeless being allocated to the lowest SES category. The age-sex distribution of total cholesterol level was simulated based on 2011-13 Australian Health Survey.Results: The results showed that the combined approach for reducing smoking is most effective for improving life expectancy of Australians particularly for the socially disadvantaged and mentally ill groups both of which have high fraction of smokers in the population. For those who were mentally ill the gain in ALE due to reduction of smoking to 10% was 0.53 years for males and 0.36 years for females which were around 51 and 42% respectively of the maximal gains in ALE that could be achieved through complete cessation.Conclusions: Targeting high-risk population groups having substantial fraction of smokers in the population can strongly complement the existing population-based smoking reduction strategies. As population and high risk approaches are both important, the national prevention policies should make judicious use of both to maximize health gain.

AB  - Children of color are over-represented in the child welfare system. Research suggests that disproportionality is predominately attributable to the resource poor environments in which these children are raised. However, it is important to understand whether the child welfare system is able to diminish these societal level inequities, and consequently disproportionality, by reducing racial/ethnic disparities in outcomes of youth exiting state care. Encouragingly, research in this area has found few racial/ethnic differences in the outcomes of former foster youth. However, these studies are regional and have not investigated outcomes for a broad array of racial/ethnic groups. To fill this gap, the present study uses the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) to examine educational attainment, employment, homelessness, and incarceration for white, African-American, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native emancipated youth. Results reveal that African-American youth are less likely to be employed and more likely to report incarceration than white youth. However, African-American youth were 36% more likely to enroll in higher education than white youth and there were no significant differences in outcomes between white and Hispanic youth. However, AI/AN youth exhibited no advantages and significant disadvantages relative to youth from other racial/ethnic groups. Results suggest that child welfare services and state supports for youth exiting care can contribute to improved outcomes and racial/ethnic parity. However, additional effort is needed to reduce poor outcomes, particularly for American Indian/Alaska Native youth. • Researchers have found few racial/ethnic differences in foster youth outcomes. • Previous outcome research is regional with limited racial/ethnic comparisons. • There are no clear advantages among African-American, Hispanic, and white youth. • AI/AN have poorer outcomes relative to all other emancipated youth.

AB  - Objective: This study explored factors associated with attrition of vulnerable women from a community‐based, longitudinal mental health intervention study. Design: The study employed a quasi‐experimental, nonequivalent comparison group pretest–posttest design. The intervention consisted of six, 90‐min meetings featuring education and support. Sample: One hundred and eighteen women aged 18–88 years enrolled from four urban neighborhoods. Measurements: The team used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder‐7, the Primary Health Questionnaire‐9, a self‐care knowledge for anxiety and depression instrument, and demographics to measure variables. Intervention: Sessions occurred at trusted neighborhood sites. The team provided transportation, child care, and reminder calls or texts. Community health workers actively encouraged participants to continue in the study. The researchers did not offer financial incentives. Completion of the intervention involved attending four of six sessions. Results: The study had a 39% attrition rate. Results, using a Chi‐square test for independence, indicated significant associations between attrition, neighborhood/homelessness, and family income. Additionally, there were significant associations between attrition, a past diagnosis of anxiety, and a lack of concurrent therapy for anxiety/depression. Conclusions: This study identified social determinants and mental health factors linked to the attrition of urban, ethnically diverse, and impoverished women from longitudinal intervention studies.

AB  - Most of what we know about sexual abuse comes from efforts to examine female children victimized by men. Although some researchers have identified similarities between male and female victims of sexual abuse, few studies have examined gender-specific factors associated with sexual health practices among homeless adolescents. The aim of this study was to explore how gender and history of sexual abuse influence cognitive-perceptual and behavioral factors associated with sexual health practices of homeless adolescents. This study was a secondary analysis of data collected for a cross-sectional study of the sexual health practices of homeless adolescents. The sample consisted of 414 youths (104 males who reported sexual abuse and 124 who did not; and 95 females who reported sexual abuse and 75 who did not; 16 did not provide these data). Homeless adolescent females with a history of sexual abuse scored higher (indicating a shorter perspective) on a measure of future time perspective than females with no sexual abuse. Males who reported no sexual abuse scored higher than abused females on perceived health status and higher than abused males on assertive communication. With respect to perceived health status, males who reported no sexual abuse scored significantly higher than females who reported sexual abuse (p = .04). Males with no sexual abuse had significantly higher assertive communication scores than did males who had experienced sexual abuse (p = .015). We found that male and female abuse victims differ in terms of their cognitive-perceptual and behavioral factors associated with sexual health practices. Early identification of those who have been abused is critical so that interventions can be developed. Effective short-term interventions are needed for the adolescent victims of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA), particularly those who are homeless and prone to further sexual victimization.

AB  - Homeless young adults exhibit high rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and sexual risk behaviors. This study is a secondary analysis of data collected in a randomized clinical trial of AWARE, a new 4 session group motivational interviewing intervention. AWARE mainly focused on alcohol use and sexual risk behavior given focus group feedback. We used sequential coding to analyze how the group process affected both AOD use and sexual risk behavior at 3-month follow up among homeless young adults by examining facilitator behavior and participant change talk (CT) and sustain talk (ST). We analyzed 57 group session digital recordings of 100 youth (69% male, 74% heterosexual, 28% non-Hispanic white, 23% African American, 26% Hispanic, 23% multiracial/other; mean age 21.75). Outcomes included importance and readiness to change AOD use and risky sexual behavior, AOD use and consequences, number of partners and unprotected sex, and condom self-efficacy. Sequential analysis indicated that facilitator open-ended questions and reflections of CT increased Group CT. Group CT was associated with a lower likelihood of being a heavy drinker 3 months later; Group ST was associated with decreased readiness and confidence to change alcohol use. There were no associations with CT or ST for drug use or risky sexual behavior. Facilitator speech and peer responses were related to CT and ST during the group sessions with this high risk population, which were then associated with individual changes for alcohol use. Further research is needed to explore associations with drug use and sexual risk behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record

AB  - Background: Homeless youth are a population at risk for suicidal behavior. Despite growing knowledge about risk factors, protective factors against suicidal behavior among this population are still poorly understood. Aims: To explore differences in coping and social support between homeless adolescents who attempted suicide and those who did not. Method: In total, 76 homeless adolescents from eight different shelters provided information about their suicidal behaviors over the previous year and filled out coping and social support questionnaires. Results: Homeless adolescents who had not attempted suicide perceived more social support (tangible assistance and guidance). Conversely, youth who had attempted suicide reported using more nonproductive strategies of coping (tension reduction, keep to self, and self-blame). Tangible assistance and tension reduction were found to be the strongest predictors. Limitations: As most of these youth were not homeless for a long time, care should be taken in generalizing these results to adolescents with longer histories of homelessness. Conclusion: Productive coping does not seem to constitute a sufficient personal resource to protect homeless adolescents from suicide attempts. Nonproductive coping could, however, be considered a serious risk factor. Consequently, promoting homeless youths' ability to find environmental resources, especially tangible assistance, could be the most valuable approach.

AB  - Objective: To test the effectiveness of Houvast: a strengths-based intervention for homeless young adults. Method: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted with 10 Dutch shelter facilities randomly allocated to an intervention and a control group. Homeless young adults were interviewed when entering the facility and when care ended. Repeated-measures analyses and logistic regression analyses were conducted by the principle of intention-to-treat framework (N = 251). Results: Improvements were demonstrated on quality of life; satisfaction with family relations, finances, and health; employed or in school; depression; care needs; autonomy; competence, and resilience in both conditions. A higher proportion of homeless young adults who received care according to Houvast were still receiving care at follow-up and successfully completed the trajectory compared to those who received care as usual. Conclusion: Homeless young adults seem to benefit from service provision in general. Further research on the effectiveness of Houvast is needed after sufficient model fidelity has been achieved.

AB  - Objectives: The current study sought to test hard drug use outcomes for youth receiving a strengths-based outreach and advocacy intervention that linked youth to either a shelter or a drop-in center. Methods: Homeless youth (14–24 years old) were engaged by research assistants (RAs) at soup kitchens, parks, libraries, and other locations that homeless youth were known to frequent. Youth were randomly assigned to receive six months of advocacy that focused on linking youth to a drop-in center (n = 40) or to a crisis shelter (n = 39). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Hard drug use over time was the main outcome. Intervention condition and service connection were used as predictors for the baseline level and the slope of change in hard drug use over time. Data analysis was conducted with Bernoulli Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling in HLM7. Results: The current study found that those who were in the drop-in linkage condition exhibited a greater reduction in their odds of using hard drugs during the follow-up points than their counterparts in the shelter linkage condition. And finally, those who utilized services more often during the follow-ups were those who exhibited less hard drug use at baseline and less reduction in their odds of using hard drugs. Conclusions: This study suggests that drop-in centers, which are often characterized by low-demand programming and few behavioral restrictions, are effective for addressing hard drug use among homeless youth.

AB  - Importance: Previous studies have shown high mortality rates among homeless people in general, but little is known about the patterns of mortality among "rough sleepers," the subgroup of unsheltered urban homeless people who avoid emergency shelters and primarily sleep outside.Objectives: To assess the mortality rates and causes of death for a cohort of unsheltered homeless adults from Boston, Massachusetts.Design, Setting, and Participants: A 10-year prospective cohort study (2000-2009) of 445 unsheltered homeless adults in Boston, Massachusetts, who were seen during daytime street and overnight van clinical visits performed by the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program's Street Team during 2000. Data used to describe the unsheltered homeless cohort and to document causes of death were gathered from clinical encounters, medical records, the National Death Index, and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health death occurrence files. The study data set was linked to the death occurrence files by using a probabilistic record linkage program to confirm the deaths. Data analysis was performed from May 1, 2015, to September 6, 2016.Exposure: Being unsheltered in an urban setting.Main Outcomes and Measures: Age-standardized all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates and age-stratified incident rate ratios that were calculated for the unsheltered adult cohort using 2 comparison groups: the nonhomeless Massachusetts adult population and an adult homeless cohort from Boston who slept primarily in shelters.Results: Of 445 unsheltered adults in the study cohort, the mean (SD) age at enrollment was 44 (11.4) years, 299 participants (67.2%) were non-Hispanic white, and 72.4% were men. Among the 134 individuals who died, the mean (SD) age at death was 53 (11.4) years. The all-cause mortality rate for the unsheltered cohort was almost 10 times higher than that of the Massachusetts population (standardized mortality rate, 9.8; 95% CI, 8.2-11.5) and nearly 3 times higher than that of the adult homeless cohort (standardized mortality rate, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.3-3.2). Non-Hispanic black individuals had more than half the rate of death compared with non-Hispanic white individuals, with a rate ratio of 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.7; P < .001). The most common causes of death were noncommunicable diseases (eg, cancer and heart disease), alcohol use disorder, and chronic liver disease.Conclusions and Relevance: Mortality rates for unsheltered homeless adults in this study were higher than those for the Massachusetts adult population and a sheltered adult homeless cohort with equivalent services. This study suggests that this distinct subpopulation of homeless people merits special attention to meet their unique clinical and psychosocial needs.

AB  - Objective: Although youth homelessness presents a significant public health problem, the needs of homeless youths with mental illness, as distinct from adults, are not well understood. This study examined the unique demographic, clinical, and service use characteristics of homeless youths.Methods: At Home/Chez Soi was a large randomized controlled trial of the Housing First model in five cities in Canada. Of 2,255 participants, 7% (N=164) were youths ages 18 to 24. Youths were compared with older participants on baseline demographic, clinical, and service use characteristics.Results: More youths than adults had not finished high school (76% versus 54%), had a drug use disorder (66% versus 52%), and had been assaulted in the past six months (44% versus 36%) (all p<.05). Fewer than half the youths (49%) had a regular medical doctor, 50% reported unmet need for health care, and 61% visited an emergency department in the past six months.Conclusions: This sample of homeless youths with mental illness had low education, high rates of substance use disorders and victimization, and problems accessing services. These findings suggest that youths have trajectories to homelessness and service needs that are distinct from adults and may guide future planning for this vulnerable population.

AB  - Objectives To review empirical evaluations of individual-level interventions intended to improve mental health or well-being for vulnerable adolescents. Study design This is a systematic mapping review. Methods Thirteen databases covering academic and gray literature were searched for published reviews and randomised controlled trials, and gray literature (2005-2016) and the results quality-assessed to prioritise best available evidence. We aimed to identify well-conducted systematic reviews and trials that evaluated individual-level interventions, for mental health/well-being outcomes, where the population was adolescents aged 10-24 years in any of 12 vulnerable groups at high risk of poor health outcomes (e.g. homeless, offenders, 'looked after', carers). Results Thirty systematic reviews and 16 additional trials were identified. There was insufficient evidence to identify promising individual-level interventions that improve the mental health/well-being of any of the vulnerable groups. Conclusions Despite Western policy to promote health and well-being among vulnerable young people, the dearth of evidence suggests a lack of interest in evaluating interventions targeting these groups in respect of their mental health/well-being outcomes.

AB  - Follow-up rates reported among longitudinal studies that focus on runaway adolescents and their families are relatively low. Identifying factors associated with follow-up completion might be useful for improving follow-up rates and therefore study validity. The present study explored how individual- and family-level constructs, as well as research project activities, influence the follow-up completion rate among runaway adolescents ( N = 140) and their primary caregiver. Results showed that follow-up completion rates decreased as the number of research assistants (RA) assigned to each case increased and as participants' address changes increased. Additionally, among adolescents, more frequent alcohol use was associated with lower follow-up rates. The current findings suggest that researchers should (1) design their research so that one RA is assigned to each specific case, and (2) adjust their retention strategies to account for the differences in follow-up rates based upon the participants' drug of choice and residential stability.

AB  - This study explored the gender differences in sexual self-concept, personal resources for sexual health, safe sex behaviors, and risky sexual behaviors among homeless adolescents with and without histories of sexual abuse. Data for this secondary analysis were collected in 2003 to 2004 in the first phase of a larger repeated-measures sexual health intervention study; 371 homeless youth between 16 and 23 years of age (M = 19.26, SD = 1.83) were recruited from a street outreach center. The majority (64.6%) of participants were males. Self-report instruments were completed at the outreach center via audio computer-assisted self-interview (A-CASI) format. It was found that female participants were better off than males on numerous measures of sexual health behaviors and attitudes. Sexually abused participants had significantly less future time perspective (p = .05), fewer sexual self-care behaviors (p = .04), and less social support than nonabused participants (p = .01) and almost significantly more sexual risk-taking (p = .08). However, no significant differences were found between abused and nonabused participants on sexual self-concept, self-efficacy or intention to use condoms, safe sex behaviors, AIDS knowledge, assertive communication, or self-efficacy to perform testicular/ breast self-exams. Overall, participants who did not report a history of sexual abuse had significantly more sexual health resources and engaged in fewer sex-risk behaviors than those who reported having been abused. These differences have notable implications for screening adolescents for a history of sexual abuse. Adolescents who report sexual abuse should receive risk counseling and be screened regularly for the development of sexual risk behaviors.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to determine whether provision of health advocacy for homeless patients would reduce the burden of care for a primary healthcare team. The impact of a health advocacy intervention was assessed in a quasi-experimental, three-armed controlled trial. Homeless patients registering at an inner-city health centre were allocated in alternating periods to health advocacy (with or without outreach registration) or 'usual care' over a total intake period of 3 years. The client group were homeless people in hostels or other temporary accommodation in the Liverpool 8 area of the UK. The majority of participants (n = 400) were women (76%) in their twenties (mean age = 26.6 years). Most (63%) were temporarily housed at either one of the women's refuges or Liverpool City Council family hostels, and all were registered with an inner-city health centre. Data on health service utilisation over a 3-month period was collected for all clients recruited to the study and direct health service costs were measured. Homeless adults who were proactively registered by the health advocate on outreach visits to hostels made significantly less use of health centre resources whilst having more contact with the health advocate than patients who registered at the health centre at a time of need. There was no reduction in health centre workload when the offer of health advocacy was made after registration at the health centre. The additional costs of providing health advocacy were offset by a reduction in demand for health-centre-based care. The results demonstrate that health advocacy can alter the pattern of help-seeking by temporarily homeless adults. The intervention was cost-neutral. The short-term health service workload associated with symptomatic homeless patients requiring medication was not reduced, but outreach health advocacy was used successfully to address psycho-social issues and reduce the workload for primary care staff.

AB  - While research on homeless adolescents and young adults evidencing substance use disorder is increasing, there is a dearth of information regarding effective interventions, and more research is needed to guide those who serve this population. The current study builds upon prior research showing promising findings of the community reinforcement approach (CRA) (Slesnick, Prestopnik, Meyers, & Glassman, 2007). Homeless adolescents and young adults between the ages of 14 to 20 years were randomized to one of three theoretically distinct interventions: (1) CRA (n = 93), (2) motivational enhancement therapy (MET, n = 86), or (3) case management (CM, n = 91). The relative effectiveness of these interventions was evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months post-baseline. Findings indicated that substance use and associated problems were significantly reduced in all three interventions across time. Several moderating effects were found, especially for sex and history of childhood abuse. Findings show little evidence of superiority or inferiority of the three interventions and suggest that drop-in centers have choices for addressing the range of problems that these adolescents and young adults face.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to identify intimate partner violence (IPV) incidence rates, to quantify specific risks and characteristics of these incidents and the environments in which they occur, to identify how often children are present for or injured during these incidents, and to identify differences in victim reports of IPV to law enforcement officers at the scene of the incident compared with previously published reports of IPV from retropsective, anonymous surveys and domestic violence shelter interviews. Data gathered by responding law enforcement officers at the scene of the IPV incident were used to determine the prevalence of IPV incident characteristics and outcomes. Females aged 20 to 39 years, unmarried adults, and African Americans were disproportionately represented as victims of IPV in this study. IPV incidents were significantly more likely to occur on Saturdays and Sundays and during the months of May through August. Relationship durations for suspect–victim pairs were most often less than 12 months at the time of the incident. Weapon use and/or strangulation was common, occurring in 44% of all incidents. Minors (under age 18 years) were frequently present in the home during the IPV incident or a member of the household (59%). This study provides a unique perspective of IPV by utilizing data collected directly from the scene of the incident by first responders. Previously published characteristics of IPV were confirmed, but this study also brings to light new and critical information concerning this prevalent form of violence. Study findings relating to incidence, seasonality, severity, disproportionately affected populations, and child exposure are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: "Housing First" has been shown to improve housing stability in homeless individuals with mental illness, but had not been empirically tested in homeless youth. We aimed to evaluate the effect of "Housing First" on housing stability in homeless youth aged 18 to 24 years participating in At Home/Chez Soi, a 24-month randomized trial of "Housing First" in 5 Canadian cities. METHODS: Homeless individuals with mental illness were randomized to receive "Housing First" (combined with assertive community treatment or intensive case management depending on their level of need) or treatment as usual. We defined our primary outcome, housing stability, as the percent of days stably housed as a proportion of days for which residence data were available. RESULTS: Of 2148 participants who completed baseline interviews and were randomized, 7% (n = 156) were youth aged 18 to 24 years; 87 received "Housing First" and 69 received treatment as usual. In an adjusted analysis, youth in "Housing First" were stably housed a mean of 437 of 645 (65%) days for which data were available compared with youth in treatment as usual, who were stably housed a mean of 189 of 582 (31%) days for which data were available, resulting in an adjusted mean difference of 34% (95% confidence interval, 24%-45%; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: "Housing First" was associated with improved housing stability in homeless youth with mental illness. Future research should explore whether adaptations of the model for youth yield additional improvements in housing stability and other outcomes.

AB  - Abstract This study applies cumulative adversity and stress proliferation theories to examine risk and protective resource profiles of youth with three different levels of housing and parental care instability. Data derive from a state representative sample (n = 27,087) of school-based adolescent students. ANCOVA analyses identified significant differences in sociodemographic and psychosocial functioning variables for youth with 0, 1, or 2 forms of housing and parental care instability, with more deleterious functioning being observed among youth with greater levels of instability. Those experiencing either or both housing and parental care instability are more represented by males, sexual minorities, and youth of color; psychosocial risk and protective factors demonstrated consistent differences between instability groups. Dimensions of cumulative adversity operate with social marginalities (e.g., race, sexual minority status) relative to instability, with higher frequency of victimization, lower grades, diminished self-regulation capabilities and school engagement, weakened psychological health, and strained family and peer relationships. The paper discusses theorized mechanisms through which cumulative adversity conveys effects as well as implications for social work prevention and resilience-fostering strategies in schools and other youth-serving settings. Highlights • Youth instability in either housing or parental care is a growing concern in the U.S. and poses serious developmental risk. • LGBT youth and youth of color experience housing and parental care instability at higher rates. • Youth experiencing greater instability are distinguished by significantly poorer psychosocial and health functioning. • Youth experiencing greater instability report poorer academic performance and less prosocial opportunities.

AB  - Providing stable housing for runaway and homeless youth is a major function of a transitional living program. This article introduces the focus of one program working with LGBTQ youth in New York City and discusses some issues to consider when working with this population. The article also presents data associated with young people's lives after discharge. In any discussion of outcomes, both reason for discharge and length of stay play important roles in whether or not an exit is safe. Regardless of these two elements, the places youth move to when leaving programs are crucial to their safety and well-being. The exit can be safe even when a young person is discharged early from a program. This article presents types of exits, as well as status of employment and school enrollment at exit. Some youth and staff-identified lessons gained in the program also are discussed in detail. Types of aftercare services sought by discharged youth are specified. This article also describes any differences in outcomes for youth with and without foster care experience.

AB  - About 1.3 million homeless students attend schools across the US, yet little is known about their substance use patterns, especially substance use on school grounds. The objectives of this study were to examine differences in substance use on and off school grounds between nonsheltered homeless, sheltered homeless, and nonhomeless public school students, and to examine the relationship between homelessness and substance use in school. Data were from a statewide representative sample from the California Healthy Kids Survey collected in 2011-2013, (n = 390,028). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were applied. Findings show that compared to nonhomeless students, homeless students, both sheltered and nonsheltered, reported higher rates of age at first time of use under the age of 10, and recent substance use, for an array of substances, indulging alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and other illegal drugs. Additionally about 50% of nonsheltered homeless students, and 15% of sheltered homeless students reported having used substances in school in the past 30 days. Results from logistic regressions indicate that homelessness is associated with substance use in school. Particularly, nonsheltered homeless students were 17.41, 12.09, 11.36 and 17.59 times more likely to report smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, using marijuana and using other illegal drugs (respectively) in school in the past 30 days, compared to nonhomeless students. Sheltered homeless students were also more likely to use substances in school compared to nonhomeless students, but less likely compared to nonsheltered students. Findings highlight the need to develop differentiated school-based responses to each homeless subgroup and have conceptual, scientific and policy implications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Young adults living with perinatally acquired HIV infection (PHIVYAs) are at risk for poor biomedical and behavioral health outcomes. Few studies offer a comprehensive overview of the functioning of this population in young adulthood and the role of HIV. METHODS: Data come from the Child and Adolescent Self-Awareness and Health Study, a longitudinal behavioral health cohort study of PHIVYAs and perinatally HIV--exposed but uninfected young adults (PHEUYAs) who are compared on psychiatric and neurocognitive functioning, sexual and substance use behaviors, health and reproductive outcomes, and young adult milestones. RESULTS: Overall, 27% of participants met criteria for a psychiatric disorder, including mood (11%), anxiety (22%), and substance use (28%), with no HIV status differences. PHIVYAs performed worse on 2 neurocognitive tests. There were no HIV status differences in condomless sex (41%) or pregnancies (41% women; 38% men). Both groups exhibited similar adult milestones: 67% graduated high school or an equivalent, 19% were in college, and 42% were employed. However, 38% were neither in school or working, 12% reported incarceration, and 16% were ever homeless. Among PHIVYAs, 36% were viremic (>200 copies per mL), and 15% were severely immunocompromised (CD4+ cell count <100 cells per mm³). CONCLUSIONS: Many PHIVYAs achieve adult milestones related to school, employment, sexual relationships, and starting families. However, they and PHEUYAs have high rates of psychiatric and substance use disorders and behavioral risks, which can jeopardize long-term health and adult functioning, particularly in the context of HIV. These findings underscore an urgent need to escalate interventions.

AB  - Objective: To review the prevalence literature on psychological distress and psychiatric disorders among homeless youth in Australia, and to compare these rates with Australian youth as a whole. Method: Computerized databases were utilized to access all published Australian studies on psychological distress (as measured by standardized symptom scales and suicidal behaviour) and psychiatric disorders among homeless youth; in addition, unpublished Australian studies were utilized whenever accessible. A total of 14 separate studies were located, only three of which have included non-homeless control groups. In the current review, prevalence data from uncontrolled youth homelessness studies are compared with data from Australian community and student surveys. Results: Homeless youth have usually scored significantly higher on standardized measures of psychological distress than all domiciled control groups. Youth homelessness studies have also reported very high rates of suicidal behaviour, but methodological limitations in these studies make comparisons with community surveys difficult. Furthermore, rates of various psychiatric disorders are usually at least twice as high among homeless youth than among youth from community surveys. Conclusions: Homeless youth in Australia have extremely high rates of psychological distress and psychiatric disorders. As homeless youth are at risk of developing psychiatric disorders and possibly self-injurious behaviour the longer they are homeless, early intervention in relevant health facilities is required.

AB  - Abstract: The article describes a study carried out with a representative sample of homeless people in Madrid (Spain; N = 188). This study aims to corroborate the relationship identified in the literature between stressful life events and suicidal behaviour in a group in a situation of social exclusion, to assess the differences in the number and characteristics of stressful life events experienced by homeless people who are attempters and non‐attempters, and to identify which combination of stressful life events enables discrimination for suicide attempts among homeless people. The results show that 30% of homeless people in Madrid had attempted suicide, and 57.9% of them had done so for the first time when they were homeless. The interviewees are shown to have experienced a large amount of stressful life events, with substantially more stressors experienced by the homeless people who tried to commit suicide, during both their childhood and adolescence and throughout their life. Finally, we found that the combination of 7 stressful life events provided the best possible discrimination between homeless attempters and non‐attempters.

AB  - Purpose This study is an outcome evaluation of Cottage Housing Incorporated's Serna Village Program (CHI), a supportive housing program serving homeless families in Sacramento, California. Methods This quasi-experimental study examined a sample of 293 children and youth who lived with their parents in CHI between 2002 and 2009. Results 71% of the children had a history of foster care before CHI; 10% of the youth reentered foster care after graduating from CHI (compared with reentry rates of 20–40% from other studies). The CHI youth overall spent less time in care after foster care reentry when compared to other Sacramento County youth. Child welfare costs of the sample before entering CHI were $1,313,262, yet at reentry, child welfare costs were $295,632 (2.5 to 5 years after leaving CHI). Conclusions Child welfare recidivism rates and total child welfare costs after reentry may decrease for homeless families by providing them with permanent housing and support services.

AB  - Background: Young, black men who have sex with men are disproportionately impacted by the US HIV epidemic, and HIV-positive, young, black men who have sex with men face stark disparities in HIV clinical outcomes.Methods: We performed an observational analysis of the 199 HIV-positive black men aged 18 to 30 years followed up for 12 months in healthMpowerment, a randomized controlled trial of an Internet-based HIV prevention intervention, to identify time-varying correlates of self-reported viral suppression using relative risk (RR) regression.Results: Retention at the 12-month visit was 84%. One hundred five (65%) of 162 participants reported being undetectable at baseline. At 3, 6, and 12 months, 83 (72%) of 115, 84 (82%) of 103, and 101 (86%) of 117 reported an undetectable viral load, respectively. In a multivariable model, participants who reported homelessness (RR, 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-0.99), who had clinically significant depressive symptoms (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79-0.98), and who used methamphetamine or crack (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38-0.96) were less likely to report an undetectable viral load. Young men who engaged in condomless insertive anal intercourse were more likely to report viral suppression (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04-1.24).Conclusion: HIV care for young, black men who have sex with men must be multidimensional to address medical needs in the context of mental health, substance use, and housing insecurity.

AB  - Previous research has shown that homeless youth have high rates of suicidal ideation, sexual abuse, and abuse of alcohol and other drugs. However, little is known about how these rates differ by gender and ethnicity. Our objective was to describe patterns of sexual abuse, alcohol and other drug use, and indicators of suicidal behaviors in homeless adolescents and to determine gender and ethnic differences in these factors. We used secondary data analysis of data from surveys completed by 96 homeless youth whose average age was 17.9 years.Over 60% of the sample reported a history of sexual abuse; the majority were under the age of 12 years when they first tried alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine; 56.3% had injected drugs, and 46.9% had tried inhalants. During the past 12 months, 35.1% had seriously considered suicide and 12.3% had actually attempted suicide at least once. Significantly more Hispanics than Whites had considered suicide (chi square = 4.31, p = .038). A disproportionate number of Hispanics (95% of the sample) reported a history of sexual abuse. Participants with a history of sexual abuse were significantly more likely than those who did not have a history of sexual abuse to have used alcohol and/or marijuana (chi square = 9.93, p < .01) and to have considered suicide in the past 12 months (F = 14.93, p < .001). We found that sexual abuse history is greater in this sample than in the general population and is particularly prevalent among Hispanic/Latino subjects. As in other studies, sexual abuse was more common among females than among males. High prevalence of sexual abuse, alcohol and other drug use, and suicidal behaviors in this sample of homeless youth underscores the need to develop and test community-based interventions to improve their health status.

AB  - Female homeless youths are vulnerable to risky sex and substance use behaviors, yet they have strengths known as psychological capital. A quasi-experimental pre-post research design with repeated measures was used to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a brief intervention to enhance psychological capital, reduce health-risk behaviors, and achieve short-term behavioral goals. Study participants were 80 ethnically diverse homeless women between the ages of 18 and 23 years. Intervention participants had significant improvements in psychological capital, hope, resilience, and self-efficacy to refuse alcohol, social connectedness, and substance use (p < .05). There was a significant group by time interaction for safe sex self-efficacy; intervention participants had greater self-confidence in negotiating safer sex practices than comparison participants. At the follow-up post-test, 82% of intervention participants who remained in the study had met or exceeded their short-term goals. This brief, street-based intervention was feasible and showed preliminary efficacy.

AB  - Background While opioid agonist therapy (OAT) reduces the risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) acquisition among people who inject drugs (PWID), protective effects may be attenuated in females. We used pooled data from an international collaboration of prospective cohorts to assess sex disparities in HCV incidence among PWID exposed to OAT. Methods Independent predictors of HCV infection were identified using Cox regression models with random effects after accounting for the clustering effect of study sites. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are presented in sex‐specific analyses. Results Among 701 participants exposed to OAT, HCV incidence was 16.5/100 person-years of observation (PYO) (95% CI, 13.1–20.7) in females and 7.6/100 PYO (95% CI, 6.0–9.5) in males (female:male adjusted HR [aHR], 1.80 [95% CI, 1.37–2.22]; P <.001). Factors associated with HCV acquisition among females exposed to OAT included nonwhite race (aHR, 1.79 [95% CI, 1.25–2.56]; P =.001), unstable housing (aHR, 4.00 [95% CI, 3.62–4.41]; P <.001), daily or more frequent injection (aHR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.01–2.08]; P =.042), and receptive syringe sharing (aHR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.33–1.53]; P <.001). Conclusions Female PWID exposed to OAT are twice as likely as their male counterparts to acquire HCV. While there is a need for better understanding of sex differences in immune function and opioid pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, structural and behavioral interventions that target women are required to bolster the efficacy of OAT in preventing HCV transmission.

AB  - Objective: Individuals experiencing homelessness are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity. The At Home/Chez Soi study provides a unique opportunity to first examine baseline levels of food security among homeless individuals with mental illness and second to evaluate the effect of a Housing First (HF) intervention on food security in this population.Design: At Home/Chez Soi was a 2-year randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of HF compared with usual care among homeless adults with mental illness, stratified by level of need for mental health services (high or moderate). Logistic regressions tested baseline associations between food security (US Food Security Survey Module), study site, sociodemographic variables, duration of homelessness, alcohol/substance use, physical health and service utilization. Negative binomial regression determined the impact of the HF intervention on achieving levels of high or marginal food security over an 18-month follow-up period (6 to 24 months).Setting: Community settings at five Canadian sites (Moncton, Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver).Subjects: Homeless adults with mental illness (n 2148).Results: Approximately 41 % of our sample reported high or marginal food security at baseline, but this figure varied with gender, age, mental health issues and substance use problems. High need participants who received HF were more likely to achieve marginal or high food security than those receiving usual care, but only at the Toronto and Moncton sites.Conclusions: Our large multi-site study demonstrated low levels of food security among homeless experiencing mental illness. HF showed promise for improving food security among participants with high levels of need for mental health services, with notable site differences.

AB  - Homeless girls are one of the world’s most vulnerable sociocultural groups. Homeless girls experience forced labor victimization, sexual exploitation, abuse, discrimination and marginalization at higher rates than the general population. As a result, they often present internalized and externalized psychological disorders and lack functional problem solving, coping and emotion regulation skills, which can negatively affect mental health and well-being. Despite these serious disparities, few research studies have addressed homeless girls’ mental health and well-being. Virtually no known research addressing the psychosocial differences between sub-groups of Mexican homeless girls, including girls that are at risk of homelessness and unhoused girls or girls housed in emergency shelters, exists to date. The aim of this study was to examine differences of psychosocial characteristics in homeless girls by subgroup. Working with nongovernmental organizations that serve homeless youth, a convenience sample of 90 Mexican girls between the ages of 11 and 18, including 45 emergency sheltered or unsheltered girls and a comparison group of 45 girls at risk of homelessness, were individually interviewed using psychometric instruments developed by the authors. Findings revealed that emergency sheltered or unsheltered homeless girls experience higher levels of depression, higher levels of dysfunctional emotional regulation strategies, lower indexes of subjective well-being, and experience negative emotions more intensely and frequently than the comparison at risk for homelessness group. This study is limited in its generalizability due to its purposive sampling method. Study implications highlight the need for specific interventions by sub-group to promote the mental health and well-being of homeless girls and girls at risk for homelessness.

AB  - This study examines gender differences in the characteristics of young people ( N = 1000) attending alcohol and other drug (AOD) services in the state of Victoria, Australia. Females demonstrate levels of substance use that are at least as high, and perhaps more harmful than that of males. Our data add to a growing base of evidence that young women attending youth AOD services experience additional psychosocial problems at higher rates than their male counterparts. This evidence is now fairly consistent in regard to mental health problems, self-injury, suicide attempts, and homelessness. Findings from this study further suggest that the gender imbalance may extend to child protection involvement, family conflict and disconnection, access to social support, and exposure to neglect and abuse.

AB  - Homeless young adults ages 18-25 exhibit high rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use, and sexual risk behaviors such as unprotected sex. Yet few programs exist for this population that are both effective and can be easily incorporated into settings serving this population. This pilot cluster cross-over randomized controlled trial evaluates AWARE, a voluntary four session group-based motivational interviewing (MI) intervention to reduce AOD use and sexual risk behavior. We evaluated AWARE with 200 homeless young adults using drop-in center services in Los Angeles County (mean age=21.8years; 73% male; 79% heterosexual; 31% non-Hispanic White, 25% African American, 24% Hispanic, 21% multiracial/other). Surveys were completed at baseline and three months after program completion. Retention in the AWARE program was excellent (79% attended multiple sessions) and participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the program. AWARE participants self-reported positive change in their past 3month and past 30day alcohol use (ps≤0.05), motivation to change drug use (ps<0.05), and condom use self-efficacy (p=0.05) compared to the control group. Among those with multiple sex partners, AWARE participants showed a decrease in unprotected sexual events (p<0.05), whereas the control group did not. Results from this pilot evaluation are promising, suggesting that a brief group-MI risk reduction intervention can be effective in helping homeless young adults make positive changes in their alcohol and condom use. Further work is needed to more fully evaluate the efficacy of AWARE on AOD behavior and sexual risk behavior outcomes.

AB  - The relation between mild to borderline intellectual disability (MBID) and violent offense behavior was studied among a group of former juvenile delinquents currently in a diversion program for persistent young adult violent offenders from Amsterdam ( N = 146). Offenders were considered MBID if they had received juvenile probation from the local youth care agency specialized in intellectual disability (21%). A file study was used to estimate prevalence rates of criminogenic risk factors. Police data were used to depict recent criminal behavior. Nearly all offenders grew up in large and unstable multi-problem households and had psychosocial problems. More MBID offenders displayed externalizing behavior before the age of 12, were susceptible to peer pressure, and had low social-relational skills. MBID offenders committed more violent property crimes than offenders without MBID. Youth care interventions for MBID offenders should focus on the acquisition of social-relational skills and on the pedagogical skills of parents.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fifteen percent of US children live in households with inadequate food. Children who are food insecure often experience worse physical, emotional, and developmental health outcomes. Authors of previous studies have not examined the quality and cost implications of food insecurity in children. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 7959 nationally representative US children (aged 1--17 years) in the 2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Households with food insecurity were identified by $3 positive responses to the 30-day, 10-item US Food Security Survey. Main outcomes were annual health expenditures and quality of care indicators: emergency department (ED) and inpatient use, primary care and specialist visits, routine medical and dental care, patient experience measures, and school absenteeism. Logistic and 2-part regression models were constructed to estimate outcomes conditional on sociodemographic and medical covariates. RESULTS: Children in households with food insecurity were more often publicly insured and had special needs compared with all other children. In multivariable logistic regression, household food insecurity was associated with significantly higher adjusted odds of an ED (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.37) or primary care treatment visit (aOR = 1.24) during the year. Household food insecurity was associated with significantly higher school absenteeism (aOR = 1.74) and lower access to care for routine (aOR = 0.55) or illness (aOR = 0.57) care. There were no differences in annual health expenditures, hospitalizations, or receipt of routine medical or dental care. CONCLUSIONS: Household food insecurity is associated with higher ED use and school absenteeism and lower access to care; however, it was not associated with higher annual health expenditures in children.

AB  - This article systematically reviews studies exploring resilience among youth experiencing homelessness. We searched eight databases, and 21 articles fit the inclusion criteria and represented four methodologies: qualitative (n = 7, 33.3%), survey and secondary data analysis (n = 8, 38.1%), quantitative (n = 4, 19.1%), and mixed-method (n = 2, 9.5%) designs. Studies indicate that youth experiencing homelessness rely on informal social networks for survival, and that spirituality, mental health, and creativity are associated with enhanced coping. More experimental and intervention studies are necessary to support evidence-based resilience practices. Additionally, researchers need to exercise more self-awareness about how stereotypical pejorative paradigms may constrain innovative, strengths-based scholarship.

AB  - Rental assistance, in the form of vouchers and project-based subsidized housing, is a primary source of affordable housing for low-income Americans, given a growing and severe shortage of private-market rental units. However, due to supply constraints, fewer than one in four eligible households receive this kind of assistance. In this paper, we examine associations between receipt of rental assistance and self-rated health among a sample of 400 low-income adults in one U.S. city. We find that individuals who currently receive rental assistance have lower odds of reporting poor or fair self-rated health than individuals who are currently on rental assistance waiting lists. These relationships persist after adjusting for factors that affect access to rental assistance and are not significantly modified by criminal justice history. Our findings suggest that the current unmet need for rental assistance may contribute to poor health among low-income Americans.

AB  - • Indegree centrality was associated with education service use. • Positive staff relationships and outdegree were associated with employment service use. • Education, housing, LGBTQ+ identity and location were associated with service use. Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) face significant obstacles to educational achievement and gainful employment. Drop-in centers offer support services to facilitate these opportunities, but there remains a need to understand which youth are most likely to use them. The present study used a diffusion of innovations framework to examine social network correlates of service use over a three-month period. Positive staff relationships, personal network exposure, and structural network measures were examined. Participants were 253 YEH (M age = 21.9, SD = 2.2) participating in an HIV-prevention trial at three drop-in centers in Los Angeles. Surveys were completed at baseline (wave 1), 1-month (wave 2) and 3-months (wave 3) post-baseline. Individual characteristics and sociometric network ties to other youth were assessed. Cross-sectional and lagged logistic regression models were used to identify significant network correlates of service use. A significant minority of YEH used education (23.6%) or employment (33.7%) services at wave 1, with modest increases at waves 2 and 3. Indegree centrality was associated with education service use at wave 1 (OR = 1.30, 95% CI[1.04, 1.64]). Positive staff relationships were associated with employment service use at wave 1 (OR = 2.05, 95% CI[1.06, 2.99]), and outdegree was associated with employment service use at wave 3 (OR = 1.69, 95% CI[1.13, 2.55]). In addition, education level, housing situation, LGBTQ+ identity, drop-in center location, and duration of drop-in center use were related to service usage. Youth who occupy more central network positions and/or report positive relationships with staff are more likely to use higher-level drop-in services. Network approaches to engaging youth in services should be considered along with other individual and contextual factors.

AB  - Background: Household food insecurity, a measure of income-related problems of food access, is a pressing public health problem in Canada's North, especially in Nunavut. We aimed to assess the impact of Nutrition North Canada, a food retail subsidy intended to improve food access and affordability in isolated communities, on household food insecurity in Nunavut.Methods: Using data from 3250 Nunavut households sampled in the annual components of the Canadian Community Health Survey (2007 to 2016), we conducted interrupted time series regression analyses to determine whether the introduction of Nutrition North Canada was associated with changes in the rates of self-reported food insecurity, according to a validated instrument. We used propensity score weighting to control for several sociodemographic characteristics associated with food insecurity.Results: Food insecurity affected 33.1% of households in 2010 (the year before the launch of Nutrition North Canada), 39.4% of households in 2011 (the year of the launch) and 46.6% of households in 2014 (the year after full implementation). After controlling for several covariates, we found the rate of food insecurity increased by 13.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7 to 24.7) after the full implementation of the subsidy program, and the increase in food insecurity first occurred in 2011 (9.6 percentage points, 95% CI 2.7 to 16.4), the year Nutrition North Canada was launched.Interpretation: Food insecurity was a pervasive problem in Nunavut before Nutrition North Canada, but it has become even more prevalent since the program was implemented. Given the important health consequences of food insecurity, more effective initiatives to address food insecurity in Canada's North are urgently needed.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the engagement of young people who use drugs (PWUD) in harm reduction programs (HRPs), and few studies have included non-opioid users and non-injectors. While HRPs have effectively engaged PWUD, young people are under-represented in their services.Methods: The Injection Drug Users Health Alliance Citywide Study (IDUCS) is the largest community-based study of PWUD in HRPs in the US. From 2014-2015, 2421 HRP participants across New York City (NYC) completed a cross-sectional survey. We investigated differences in socio-demographics, service utilization, and risk behaviors between young (aged 18-30) and older participants and examined factors associated with overdose among young participants.Results: The study included 257 young participants. They were significantly more likely than older participants to be white, educated, uninsured, unstably housed or homeless, and have a history of incarceration and residential drug treatment. They were more likely to report recent overdose but less likely to report knowledge of naloxone. Young participants also had higher rates of alcohol, marijuana, benzodiazepine, and injection drug use, and related risk behaviors such as public injection. Factors associated with past year overdose among young participants included experiencing symptoms of psychological distress (AOR=9.71), being unstably housed or homeless (AOR=4.39), and utilizing detox (AOR=4.20).Conclusions: Young PWUD who access services at HRPs in NYC differ significantly from their older counterparts. New York City and other urban centers that attract young PWUD should consider implementing harm reduction oriented services tailored to the unique needs of young people.

AB  - Background: While some recent research has addressed homeless youth from a strengths-based approach, comparative studies of homeless and non-homeless youth from a strengths perspective are few; research that includes youth's views on positive youth development are also limited. Objective: Addressing these gaps and using an inductive approach, adolescents' views on positive development and their strengths were solicited. This study investigated the qualitative differences in views on doing well, strengths and positive development from two youth samples: youth who were homeless and resident youth involved in a 4-H program. Methods: Thirty-eight adolescents participated in focus groups, including five groups from a homeless shelter and five groups from a 4-H program. Content analysis of the narrative responses was conducted. Results: Differences between homeless and 4-H adolescents were found in the areas of happiness, family support, identity, personal strengths, and risk avoidance. Homeless youth revealed adaptation to limiting ecologies (e.g., non-supportive parents) as they sought out other supportive relationships instead and adjusted their views of happiness. Homeless adolescents demonstrated more internal self-awareness compared to 4-H adolescents. Conclusions: By recognizing and capitalizing on the unique perspectives and strengths of adolescents from divergent environments, positive youth development and strengths-based programs and theory can more effectively benefit youth from diverse backgrounds. Understanding youth's views that have normative and non-normative experiences (i.e., non-homeless and homeless) helps further expand the boundaries of developmental models and address how to promote thriving in youth from various contexts.

AB  - Aim: More than 26 000 Australians aged 12-24 years experience homelessness, yet data on the health status of homeless youth remain limited. The aim of this study was to describe the health of young people attending a youth health service in Western Sydney who were experiencing homelessness.Methods: Retrospective case note review for clients aged 12-25 years attending Youth Health Services in Western Sydney. Extracted data included: homelessness status; demographics; physical health issues; mental health issues; involvement with juvenile justice; and disengagement from education or employment.Results: Just under half of the 180 clients attending a Youth Health Service in Western Sydney were homeless, and an additional 15 young people who were not currently homeless nominated homelessness as a presenting issue. In comparison with currently domiciled young people, homeless youth were less likely to have a regular general practitioner and more likely to nominate a physical health concern as a presenting issue, although there was no difference between groups in terms of diagnosed mental or physical health conditions. Considered as a whole, the sample showed high rates of acute physical symptoms, physical trauma, psychological distress and self-harm.Conclusions: Youth homelessness is associated with risk of both poor physical and mental health. As much of youth homelessness is hidden, health-care providers need to ensure that they inquire about homelessness status, and have an awareness of potentially complex multi-morbidities in the physical and mental health of young marginalised people presenting to health services.

AB  - The McKinney-Vento Homeless Education Assistance Improvements Act of 2001 (MCKV), which provides funds to local educational agencies (LEAs), is almost a decade old, yet no evaluations of its academic effectiveness have been reported. Using a systems theory framework, the authors answer the question of whether homeless students in grade 6 from LEAs that received MCKV funding scored better in reading comprehension and mathematics on end-of-grade (EOG) test scores than did those from LEAs that did not receive MCKV funding. Data from 2006 and 2007 were provided by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. About 20 percent of the state's LEAs received MCKV grants, which created a treatment group (funded LEAs) and a control group (nonfunded LEAs). Using untreated control group designs with matched pretests (grade 5 EOG test scores) and posttests (grade 6 EOG test scores), 2 x 2 analyses of variance with repeated measures failed to reject the null hypotheses. The authors did not support the hypotheses that MCKV grants improved the academic achievement of homeless students. There was no significant difference in the funded and nonfunded EOG test scores.

AB  - Behavioral weight loss (BWL) for pediatric obesity includes guidance on improving the home food environment and dietary quality; yet food insecurity presents barriers to making these changes. This study examined if home food environment, dietary quality, energy intake, and body weight changes during adolescent obesity treatment differed by food security status, and if changes in the home food environment were associated with changes in dietary quality and energy intake by food security status. Adolescents (n = 82; 13.7 ± 1.2 years) with obesity participated in a 4-month BWL treatment. Food insecurity, home food environment (Home Food Inventory [HFI]), dietary quality (Healthy Eating Index [HEI]), energy intake, and body mass index (BMI) were assessed at baseline and post-treatment. A reduced obesogenic home food environment and improved dietary quality were observed for food secure (ps < 0.01), but not insecure households (ps > 0.05) (mean difference, HFI: −6.6 ± 6.4 vs. −2.4 ± 7.4; HEI: 5.1 ± 14.4 vs. 2.7 ± 17.7). Energy intake and BMI decreased for adolescents in food secure and insecure households (ps < 0.03) (mean difference; energy intake: −287 ± 417 vs. −309 ± 434 kcal/day; BMI: −1.0 ± 1.4 vs. −0.7 ± 1.4). BWL yielded similar reductions in energy intake and body weight yet did not offer the same benefits for improved dietary quality and the home food environment for adolescents with food insecurity.

AB  - Background: Opioid-related overdose rates continue to climb. However, little research has examined the reach of overdose education and naloxone trainings among people who inject drugs (PWID). Understanding gaps in coverage is essential to improving the public health response to the ongoing crisis.Methods: We surveyed 298 PWID in Baltimore City, MD. We conducted a latent class analysis of drug use indicators and tested for differences by class in past month overdose, having received overdose training, and currently having naloxone.Results: Three classes emerged: cocaine/heroin injection (40.2%), heroin only injection (32.2%), and multi-drug/multi-route use (27.6%). The prevalence of past month overdose differed marginally by class (p = 0.06), with the multi-drug/multi-route use class having the highest prevalence (22.5%) and the heroin only class having the lowest (4.6%). The prevalence of previous overdose training differed significantly by class (p = 0.02), with the heroin/cocaine class (76.5%) having more training than the other two classes. Training was least common amongst the multi-drug/multi-route class (60.3%), though not statistically different from the heroin only class (63.0%). Classes did not differ significantly in current naloxone possession, although the multi-drug/multi-route class exhibited the lowest prevalence of naloxone possession (37.2%).Conclusions: People who inject multiple substances are at high risk for overdose and are also the least likely to receive overdose trainings. The current service landscape does not adequately reach individuals with high levels of structural vulnerability and high levels of drug use and homelessness. Actively including this subgroup into harm reduction efforts are essential for preventing overdose fatalities.

AB  - This study compared the costs and outcomes associated with three treatment programs that served 149 individuals with dual disorders (i.e., individuals with co-occurring severe mental illness and substance use disorders) who were homeless at baseline. The three treatment programs were: Integrated Assertive Community Treatment (IACT), Assertive Community Treatment only (ACTO), and standard care (Control). Participants were randomly assigned to treatment and followed for a period of 24 months. Clients in the IACT and ACTO programs were more satisfied with their treatment program and reported more days in stable housing than clients in the Control condition. There were no significant differences between treatment groups on psychiatric symptoms and substance use. The average total costs associated with the IACT and Control conditions were significantly less than the average total costs for the ACTO condition.

AB  - • Propensity score matching was used to closely match foster youth and nonfoster youth. • Youth were evaluated on factors that predict difficulties in adulthood. Foster youth and youth who grow up in poverty are at risk for experiencing difficulties in adulthood. However, youth in foster care may be at a greater disadvantage due to additional stressors associated with being removed from home and placed into care. Much of the research assessing outcomes associated with foster care compare foster youth to other youth in care or to youth in the general population. In the current study, we used propensity scores and careful sampling to closely match a sample of 17-year-old foster youth (N = 332) with a group of 17-year-old high-risk youth (N = 83) who had not experienced foster care to evaluate them on risk and protective factors associated with various outcomes in adulthood. A well-fitting structural equation model (SEM) indicated that compared to high risk youth who have never been in foster care, youth in foster care experience higher rates of incarceration, homelessness, early parenthood, and referral to drug and/or alcohol treatment as well as lower levels of education attainment. An interaction between foster care status and gender significantly predicted incarceration. Males in foster care were more likely to experience incarceration compared to other youth. These experiences predict further difficulties in adulthood. Implications for youth currently in care are discussed.

AB  - Objective: Permanent supportive housing (PSH) programs are being implemented nationally and on a large scale. However, little is known about PSH for transition-age youths (ages 18 to 24). This study estimated health services costs associated with participation in PSH among youths and examined the relationship between fidelity to the Housing First model and health service outcomes.Methods: Administrative data were used in a quasi-experimental, difference-in-differences design with a propensity score-matched contemporaneous control group to compare health service costs among 2,609 youths in PSH and 2,609 youths with serious mental illness receiving public mental health services in California from January 1, 2004, through June 30, 2010. Data from a survey of PSH program practices were merged with the administrative data to examine changes in service use among 1,299 youths in 63 PSH programs by level of fidelity to the Housing First model.Results: Total service costs increased by $13,337 among youths in PSH compared with youths in the matched control group. Youths in higher-fidelity programs had larger declines in use of inpatient services and larger increases in outpatient visits compared with youths in lower-fidelity programs.Conclusions: PSH for youths was associated with substantial increases in costs. Higher-fidelity PSH programs may be more effective than lower-fidelity programs in reducing use of inpatient services and increasing use of outpatient services. As substantial investments are made in PSH for youths, it is imperative that these programs are designed and implemented to maximize their effectiveness and their impact on youth outcomes.

AB  - Objective: Though previous research has identified the high burden of mental health and addiction (MHA) concerns among precariously housed youth, earlier studies have not examined differences in MHA concerns among housing insecure Canadian youth across sectors. This study examines this issue using the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs Short Screener (GAIN-SS) in a cross-sectoral sample of Canadian youth. Method: A total of 2605 youth ages 12 to 24 seeking services across sectors completed the GAIN-SS and a sociodemographic form. The analyses described demographic variables and sector of presentation, then evaluated internalizing, externalizing, substance use, and crime/ violence concerns based on housing status. Results: While many precariously housed youth presented through the housing/outreach/support sector, 33.6% presented to other sectors. Housing groups endorsed comparably high levels of internalizing and externalizing problems. However, precariously housed youth reported higher rates of problematic substance use (OR = 1.54; 95% CI 1.25, 1.88; p < 0.01) and crime/violence issues (OR = 1.95; 95% CI 1.54, 2.46; p < 0.01). Precariously housed youth were 48% more likely to endorse concurrent disorders (OR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.21, 1.82; p < 0.01), which was largely driven by the high rate of concurrent disorders among precariously housed females. Conclusions: Since precariously housed youth with multiple clinical needs presented across sectors, attention must be given to screening for both housing stability and MHA and building stronger cross-sectoral partnerships. The findings should encourage systematic screening, MHA training and capacity building within housing sectors as well as integrated services across all youth-serving organizations.
AB  - Objectif: Bien que la recherche antérieure ait identifié le lourd fardeau des problèmes de santé mentale et de dépendance (SMD) chez les jeunes au logement précaire, les études précédentes n'ont pas examiné les différences des problèmes de SMD chez les jeunes canadiens au logement précaire de tous les secteurs. La présente étude se penche sur cette question à l'aide de la version abrégée de l'évaluation générale des besoins individuels (GAIN-SS) dans un échantillon intersectoriel de jeunes canadiens. Méthode: Un total de 2605 jeunes de 12 à 24 ans demandant des services dans tous les secteurs ont rempli la GAIN-SS et un formulaire sociodémographique. Les analyses ont décrit les variables démographiques et le secteur de présentation, puis évalué l'internalisation, l'externalisation, l'utilisation de substances, et les problèmes de crime/violence basés sur la situation du logement. Résultats: Même si nombre de jeunes au logement précaire se sont présentés dans le secteur logement/entraide/soutien, 33,6% d'entre eux se sont présentés à d'autres secteurs. Les groupes de logement présentaient des niveaux comparativement élevés de problèmes d'internalisation et d'externalisation. Toutefois, les jeunes au logement précaire déclaraient des taux élevés d'utilisation de substances problématique (RC = 1,54; IC à 95% 1,25 à 1,88; p < 0,01) et des problèmes de crime/violence (RC = 1,95; IC à 95% 1,54 à 2,46; p < 0,01). Les jeunes au logement précaire étaient 48% plus susceptibles de présenter des troubles co-occurrents (RC = 1,48; IC à 95% 1,21 à 1,82; p < 0,01), ce qui était largement attribuable au taux élevé de troubles co-occurrents chez les jeunes femmes au logement précaire. Conclusions: Puisque les jeunes au logement précaire ayant de multiples besoins cliniques étaient présents dans tous les secteurs, il faut porter notre attention au dépistage de l'instabilité du logement et de la SMD, et former des partenariats intersectoriels plus solides. Les résultats devraient encourager un dépistage systématique, la formation en matière de SMD et de renforcement des capacités dans les secteurs de logement ainsi que les services intégrés dans tous les organismes qui desservent les jeunes.

AB  - The number of women under community supervision in the United States has increased, and this population has a high risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We examined STI prevalence and multiple risk factors among drug-involved women under community supervision in New York City. Data were from a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of a behavioral HIV/STI intervention (Women on the Road to Health [WORTH]) among drug-involved women in the community corrections system in New York City from 2009 to 2012. To be eligible for inclusion, women had to be under community supervision within the past 90 days, have used illicit drugs at least once in the past six months, and have unprotected sex at least once in the past 90 days. Participants completed a survey containing items on STI risk factors and were tested for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Multivariable regression was used to examine associations between risk factors and STI diagnosis. Of 333 women tested, 89 (26.7%) tested positive for an STI. Ten (3.0%) were positive for C. trachomatis, 4 (1.2%) for N. gonorrhoeae, and 77 (23.1%) for T. vaginalis. Women with any STI were more likely to be black (AOR: 2.02; 95% CI: 1.08-3.77), homeless in the past 90 days (AOR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.01-4.26), arrested in the past 90 days (AOR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.14-3.39), and have a greater number of sexual partners in the past 90 days (AOR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.08-1.42). Drug-using women under community supervision have a high burden of STIs driven by multiple risk factors. Implementing STI screening, prevention, and treatment programs in community supervision settings could facilitate a reduction in STIs among this population.

AB  - Abstract Families experiencing homelessness struggle with food access and face a high burden of nutrition-related diseases. We assessed feasibility of Feastworthy, a prepared meal delivery program for families in motel-shelters with meals made from surplus food from local colleges. We used pre-and post-program surveys and semi-structured interviews, comparing participating families with families in a nearby shelter. During the three-month pilot, Feastworthy delivered 4,875 meals to 38 families; 33 families participated in the study (20 intervention and 13 control). Families reported that the motel-shelter worsened their diet and health, and reported increased food security and healthier diets with Feastworthy. In difference-in-differences analyses, vegetable intake trended upward by 0.6 servings/day (p=.08) among participants relative to comparison-site individuals. Changes in food security scores and out-of-pocket food expenses were no different. A delivered meal program was feasible and may provide health benefits for homeless families. Future larger-scale, longer-term studies will clarify its befits.

AB  - This paper presents findings from a study of how care leavers access and use housing services, and what they said had helped them to do so. The sample comprised 80 care leavers, and, for comparison, a group of 59 young people (termed 'in difficulty') who met certain criteria of disadvantage. Care leavers were found to have fewer crisis transitions and less experience of homelessness, together with a much higher level of autonomy and support in their first accommodation, relative to other young people in difficulty. Several factors are identified that, from the care leavers' point of view, contributed to their better access and use of housing services, including having family and friends to turn to, and leaving care teams that negotiated on their behalf with housing services. The paper concludes that care leavers had more positive housing experiences than other young people in difficulty, helped by the improved preparation for independence and ongoing support available to them from leaving care teams.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between homelessness and psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders, on one hand, and cause-specific and all-cause mortality on the other in a high-income country.Methods: A historical nationwide register-based cohort study of the Danish population from 15 years of age between 2000 and 2011 was conducted. The association between homelessness, psychiatric disorders, and mortality was analysed by Poisson Regression adjusting for important confounders. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated for people with a history of homelessness compared with the general population using direct age-standardisation.Results: During 51,892,324 person-years of observation, 656,448 died. People with at least one homeless shelter contact accounted for 173,592 person-years with 4345 deaths. The excess mortality in the population experiencing homelessness compared with the general population was reduced by 50% after adjusting for psychiatric diagnoses, including substance use disorders (mortality rate ratio (MRR) for men 3.30, 95% CI 3.18-3.41; women 4.41, 95% CI 4.14-4.71). Full adjustment including physical comorbidity and socioeconomic factors in a sub-cohort aged 15-29 years resulted in an MRR of 3.94 (95% CI 3.10-5.02) compared with the general population. The excess mortality associated with homelessness differed according to psychiatric diagnosis, sex, and cause of death.Conclusions: A mental health or a substance use disorder combined with homelessness considerably increases the risk of death. However, homelessness is also independently associated with high mortality. Differences in the association between homelessness and mortality in men and women suggest the need for sex-tailored interventions.

AB  - Objective: The SSI/SSDI Outreach, Access, and Recovery (SOAR) program has been shown to increase access to Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability Insurance benefits among homeless adults. However, little empirical data exist on how or for whom SOAR achieves successful application outcomes. This study investigated applicant and application characteristics associated with disability application outcomes among homeless adults.Methods: Secondary data on 6,361 SOAR-assisted applications were obtained. Multilevel models investigated between-applicant differences in application processing time and decision as a function of applicant and application characteristics.Results: Older age and living in an institution were associated with greater odds of application approval. Female gender and receipt of public assistance were associated with longer processing time and lower odds of approval. Except for quality review, SOAR critical components were associated with greater odds of approval.Conclusions: Women and adults receiving public assistance appear disadvantaged in the SOAR application process. SOAR critical components promote successful disability application outcomes.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the methodological quality and effectiveness of behavioural smoking cessation interventions targeted at six disadvantaged groups; the homeless, prisoners, indigenous populations, at-risk youth, individuals with low socio-economic status and individuals with a mental illness. Methods Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and PsycInfo databases were searched using MeSH and keywords for studies conducted in developed countries prior to October 2010. Included studies were assessed for methodological quality. A DerSimonian and Laird random effects meta-analysis was conducted where possible to explore the effectiveness of interventions for the different subgroups. A narrative review was conducted for studies unable to be included in the meta-analysis. Outcomes examined were abstinence rates at short-term (up to 3 months) and long-term (6 months or the longest) follow-up. Results Thirty-two relevant studies were identified. The majority ( n = 20) were rated low in methodological quality. Results of the meta-analysis showed a significant increase in cessation for behavioural support interventions targeted at low-income female smokers at short-term follow-up [relative risk (RR) 1.68, confidence interval (CI) 1.21-2.33], and behavioural support interventions targeted at individuals with a mental illness at long-term follow-up (RR 1.35, CI 1.01-1.81). Results of the narrative review showed several promising interventions that increased cessation rates at 6-month or longer follow-up. Conclusions Few well-controlled trials have examined the most effective smoking cessation strategies for highly disadvantaged groups, especially among the homeless, indigenous smokers and prisoners. The use of behavioural smoking cessation interventions for some socially disadvantaged groups appears promising; however, overall findings are inconsistent. Further research is needed to establish the most effective interventions for vulnerable high-risk groups. Special attention should be given to increasing sample size and power, and to sound evaluation methodology to overcome methodological limitations of conducting research with these high-risk groups.

AB  - Intervention fidelity is an ongoing concern for rigorous research, from the initial stages of planning and study design to the maintenance of internal validity. An added concern is the balance between fidelity and design accommodation to better suit varied populations and individuals. In this article, we describe our process for monitoring intervention fidelity during an individualized, yet standardized, strengths-based intervention with homeless youths, in which we include periodic training of our professional intervention facilitators. In our ongoing study, which is based on a Solomon four-group design with repeated measures, monitoring and training are essential to ensure intervention fidelity. Despite a rich literature about intervention fidelity, little guidance is available to help researchers and practitioners implement fidelity strategies in the real world with vulnerable populations. This article addresses this gap.

AB  - Objective: To characterize disparities in cumulative plasma HIV burden in a sample of adults accessing HIV care in San Francisco, California.Design: Observational cohort and supplemental HIV surveillance data.Methods: Data from the San Francisco Medical Monitoring Project 2012-2014 cycles and HIV surveillance data were used to create an analytic cohort followed for 2 years. Matched HIV viral load test results from HIV surveillance were used to create five viral outcome measures: any unsuppressed viral load (>200 copies/ml), any transmittable viral load (>1500 copies/ml), person-time spent unsuppressed, person-time spent transmittable, and 2-year viremia copy-years, a measure of cumulative plasma HIV burden. Rao-Scott chi-squares and analysis of variance examined differences in durable suppression and mean percentage time spent unsuppressed and transmittable. Weighted linear regression was used to describe differences in cumulative HIV burden.Results: Adults receiving HIV care spent approximately 12% of the 2-year time period with an unsuppressed viral load and approximately 7% of the time at a transmittable viral level. Factors independently associated with higher cumulative HIV viremia in an adjusted model included trans women identity, younger age, lower CD4 cell count, and a history of homelessness, incarceration, not taking ART, and nonadherence to ART.Conclusion: Although 95% of the cohort of adults in HIV care in San Francisco self-reported ART use during MMP interview, they spent on average almost 1 month per year at a transmittable viral level. We identified characteristics of those who were more likely to have higher viral burden, highlighting priorities for resource allocation to reduce onward HIV transmission.

AB  - Introduction: Cigarette smoking is associated with many adverse health effects and is an important public health concern. Increased understanding of smokers' behavior is central to developing effective interventions. Cigarette scavenging, a behavior that involves smoking shared or previously used cigarettes has thus far only been shown to be prevalent among homeless or incarcerated populations. The current study examines whether cigarette scavenging is prevalent in a more general population of adult smokers enrolling in a smoking cessation clinical trial, and whether engagement in this behavior is associated with demographic or smoking-related psychosocial factors.Methods: Baseline data was obtained from adult smokers (N=227) enrolling in a randomized clinical trial for smoking cessation. Cigarette scavenging was assessed using three items: a) sharing a cigarette with a stranger; b) smoking a "found" cigarette and c) smoking a previously used cigarette "butt". Participants who endorsed engaging in at least one of these three behaviors were categorized as a scavenger.Results: Approximately 32% of participants endorsed at least one cigarette scavenging behavior. A multiple logistic regression analysis found that scavengers were more likely to be: men (p<0.001), of younger age at smoking onset (p=0.012), unemployed (p=0.003), more likely to have used marijuana in the past 30days (p=0.005), single or living alone (p=0.003), and to have experienced higher withdrawal symptoms during previous quit attempts (p=0.044) as compared to non-scavengers.Conclusions: Scavenging is common among adult smokers. Interventions that address cigarette scavenging behaviors may better meet the needs of this unique smoking subgroup.

AB  - Although homelessness has frequently been associated with substance abuse, and has been established as a predictor of HIV risk among substance abusers, little is known about the impact of homelessness on HIV risk among female sex workers. This analysis investigated the contribution of homelessness to sexual risk taking among a sample of 485 female sex workers recruited into an HIV prevention programme in Miami, Florida, 41.6% of whom considered themselves to be currently homeless. Findings indicated that in comparison to non-homeless sex workers, significantly more homeless sex workers were daily users of alcohol and crack, and their past month sex work reflected significantly more frequent vaginal and oral sex acts, higher levels of unprotected vaginal sex and more numerous sexual activities while 'high' on drugs. At the same time, a significantly greater proportion of homeless sex workers encountered customers that refused to use condoms than did the non-homeless sex workers. There were no significant differences in HIV seropositivity between the homeless and non-homeless women (22.5 and 24.9%, respectively), primarily because the majority of the women in the study cycled in and out of homelessness.

AB  - Perceptions of health status among 331 homeless veterans and homeless nonveterans were examined. Homeless veterans were significantly less apt to perceive their health as fair/poor (8%) compared to non-veteran homeless men (19%). Homeless veterans were also more likely to report having a regular source of care (57% versus 36%). Logistic regression analysis indicated the adjusted odds of fair/poor health were more than two times greater for persons reporting depressive symptomatology than for those without this history; veterans continue to remain less likely to report fair/poor health than nonveterans. High rates of substance abuse were observed for the entire sample. Such differences in perceived health result in important health access issues.

AB  - Outreach and service linkage are key for engaging marginalized populations, such as homeless youth, in services. Research to date has focused primarily on engaging individuals already receiving some services through emergency shelters, clinics, or other programs. Less is known about those who are not connected to services and, thus, likely the most vulnerable and in need of assistance. The current study sought to engage non-service-connected homeless youth (N = 79) into a strengths-based outreach and advocacy intervention. Youth were randomly assigned to receive 6 months of advocacy that focused on linking youth to a drop-in center (n = 40) or to a crisis shelter (n = 39). All youth were assessed at baseline and 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Findings indicated that youth prefer drop-in center services to the shelter. Also, the drop-in center linkage condition was associated with more service linkage overall (B = 0.34, SE = 0.04, p < 0.01) and better alcohol-l [B = -0.39, SE = 0.09, t(75) = -4.48, p < 0.001] and HIV-related outcomes [B = 0.62, SE = 0.10, t(78) = 6.34, p < 0.001] compared to the shelter linkage condition. Findings highlight the importance of outreach and service linkage for reconnecting service-marginalized youth, and drop-in centers as a primary service option for homeless youth.

AB  - Numerous demographic, socioeconomic, and injury factors influence a burn patient's hospital course. Compared to the typical burn patient, frostbite injury frequently impacts those with high rates of mental illness, substance abuse, and those suffering homelessness. Our aim was to examine differences in the hospital course of frostbite patients compared to those with burns limited to the hands and feet. Patients with frostbite injury and those with isolated hand and/or foot burns were identified in the National Burn Repository. The database was cleaned based on published protocols. Patients were excluded if they had an inhalation injury recorded or unknown. Patients with frostbite injury were significantly older and more likely to be male. Frostbite patients were less frequently covered by commercial insurance (25.3% vs 41.7%). Mean total BSA (TBSA) did not differ between the two groups (frostbite: 2.1 and burn: 1.7, P = .195). The mean intensive care unit (ICU) days and requirement for mechanical ventilation were not significantly different between the two groups, however frostbite patients were significantly more likely to require ICU care (26.5% vs 13.7%, P = .002). Hospital length of stay (LOS) was significantly longer in frostbite patients (8.1 vs 4.0 days, P < .001) and hospital charges were significantly higher in frostbite patients ($43,400 vs $15,600, P < .001). Factors associated with increased hospital charges included mechanism, age, gender, race, TBSA, hospital LOS, ICU, and mechanical ventilation. Factors associated with increased LOS included mechanism, age, gender, race, TBSA, ICU stay, and mechanical ventilation. On multivariate analysis, all factors, except gender, remained independent predictors of increased hospital LOS. A comparison of similarly injured patients treated at burn centers showed frostbite injury as a significant predictor of increased LOS and hospital costs compared to burn-injured patients.

AB  - Despite increased effort to respond to human trafficking at national and state levels, very little empirical research has been conducted on domestic child sex trafficking. This study retrospectively examines associations between multiple risk factors and domestic child sex trafficking (i.e., entry into the commercial sex industry under the age of 18) in a sample of individuals aged 16 and older currently involved in the commercial sex industry (N = 273). Two primary research questions are addressed: (1) What set of risk factors, prior to entering the commercial sex industry, are associated with domestic child sex trafficking and (2) what group differences, if any, exist in risk factors between current or former domestic child sex–trafficking victims and non-trafficked adults engaged in the commercial sex industry? A cross-sectional survey was administered using Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) in five cities in one Midwestern state. Overall, 115 participants (48.3%) were identified as current or former domestic child sex–trafficking victims. Bivariate results suggest that childhood emotional and sexual abuse, rape, ever running away from home, having family members in sex work, and having friends who purchased sex were significantly associated with domestic child sex trafficking. Multivariate results indicate that domestic child sex trafficking victims were significantly more likely to have ever run away and to be a racial/ethnic minority than non-trafficked adults engaged in the commercial sex industry. Findings can inform state-level policies on human trafficking and assist child protection and juvenile justice agencies in developing prevention and intervention responses to commercial sexual exploitation.

AB  - In South Africa, adolescents and young adults (ages 15-24) are at risk of HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and unintended pregnancies. Recently, the Department of Basic Education has revised its sexuality education content and teaching strategies (using scripted lessons plans) as part of its life orientation curriculum. This paper presents the methodology and baseline results from the evaluation of the scripted lesson plans and supporting activities. A rigorous cluster-level randomized design with random assignment of schools as clusters is used for the evaluation. Baseline results from grade 8 female and male learners and grade 10 female learners demonstrate that learners are at risk of HIV and early and unintended pregnancies. Multivariable analyses demonstrate that household-level food insecurity and living with an HIV-positive person are associated with sexual experience and pregnancy experience. Implications are discussed for strengthening the current life orientation program for future scale-up by the government of South Africa.

AB  - Given high levels of health and psychological costs associated with the family disruption of homelessness, identifying predictors of runaway and homeless episodes is an important goal. The current study followed 179 substance abusing, shelter-recruited adolescents who participated in a randomized clinical trial. Predictors of runaway and homeless episodes were examined over a two year period. Results from the hierarchical linear modeling analysis showed that family cohesion and substance use, but not family conflict or depressive symptoms, delinquency, or school enrollment predicted future runaway and homeless episodes. Findings suggest that increasing family support, care and connection and reducing substance use are important targets of intervention efforts in preventing future runaway and homeless episodes amongst a high risk sample of adolescents.

AB  - Background: The most recent statistics indicate that the prevalence of food insecurity in the United States is double that in Canada, but the extent to which the nutrition implications of this problem differ between the countries is not known. Objective: This study was undertaken to compare adequacy of nutrient intakes in relation to household food insecurity among youth and adults in Canada and the United States. Methods: Data from comparable nationally representative surveys, the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey and the 2003-2006 NHANES, were used to estimate prevalences of inadequate intakes of vitamins A and C, folate, calcium, magnesium, and zinc among youth and adults in food-secure and food-insecure households. Potential differences in the composition of the populations between the 2 countries were addressed by using standardization, and analyses also accounted for participation in food and nutrition assistance programs in the United States. Results: Larger gaps in the prevalences of inadequate intakes between those in food-secure and food-insecure households were observed in Canada than in the United States for calcium and magnesium. For calcium, the prevalences of inadequate intakes among those in food-secure and food-insecure households in Canada were 50% and 66%, respectively, compared with 50% and 51%, respectively, in the United States. For magnesium, the prevalences of inadequate intakes in Canada were 39% and 60% among those in food-secure and food-insecure households, respectively, compared with 60% and 61%, respectively, in the United States. These findings were largely unchanged after we accounted for participation in food and nutrition assistance programs in the United States. Conclusions: This study suggests that household food insecurity is a stronger marker of nutritional vulnerability in Canada than in the United States. The results highlight the need for research to elucidate the effects of domestic policies affecting factors such as food prices and fortification on the nutritional manifestations of food insecurity.

AB  - • Condoms were most utilized among those with both serious and casual partners. • The distinction between partner type was found to be greater for YAEH residing in SH. • Those in SH used condoms at higher rates with casual partners, compared to unhoused. • Parents had higher odds of contraceptive use regardless of housing or partner type. Young adults that experience homelessness (YAEH) are at heightened risk of unplanned pregnancy and contracting STIs, including HIV than their housed counterparts. It is unclear how exiting homelessness into Supportive Housing (SH), the most prominent intervention in homelessness, may shape sexual risk-taking. The goal of this study is to explore associations of condom and contraception use with particular interest in the role of partner type (i.e., casual and/or serious) and housing status. This study includes 143 sexually active YAEH (ages 18–27) who reported engaging in vaginal sex during the past three months: 67 "unhoused" (i.e., street-based, couch-surfers, or staying in emergency shelter), and 76 "housed" from SH programs. Multiple logistic regression examined the relationship of housing status and partner type with condom and contraceptive use. Being a parent was associated with higher odds of contraceptive use regardless of housing status, while partner type (i.e., serious or casual partner) was differently associated with condom use by housing status. Despite documented differences in condom-using behaviors by housing status, findings revealed similar patterns in contraceptive use between the two groups, indicating a possible need for enhanced and targeted service planning for YAEH, particularly among those transitioning to and residing in SH, regarding contraceptive use and prevention.

AB  - This study assessed the efficacy of a 4-month program combining motivational interviewing and cognitive behavior intervention on substance-using street adolescents in India. The study followed classical experimental design and the subjects were randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. Readiness to change questionnaire and Adolescent Relapse Coping Questionnaire tools were used for the evaluation of the intervention program. At the baseline, majority of the respondents in both the groups were at the precontemplation stage of motivation. At the end of the 3rd month of the intervention, there was a significant difference, χ2 = 31.139, df = 2, p < .001, between the 2 groups on the stages of motivation. The study’s limitations are noted.

AB  - Research focused on the relationship between place and health demonstrates that it is complex and shifting, as overlapping social, historical, institutional and political and economic processes continually transform the landscapes in which lived experiences are embedded. Understanding this relationship requires knowledge of the situated meanings and local worlds that ethnographic methods are well suited to investigate. However, even conventional ethnographic methods can be inadequate to capture the embodied, lived experience of place - experiences in which the sensory and inner processes of memory and imagination are often privileged. Accessing these experiences and processes can require more experimental methodological approaches. In this article, I present work from a series of photo essays created between 2011 and 2016 by 15 young people who inhabit the social, spatial and economic margins of Vancouver, Canada, and discuss some of the challenges and opportunities presented by this methodology. Created over 5 years, and broadly focused on how they understood, experienced and navigated their 'place' in the city in the midst of poverty, addiction, violence and physical and mental health crises, the photo essays young people produced are embedded with personal biographies and trajectories, as well as shared experiences of geography, precarity and possibility in Vancouver.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to better understand the prevalence and correlates of substance use behaviors among HIV-infected adolescents in HIV care settings.Methods: A cross-sectional sample of 2216 youth living with HIV (YLWH; ages 12-26) were recruited through the Adolescent Trials Network for HIV Interventions. Participants completed a one-time survey on sociodemographic factors, substance use and health behaviors. We used logistic regression models to understand the correlates of substance use outcomes.Results: Overall, weekly or more frequent tobacco use was reported by 32.9% of participants, 27.5% marijuana use, and 21.3% alcohol use; and 22.5% reported any other illicit drug use. In multivariable models, young MSM had higher odds of reporting each substance use behavior, and transgender women had increased odds of marijuana and other illicit drug use. Criminal justice involvement, unstable housing, condomless sex, and suboptimal antiretroviral therapy was associated with increased risk of substance use behaviors.Conclusions: Study findings highlight the need for regular screening for substance use in HIV care settings in order to improve access to and delivery of culturally competent substance use prevention and treatment services.

AB  - Aims: To follow-up hospitalization for physical diseases among homeless men and women compared with a control group from the general population. The study also investigated the changes in the difference between the homeless men and women and the general population over time by comparing two cohorts of homeless people (2000–2002 and 1996). Methods: A total of 3887 people (24% women) who were homeless during the period 2000–2002 were compared with 11,661 people from the general population with respect to hospitalization for physical diseases and injuries (2000–2010). Indirect comparisons were used to compare the relative risk (RR) of hospitalization between the cohort of people who were homeless in 2000–2002 with a cohort of those who were homeless in 1996. Results: Homeless people have an RR of being hospitalized for physical diseases twice that of the general population. The largest differences were found in skin diseases, infections, injury/poisoning and diseases of the respiratory system. Indirect comparison between people who were homeless in 2000–2002 and 1996 showed an increasing difference between young (18–35 years) homeless men and men in the control group (RR 1.32). The difference had also increased between homeless men and men in the control group for hospitalization for heart disease (RR 1.35), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR 2.60) and poisoning (RR 1.89). Among women, the difference had decreased between homeless women and women in the control group for skin disease (RR 0.20) and injury/poisoning (RR 0.60). There was no significant difference between the sexes in the two homeless cohorts. Conclusions: There was no improvement in excess hospitalization among homeless people over time. The difference between young homeless men and young men in the general population increased between 1996 and 2000–2002.

AB  - Aims This paper examines differences between early- and late-onset injection drug users (12-16 years versus 17-24 years) in terms of the antecedents and circumstances of first injection. Design Cross-sectional retrospective design, using logistic regression. Setting Australia: Sydney, Brisbane, rural New South Wales. Participants A total of 336 injection drug users aged 16-25 years at the time of interview. Measurements Independent variables included family injection drug use, homelessness and other demographic variables, drugs used prior to the first injection, length of pre-injection drug career, behaviours at time of first injection (e.g. drug injected, reasons/motives for the first injection, risk behaviours). Findings Early-onset injection was associated independently with: having a family who injected drugs, having left school early, an unreliable source of income, a short pre-injection drug career, planning of the first injection, reliance on others for administration of the first injection and denial that experimentation was the motive for the first injection. In bivariate analysis, early-onset injection was associated further with: homelessness, being an Indigenous Australian, omission of use of certain pre-injection drugs, group presence at first injection, reliance on others for acquisition of the first needle and syringe and having injected the first time because an injection was offered. Conclusions The research shows that early-onset, compared with late-onset injectors, are more likely to have an immediate family who inject drugs and other problematic beginnings in early life. They have an accelerated transition to injection, and differences in autonomy and motivation at first injection. These characteristics may make them more vulnerable to risk taking.

AB  - Background: Alcohol is the leading psychoactive substance consumed in France, with about 15 million regular consumers. The National institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) considers alcohol abuse to be more than 14 units of alcohol a week for men and 7 units for women. The specific complication of alcoholism is the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Its incidence reaches up to 30 % and its main complications are delirium tremens, restlessness, extended hospital stay, higher morbidity, and psychiatric and cognitive impairment. Without appropriate treatment, delirium tremens can lead to death in up to 50 % of patients.Methods/design: This prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled study versus placebo will be conducted in twelve French intensive care units (ICU). Patients with an alcohol intake level higher than the NIAAA threshold, who are under mechanical ventilation, will be included. The primary objective is to determine whether baclofen is more efficient than placebo in preventing restlessness-related side effects in the ICU. Secondary outcomes include mechanical ventilation duration, length of ICU stay, and cumulative doses of sedatives and painkillers received within 28 days of ICU admission. Restlessness-related side effects in the ICU are defined as unplanned extubation, medical disposal removal (such as urinary catheter, venous or arterial line or surgical drain), falling out of bed, ICU runaway (leaving ICU without physician's approval), immobilisation device removal, self-aggression or aggression towards medical staff. Daily doses of baclofen/placebo will be guided by daily creatinine clearance assessment.Discussion: Restlessness in alcoholic patients is a life-threatening issue in ICUs. BACLOREA is a randomised study assessing the capacity of baclofen to prevent agitation in mechanically ventilated patients. Enrolment of 314 patients will begin in June 2016 and is expected to end in October 2018.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723383 , registered on 3 March 2016.

AB  - This study examined gender differences among homeless young adults' engagement in illegal economic activity (i.e., panhandling, selling drugs, survival sex, gambling, theft). A purposive sample of 601 homeless young adults (ages 18–24) was recruited from three U.S. cities (Los Angeles, CA [ n = 200], Austin, TX [ n = 200], and Denver, CO [ n = 201]) to participate in semi-structured interviews. General strain theory was used to identify predictors of illegal economic activity, including strains (childhood abuse, street victimization, length of homelessness, transience) and responses to strain (deviant peer associations, substance use, post-traumatic stress disorder, arrest history). The full hypothesized path models for males and females separately were tested using observed-variable path analysis. Among females, a greater variety of illegal income sources was reported by those who had experienced greater street victimization and who had used a greater number of substances in the past year. Among males, a greater variety of illegal income sources was reported by those who had more deviant peer associations, experienced greater street victimization, and used a greater number of substances in the past year. Findings have implications for research and preventive interventions to address engagement in illegal economic activity among male and female homeless young adults.

AB  - Street-involved (SI) youth represent a significant proportion of urban homeless populations. While previous research has identified SI youth as substantial users of emergency department (ED) services and has examined their experiences of ED care, little is known about the experiences and perceptions of the service providers who assist these youth with health care related issues. Using grounded theory, individual interviews and focus groups were conducted with 20 community agency staff serving SI youth, 17 health service providers, two hospital administrators, and two hospital security personnel regarding their experiences in providing or facilitating ED care for SI youth. Results identify differences in expectations between SI youth and hospital staff, along with service issues and gaps, including relational barriers and resource constraints. Implications for practice and policy development are offered.

AB  - Background. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that the newest latent tuberculosis (LTBI) regimen, 12 weekly doses of directly observed isoniazid and rifapentine (3HP), is as efficacious as 9 months of isoniazid, with a greater completion rate (82% vs 69%); however, 3HP has not been assessed in routine healthcare settings. Methods. Observational cohort of LTBI patients receiving 3HP through 16 US programs was used to assess treatment completion, adverse drug reactions, and factors associated with treatment discontinuation. Results. Of 3288 patients eligible to complete 3HP, 2867 (87.2%) completed treatment. Children aged 2-17 years had the highest completion rate (94.5% [155/164]). Patients reporting homelessness had a completion rate of 81.2% (147/181). In univariable analyses, discontinuation was lowest among children (relative risk [RR], 0.44 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .23-.85]; P = .014), and highest in persons aged =65 years (RR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.25-2.35]; P < .001). In multivariable analyses, discontinuation was lowest among contacts of patients with tuberculosis (TB) disease (adjusted RR [ARR], 0.68 [95% CI, .52-.89]; P = .005) and students (ARR, 0.45 [95% CI, .21-.98]; P = .044), and highest with incarceration (ARR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.08-1.89]; P = .013) and homelessness (ARR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.25-2.39]; P = .001). Adverse drug reactions were reported by 1174 (35.7%) patients, of whom 891 (76.0%) completed treatment. Conclusions. Completion of 3HP in routine healthcare settings was greater overall than rates reported from clinical trials, and greater than historically observed using other regimens among reportedly nonadherent populations. Widespread use of 3HP for LTBI treatment could accelerate elimination of TB disease in the United States.

AB  - Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is to describe the attempts by one youth homelessness service to implement the conceptual ideas of the psychologically informed environment (PIE) into a practical and beneficial service for very challenging young people who have been homeless, are leaving care or have left custody. Design/methodology/approach -- The approach of the paper is descriptive, outlining the thinking behind a PIE with young people and the operationalising of this understanding in the day-to-day practice of the service. Findings -- Although homelessness and housing support staff are not therapists, the nature of the work entails a need for understanding and sensitivity, and the activities of the service are designed to create positive opportunities and relationships. Reflective practice, supervision and evaluation are then essential tools in developing a 'learning organisation', where the collective dynamics at an organisational level support the psychological work of the PIE. Research limitations/implications -- The implications for homelessness work that can be drawn from the outcome of this project is to better understand how the PIE linked to the concept of a learning organisation can provide a truly robust framework for providing a service that can evolve harmoniously, tying in disparate funding streams to offer very challenging young people an outstanding service that addresses their homelessness and its underlying causes. Practical implications -- The practical implications shown are the psychological skills that can be developed in housing workers; the limits of those skills and how they are complemented by partnership work with other voluntary sector organisations and mainstream health providers; how the ideas of the learning organisation can naturally underpin the work of the PIE. Originality/value -- The combination of the concept of the learning organisation, reflective practice and the PIE provides a highly original and truly robust framework for providing housing workers with the psychological tools to make a transformative difference in the lives of especially vulnerable young homeless people.

AB  - This study evaluated the impact of housing services among child welfare--involved families using observational data. Propensity score matching with data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being compared intact families (n = 183) who received housing services 12 months after initial investigation to nontreated families balanced on characteristics at the time of investigation. Results suggested that general housing services failed, on average, to effectively address the needs of inadequately housed families.

AB  - Aims: To qualitatively evaluate the optimal intervention (food-voucher approach vs. free daily meal distribution), aimed at reducing food insecurity and promoting healthy eating among students attending public schools in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.Methods: We randomly assigned 34 schools to one of the two interventions: students in 17 schools received a daily lunch-box and parents in the other 17 schools received a food voucher of equal value once a month. All students were offered the opportunity to participate. We conducted 30 focus groups in all participating schools (17 in the meal distribution and 13 in the food voucher schools). Eligible participants included parents (n = 106), educators (n = 66) and school principals (n = 34). We qualitatively evaluated their perceptions and attitudes towards the program.Results: Important differences were observed between the two approaches, with more favourable perceptions being reported for the meal distribution approach. More specifically, social stigmatization was minimized in the meal distribution approach, through the participation of all students, compared with the food-voucher participants who reported feelings of embarrassment and fear of stigmatization. Secondly, the meal distribution approach alleviated child food insecurity through the provision of the daily meal, while the food-voucher intervention helped manage household food insecurity, as vouchers were mainly used for purchasing food for family meals. Furthermore, the educational and experiential nature of the meal distribution approach intensified healthy eating promotion, while the food-voucher intervention was efficient mainly for conscious parents regarding healthy eating.Conclusions: The meal distribution intervention was considered more effective than the food-voucher one. Hence, for interventions aiming at tackling food insecurity of children and adolescents, public health focus could be oriented towards school-based in kind food assistance.

AB  - Eligible adolescents (12-17 years old) were recruited from a short-term crisis shelter for runaway adolescents in a large Midwestern city. Adolescents (N = 179) were randomly assigned to Ecologically-Based Family Therapy (EBFT, n = 61), the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA, n = 57), or brief Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET, n = 61) with the primary focus on substance abuse. A significant increase in perceived family cohesion and a significant reduction in perceived family conflict were found among all treatment conditions from baseline to the 24-month follow-up. Adolescents who received EBFT demonstrated more improvement in family cohesion after treatment than those who received CRA or MET, and more reduction in family conflict during treatment than those who received MET.

AB  - Childhood maltreatment and interpersonal trauma experience is an important factor underpinning the apparent perpetuation of the cycle of social disadvantage experienced by homeless adults. This paper aimed to examine longitudinal patterns of psychological distress in a sample of 1,504 socially disadvantaged adult participants from the Journeys Home Study in Australia. The current paper utilized the "conservation of resources" theory and the concept of "risk factor caravans" to investigate the nature and implications of childhood trauma in the context of homelessness. Growth mixture modeling revealed four distinct trajectories of psychological distress as measured by the Kessler 6 across six time points (covering a period of 2.5 years): chronic, escalating, attenuating, and resistant. Our results also indicated that experiences of different types of trauma during childhood were associated with these psychological distress trajectories. In particular, adults experiencing chronic psychological distress were significantly more likely than those exhibiting distress resistance to have experienced multiple and varied childhood maltreatment, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.30, 95% CI [0.37, 6.05], p = .002. Furthermore, adult experiences of assault were found to be associated with psychological distress. These findings have important implications for mental health, as well as interventions aimed at breaking the cycle of urban poverty. Specific focus on interpersonal trauma vulnerabilities is important. Prioritizing socioecological stability, with mental health needs assessed on an individual level, may be most appropriate. This work also highlights the need to direct future attention to barriers to access and facilitation of social support services.
AB  - Resumen: Spanish Abstracts by the Asociación Chilena de Estrés Traumático (ACET) Trayectorias del Malestar Psicológico* en Australianos Viviendo en Pobreza Urbana. El Impacto del Trauma Interpersonal MALESTAR PSICOLOGICO Y TRAUMA INTERPERSONAL La experiencia de maltrato infantil y trauma interpersonal es un factor importante sustentando la aparente perpetuación del ciclo de desventaja social experimentada por adultos en situación de calle. Este artículo busca examinar los patrones longitudinales de malestar psicológico en una muestra de 1,504 participantes adultos en desventaja social del Journeys Home Study en Australia. El presente artículo utilizó la teoría de conservación de recursos y el concepto de caravanas de factores de riesgo para investigar la naturaleza e implicaciones del trauma infantil en el contexto de situación de calle. El modelo mixto de crecimiento reveló cuatro trayectorias distintivas de malestar psicológico como es medido por el Kessler 6 en los seis puntos de tiempo (cubriendo un periodo de 2.5 años): crónico, escalando, atenuado, resistente. Nuestros resultados también indicaron que las experiencias de diferentes tipos de trauma durante la infancia fueron asociadas con estas trayectorias de malestar psicológico. En particular, los adultos que experimentan malestar psicológico crónico fueron significativamente más propensos que aquellos que exhibían resistencia al malestar psicológico de haber experimentado múltiples y variadas formas de maltrato infantil, proporción de probabilidades ajustadas (AOR en sus siglas en inglés) = 5.75, p = .002, 95% CI [2.37, 9.19]. Además, las experiencias adultas de asalto/agresión estaban asociadas con malestar psicológico. Estos hallazgos tienen implicaciones importantes para la salud mental y para las intervenciones orientadas a romper el ciclo de la pobreza urbana. El foco específico en las vulnerabilidades de trauma interpersonal es importante. Priorizar la estabilidad socioecológica, con las necesidades de salud mental evaluadas a nivel individual sería lo más apropiado. Este trabajo también enfatiza la necesidad de dirigir la atención futura a las barreras de acceso y facilitación de servicios de apoyo social. * Psychological distress en el original en inglés.

AB  - • A small number of studies showed reductions in youth homelessness. • A few evaluations showed effectiveness in preventing homelessness. • Most evaluations measured counseling and short-term well-being outcomes. • We need more rigorous evidence on shelter, housing, and outreach models. • There is little evidence on program effects for specific subpopulations (e.g., according to race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender identity) or contexts (e.g., rural). This systematic review synthesizes effectiveness evidence on interventions to prevent and address youth homelessness. It was conducted primarily for a United States policy and practice audience but involved an international synthesis of evidence. We conducted an international search that included eleven major academic electronic databases, 13 additional relevant institutional web-based publication databases, and a professional outreach for published and unpublished studies of the effectiveness of programs and practices to prevent or address youth homelessness, in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. We searched databases for studies published or completed between January 1, 2008 and March 19, 2019, and we also reviewed earlier studies synthesized in a similar past systematic review that ended its search in 2008. The review included experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation studies of youth ages 13–25. We included studies that only used pre-post comparisons and denote lower rigor designs clearly in the synthesis. The search identified 4,387 potentially relevant unique publications. After screening, 66 publications representing 53 unique studies of 54 different interventions remained and were included in this review. The vast majority (83%) of unique studies were conducted in the U.S. Of the 53 unique studies, 22 (42%) involved some type of randomized evaluation. Many studies involved low rigor designs with weak counterfactuals, small sample sizes, and short follow-up periods. Included studies evaluated a range of interventions, and we grouped these into seven broad categories. The largest evidence base on the effectiveness of interventions relates to counseling and treatment interventions to address mental health or health risk behaviors. Overall, these studies showed promising results, but few included long-term follow-up. A small number of studies demonstrated reductions in occurrence of youth homelessness and housing instability, including some intensive case management and support interventions without direct housing assistance components. The field lacks rigorous evaluative evidence of many of the program models on which communities and governments rely to address youth homelessness (for example, street outreach, transitional living programs, youth shelters, host homes, and rapid rehousing). Evaluative evidence is further lacking on how the effects of interventions vary by subpopulations disproportionately impacted by homelessness. Policy and community interventions to prevent and end youth homelessness require a robust evidence base to inform decision-making. This systematic review presents an important starting point to inform solutions across a range of intervention areas, and it reveals significant areas in which investments in research and evaluation are urgently needed.

AB  - Despite many similarities, there are key differences in the ability of providers in the United States to assist homeless youth compared to their colleagues in the United Kingdom. However, legislation, and strategies to identify and advocate for youth experiencing homelessness can lead to improved health outcomes and other psychosocial improvements for youth. This article highlights, compares and contrasts the systems with a goal of greater understanding and opportunities to assist youth experiencing homelessness in either country.

AB  - Purpose Several risk factors have been identified in ongoing efforts by the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to mitigate high rates of homelessness among veterans. To date, no studies have examined the relationship of rurality and distance to nearest VA facility to risk of homelessness. Due to challenges in accessing available services, the hypothesis was that rural-residing veterans are at greater risk for homelessness. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approach The cohort consisted of veterans who had separated from the military between 2001 and 2011. The authors used a forwarding address provided by the service member at the time of separation from the military to determine rurality of residence and distance to care. The authors examined differences in the rate of homelessness within a year of a veteran’s first encounter with the VA following last military separation based on rurality and distance to the nearest VA facility using multivariable log-binomial regressions.Findings In the cohort of 708,318 veterans, 84.3 percent were determined to have a forwarding address in urban areas, 60.4 and 88.7 percent lived within 40 miles of the nearest VA medical center (VAMC), respectively. Veterans living in a rural area (RR=0.763; 95 percent CI=0.718-0.810) and those living between 20 and 40 miles (RR=0.893; 95 percent CI=0.846-0.943) and 40+ miles away from the nearest VAMC (RR=0.928; 95 percent CI=0.879-0.979) were at a lower risk for homelessness.Originality/value The unique data set allowed the authors to explore the relationship between geography and homelessness. These results are important to VA and national policy makers in understanding the risk factors for homelessness among veterans and planning interventions.

AB  - Background: This study investigates nutritional behavior among adolescents and young adults with bipolar disorder (BP) in comparison to those without history of major psychiatric disorder.Methods: 131 participants (82 BP, 49 controls) with a mean age of 16.11 ± 1.61 years were included. The self-reported Quick Weight, Activity, Variety & Excess (WAVE) Screener was used to assess dietary habits, yielding a total nutritional score as well as Excess, Variety, and Household Food Insecurity subscale scores. Specifically, the Variety subscale was used to measure daily consumption of essential nutrients; the Excess subscale measured unhealthy eating behaviors such as binge eating and excessive intake of fat and sugar; and the Household Food Insecurity subscale was used to detect food insecurity. Within-group analysis was conducted on participants with BP to identify correlates of unhealthy diet.Results: BP participants scored significantly lower than controls on the WAVE (t=2.62, p=0.010), specifically the Excess subscale (t=3.26, p=0.001). This was related to higher prevalence of binge eating and emotional eating behaviors among participants with BP compared to controls. Within-group analyses showed that self-reported emotional dysregulation/impulsivity was associated with maladaptive nutritional behaviors (t=3.38, p=0.035).Limitations: Cross-sectional design. Within-group analyses were underpowered. Diet quality was measured using a brief self-report screener.Conclusion: Adolescents and young adults with BP have poorer nutritional behaviors compared to controls, and this difference is related to stress-induced eating. This demonstrates the need to screen for stress-induced eating and to intervene when needed in order to optimize nutritional behaviors among adolescents and young adults with BP.

AB  - The current study implemented and evaluated a 12-week Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) intervention across two Canadian service agencies providing drop-in, shelter and transitional housing to street-involved youth in order to alleviate mental health challenges and to strengthen resilience. A quasi-experimental mixed methods design with a wait-list comparison was used. Overall results demonstrate that youth who received the DBT intervention (N = 60) demonstrated significant improvement in mental health challenges (e.g. depression, hopelessness, and anxiety), as well as significant improvement in resilience, self-esteem, and social connectedness immediately post-intervention. Participants in the wait-list control did not demonstrate significant improvement on any of the study outcome measures. Furthermore, the gains attained for the intervention group were sustained at four and 10 weeks post-intervention. The qualitative data substantiates these findings; further shedding light on youth's perspectives regarding the impetus for engaging in DBT, the experience of DBT and the impact DBT had on their lives. Results of this study suggests that DBT implemented by front-line clinicians shows promise in meeting the needs of street-involved youth in the community. Moreover, this study demonstrates that it is possible, with the right approach and support, for an interdisciplinary team of youth workers, nurses, and social workers to implement an evidenced-based treatment with youth at community agencies thereby increasing access to needed services to support youth in ultimately exiting the street.

AB  - Abstract: Purpose: To explore whether gender differences in sexual risk and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among homeless youth may be explained in part by gender differences in their social networks. Methods: Our sample includes 258 youth (64% male) recruited in San Francisco from street venues and transitional programs. Participants completed an audio computer-administered self-interview survey regarding their housing status and risk behaviors and an interviewer-administered survey regarding their social networks, and were tested for STIs (chlamydia and gonorrhea). We examined relationships between sexual risk and STI rates and social network characteristics by gender. Results: Condom use was lower in young women than in young men, whereas young women were more likely to have an injection drug user (IDU) sex partner and to be diagnosed with an STI. Homeless young men were more likely to have stably housed contacts and same-sex friendships in their social networks than were young women. Stably housed network contacts were associated with increased condom use and decreased STI prevalence in young men. Same-sex friends were associated with increased condom use in young women. No young woman with a family member in her network had an IDU sex partner. Having a network member who had been recently incarcerated was associated with having an IDU sex partner for young women. Conclusions: Homeless young women's networks may place them at greater risk for STIs than young men. Increasing mainstream contacts and same-gender friendships may protect all homeless youth from STIs. Interventions addressing homeless young women's social networks may decrease their gender-disparate STI risk.

AB  - Background: Prior studies have shown that Group Motivational Interviewing (GMI) for dually diagnosed patients holds promise for increasing treatment engagement.Objectives: The current study evaluated the impact of a novel GMI protocol that included tobacco-specific components (referred to as "Tobacco GMI or T-GMI") targeting enhanced engagement in smoking cessation treatment.Methods: Thirty-seven primary alcohol and nicotine-dependent cigarette smoking homeless Veterans with co-morbid psychiatric conditions were recruited to receive four GMI sessions over 4 consecutive days. The first 16 participants received standard GMI, aimed at enhancing engagement in substance abuse treatment and for reducing substance use, while the remaining 21 participants received a modified "tobacco-specific" GMI protocol (T-GMI) that included additional content specific to cessation of tobacco use and enhancing smoking cessation treatment, in addition to the standard substance abuse content of GMI.Results: Participants in T-GMI were more likely to attend tobacco cessation programming (p = .05), as well as to attend combined tobacco cessation programming with prescribed nicotine replacement therapy (p = .03), compared to those in standard GMI. Differences between treatment conditions with respect to alcohol and illicit drug use outcomes were not significant, although overall substance use declined over time in both groups.Conclusions and Scientific Significance: Results suggest that inclusion of tobacco-specific components in the context of GMI for substance abuse may enhance treatment engagement for tobacco cessation behaviors among dually diagnosed nicotine dependent homeless patients, a highly vulnerable population for which interventional resources targeting engagement in smoking cessation treatment has historically been lacking.

AB  - We assessed gender differences in psychosocial and behavioural predictors of HIV testing and returning for results in a high-risk sample of 1,049 predominately minority, impoverished, homeless and/or drug-abusing women (n = 621) and men (n = 428). Predictors included latent variables representing injection drug use, self-esteem, social support, AIDS knowledge, poor access to health services, perceived risk for AIDS, sexual risk behaviour and the mediators of positive and negative coping styles. Significant predictors of test and return for women included injection drug use, greater social support, more AIDS knowledge, a higher perceived risk for AIDS and a positive coping style. Significant predictors for the men included injection drug use, greater AIDS knowledge, a higher perceived risk for AIDS and a positive coping style. Although greater social support was not significant for the men, the significant predictors of HIV testing and return were generally similar for the men and women. However, the men evaluated their risk of AIDS significantly lower than the women, although they reported more sexual risk behaviours and equally risky injection drug use behaviours. Results suggest that interventions designed to increase AIDS knowledge, to raise the perception of risk and to promote a positive coping style would be effective in encouraging more HIV testing for both men and women, but raising perceptions of what constitutes personal risk behaviours may need special emphasis when delivering prevention programmes to men.

AB  - This study aimed to identify homeless youths’ lifestyle and trauma-related risk factors as well as protective factors associated with alcohol use disorder or no disorder and drug use disorder or no disorder. Youth receiving homeless services in Denver (n= 201), Austin (n= 200), and Los Angeles (n= 200;N= 601) completed quantitative interviews assessing demographic information, alcohol and drug use, homeless lifestyle risk factors, trauma-related risk factors, and protective factors. Findings showed differences in trauma-related risk factors between alcohol and drug use disorders, but not homeless lifestyle risks. Protective factors predicted substance use disorders beyond risk factors. Understanding trauma-related risk and protective factors associated with substance use disorders could improve interventions.

AB  - Problem Street-involved youth experience many barriers to accessing health and social services. There is a literature gap in the literature regarding evidence-based interventions to facilitate engagement with street-involved youth. Methods A qualitative descriptive study of preliminary findings from a large mixed-methods study was undertaken to assess the impact of a resilience-based motivational intervention. This intervention was grounded in frameworks including strengths-based and resilience-based communication using the Seven C's Model of Resilience, positive youth development, and motivational interviewing that are particularly relevant to youth. Individual interviews were conducted with two subsets of youth who participated ( n = 3) or did not participate ( n = 3) in the intervention. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify themes between the intervention and comparison groups. Findings Preliminary themes identified across the sample include (1) establishing a trusting relationship, (2) strengthening self-worth and resilience, (3) focusing on goals, and (4) perceiving a sense of hope and possibility. Conclusions The themes identified the importance of positive relationships with care providers built upon a foundation of trust to engage youth to remain motivated and focused on their goals.

AB  - Research indicates that dispositional attachment security fosters empathy, and that short-term increases in security ("security priming") increase empathy and willingness to help others. In two experiments, we examined effects of recalling one's own vulnerability ( feeling hurt by a relationship partner) and security priming on empathy for a recipient in need. In Study 1, the recipient was a middle-aged homeless woman (low similarity to participants); in Study 2, the recipient was a college-aged woman whose boyfriend had been unfaithful (high similarity to participants). In both studies, hurt feelings influenced participants' empathy, but the nature of the influence varied as a function of target-participant similarity. In Study 1, hurt feelings decreased empathy and increased caregiving avoidance. In Study 2, hurt feelings not only increased empathy but also aroused caregiving anxiety. Furthermore, security priming weakened defensive barriers against helping: In Study 1, it reduced caregiving avoidance, and in Study 2, it reduced caregiving anxiety.

AB  - • LGBQ youth were more likely to identify as female, have experienced sexual victimization, and reported greater mental health needs. • The average length of stay for youth in this study was slightly less than 5 months. • All youth regardless of LGBQ identity, on average, underutilized available services. Homeless youth who identity as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer (LGBTQ) face considerable issues including victimization, mental health needs, and substance use, yet are less likely than their heterosexual homeless peers to utilize services. Although research in this area is growing, studies tend to focus on the experiences and service use of homeless youth in drop-in or emergency shelters, instead of longer-term transitional living programs (TLPs). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to expand the homeless youth literature by examining differences in sociodemographic characteristics, victimization, mental health, and substance use histories, and service utilization patterns of homeless youth by LGBQ identity (LGBQ vs. non-LGBQ) in a TLP. We extracted secondary data from closed case files of homeless youth (N = 101) ages 16–20 who accessed services in a mid-Michigan TLP between 2011 and 2018. Using independent sample t-tests and Chi-square, we assessed patterns by LGBQ. Results indicate that LGBQ homeless youth were more likely than their non-LGBQ homeless peers to identify as female, report being sexually victimized, and have greater mental health-related needs. All youth, but especially LGBQ youth underutilized available services, resulting in greater unmet mental health needs. These findings confirm the vulnerability of LGBQ homeless youth in TLPs and provide essential information regarding service utilization for homeless youth practitioners, including the need for trauma-informed and LGBTQ-specific services. Additionally, the data suggest that service providers must encourage youth engagement in services offered within TLPs.

AB  - Background: Household food insecurity (HFI) can lead to a poor diet and malnutrition. Yet, little is known about the extent to which maternal diet covaries with food insecurity during pregnancy and lactation.Objective: Longitudinal associations between HFI and maternal dietary diversity from early pregnancy to 3 mo postpartum were examined in rural Bangladesh.Methods: We repeatedly assessed dietary intake by using a 7-d food-frequency questionnaire in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy and at 3 mo postpartum among 14,600 women enrolled into an antenatal micronutrient supplementation trial. Maternal dietary diversity score (DDS) was constructed as the sum of 10 food groups reportedly consumed at each assessment. Households were classified at 6 mo postpartum as being food secure or having mild, moderate, or severe HFI on the basis of a 9-item standard scale. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate the longitudinal relation between HFI status and DDS and the likelihood of individual food-group consumption, adjusting for confounders at the maternal and household levels.Results: The DDS decreased with progressively worse HFI, an association best explained by a derived household wealth index. Compared with women from food-secure households, women of mild, moderate, and severe HFI were less likely, in a dose-response fashion, to have consumed dairy products [adjusted ORs (95% CIs): 0.73 (0.69, 0.78), 0.62 (0.58, 0.66), and 0.52 (0.48, 0.55), respectively], eggs [0.81 (0.76, 0.85), 0.73 (0.68, 0.77), and 0.61 (0.57, 0.65)], meat [0.83 (0.79, 0.88), 0.73 (0.69, 0.78), and 0.60 (0.56, 0.64)], fish [0.87 (0.80, 0.94), 0.76 (0.70, 0.83), and 0.59 (0.54, 0.65)], legumes and nuts [0.88 (0.83, 0.93), 0.81 (0.76, 0.87), and 0.79 (0.74, 0.85)], and yellow and orange fruit and vegetables [0.85 (0.80, 0.91), 0.78 (0.73, 0.84), and 0.72 (0.67, 0.78)]. Neither intakes of dark-green leafy vegetables nor of vegetable oil were associated with HFI status.Conclusion: Antenatal and postnatal maternal dietary diversity, especially intakes of animal-source foods, fruit, and vegetables, declined with worsening food insecurity in rural Bangladesh.

AB  - Although studies suggest that informal helping among poor people keeps millions off the streets of America, very little is known about self-help strategies and resources that exist among poor households and their role in the prevention of homelessness. This study examines the characteristics of homeless people who double up with their friends and relatives. It also examines their relationships with those who house them. Survey data revealed differences in the helping strategies and resources of those who double up. The respondents' sex, race, presence of children, and dependence on public assistance appear to influence the opportunities to double up with friends or relatives. Recommendations are made to enchance the living conditions among doubled-up households so they may continue to serve as a foundation in the prevention of homelessness. Although our primary focus is on the homeless population, policy recommendations include ways to help the low-income households that shelter them as well.

AB  - While there is a growing body of research on intimate partner violence (IPV) experienced by the housed youth population, a limited amount is known about IPV experienced by homeless youth. To our knowledge, no previous studies have examined how homeless youths’ experience of IPV is related to their social network, even though the social networks of homeless youth have been shown to be significant indicators of health and mental health. The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship between IPV, gender, and social networks among a sample of 386 homeless youth in Los Angeles, California. Results revealed that one fifth of the sample experienced IPV in the past year. Stratified regression models revealed that IPV was not significantly related to any measure of male social networks; however, females who experienced IPV had more male friends (β = 2.03, SE = 0.89, p < .05) than females who did not experience IPV. Female homeless youth who witnessed family violence during childhood had more male friends (β = 2.75, SE = 1.08, p < .05), but those who experienced sexual abuse during childhood had fewer male friends (β = −2.04, SE = 0.93, p < .05). Although there was no significant difference in the rate of IPV victimization across genders, the context of this abuse appears to be drastically different. The results suggest that females with more male friendships are at greater risk for exposure to IPV. To date, there are few effective youth-targeted IPV prevention programs and none have been shown to be effective with homeless youth. These results provide insight into future program development.

AB  - Background: New Zealand has the second highest youth suicide rate in the OECD and particularly among Pacific New Zealanders, who have a threefold higher risk of suicide attempt compared with the general population.Aims: Protective and risk factors for suicide attempts among New Zealand Pacific adolescents were assessed using data from Youth'12, an adolescent health and well-being survey.Method: This randomly selected nationally representative sample of New Zealand secondary school students included 1,445 Pacific high school students aged 12-17 years.Results: One in 10 (11.6%) Pacific adolescents reported attempting suicide. Risk factors for suicide included: being female, household food insecurity, low levels of family connections and family monitoring, life dissatisfaction, having a religious affiliation, and previous suicide by a family member or friend. Of those who had made a suicide attempt, 71% also experienced both suicide ideation and self-harm.Conclusion: This study suggests that given the high rates of suicide ideation and attempts among Pacific young people, targeted trials for new ways of support should be prioritized for this high-risk group. The Pacific family environment, which continues to be the critical space for intervening, and the school environment, as a provider of health services, were both protective of suicide attempt.

AB  - This study compared baseline characteristics of Black Americans and Caucasians with first-episode psychosis in the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode Early Treatment Program (RAISE-ETP). Black American (N=152) and Caucasian (N=218) participants were compared on demographic, psychosocial, clinical, and neurocognitive measures. Results indicated several notable racial differences in baseline characteristics: a greater proportion of Black Americans than Caucasians were female, and Black Americans reported less personal and parental education than Caucasians. Black Americans were also less likely to have private insurance, more likely to be homeless or transient, had significantly poorer quality of life, more severe disorganized symptoms, worse neurocognition, and were less likely to abuse alcohol than Caucasians. The implications of these findings are discussed, and suggestions are provided for future avenues of treatment and research on racial disparities in first-episode psychosis.

AB  - Objective: In a cluster randomized controlled trial, this study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of and fidelity to Houvast (Dutch for "grip"), a strengths-based intervention to improve the quality of life for homeless young adults.Methods: Fidelity was measured six months after professionals and team leaders at five Dutch shelters for homeless young adults finished their training in Houvast. Fidelity was measured with the Dutch version of the strengths model fidelity scale, which consists of ten indicators distributed across three subscales: structure, supervision, and clinical practice. A total fidelity score was composed by averaging the ten indicator scores for each facility. During one-day audits by two trained assessors visiting each facility, a file analysis (N=46), a focus group with homeless young adults (N=19), and interviews with the team leader and supervisor (N=9) were conducted. Professionals, supervisors, and team leaders completed questionnaires two weeks before the audit (N=43). In addition, an evaluation of the audit was conducted six months later.Results: Although none of the five shelters achieved a sufficient total model fidelity score, median scores on caseload, group supervision, and strengths assessment were satisfactory. Each facility received a report with a set of recommendations to improve model fidelity. The evaluation showed improvements in use of the strengths assessment and personal recovery plans and in supervision.Conclusions: Facilities face several challenges when implementing a new intervention, and implementing Houvast was no exception. Learning experiences and possible explanations for the insufficient total fidelity scores are reported.

AB  - Chronically homeless individuals with alcohol dependence experience severe alcohol-related consequences. It is therefore important to identify factors that might be associated with reduced alcohol-related harm, such as the use of safer-drinking strategies. Whereas effectiveness of safer-drinking strategies has been well-documented among young adults, no studies have explored this topic among more severely affected populations, such as chronically homeless individuals with alcohol dependence. The aims of this study were thus to qualitatively and quantitatively document safer-drinking strategies used in this population. Participants (N=31) were currently or formerly chronically homeless individuals with alcohol dependence participating in a pilot study of extended-release naltrexone and harm-reduction counseling. At weeks 0 and 8, research staff provided a list of safer-drinking strategies for participants to endorse. Implementation of endorsed safer-drinking strategies was recorded at the next appointment. At both time points, strategies to buffer the effects of alcohol on the body (e.g., eating prior to and during drinking) were most highly endorsed, followed by changing the manner in which one drinks (e.g., spacing drinks), and reducing alcohol consumption. Quantitative analyses indicated that all participants endorsed safer-drinking strategies, and nearly all strategies were implemented (80-90% at weeks 0 and 8, respectively). These preliminary findings indicate that chronically homeless people with alcohol dependence use strategies to reduce harm associated with their drinking. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to test whether interventions that teach safer-drinking strategies may reduce overall alcohol-related harm in this population.

AB  - This paper describes a model of flexible psychiatric outreach service in Canada designed to meet the needs of persons who are homeless or marginally housed and have mental illness. The activities of the Psychiatric Outreach Team of the Royal Ottawa Hospital for individual clients and the community agencies who serve them are profiled, followed by a demographic and mental and physical health profile of the clients seen in the past year. The differences from other models of service and the benefits and limitations of this unique multidisciplinary team are discussed, with implications for future service development for this vulnerable population.

AB  - Purpose No research has examined childbirth from a national perspective among females emancipating from foster care. The present study fills this gap by: (1) documenting the rates of initial and repeat births among females ages 17 and 19 in a national prospective study and (2) identifying risk and protective factors at age 17 that predict childbirth between ages 17 and 19. Methods This study used data from the National Youth in Transition Database and Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System to identify risk and protective factors associated with childbirth in a national sample of transition-age female youth (N = 3,474). Results The cumulative rate of childbirth by age 19 was 21%, with higher rates reported between ages 17 and 19 (17%; n = 602) compared with age 17 or earlier (9%; n = 313). In logistic regression analysis, black race and Hispanic ethnicity, placement with relatives, runaway status, trial home visit placement, early emancipation from foster care, and lifetime incarceration histories were associated with increased likelihood of childbirth. In contrast, school enrollment and employment skills were associated with decreased likelihood of childbirth. The multivariate odds of childbirth between ages 17 and 19 increased 10-fold if youth already had a child by age 17. Conclusions Sexual health and pregnancy prevention programs should specifically target youths who already have children. Increased attention should be paid to adolescents placed with biological families and those with histories of criminal involvement.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Addiction severity has been associated with numerous social- and health-related harms. This study sought to examine the prevalence and correlates of high-intensity drug use among street-involved youth in a Canadian setting with a focus on high-risk drug use practices and health service access. Methods: Data were derived from the At-Risk Youth Study, a Vancouver-based prospective cohort of street-involved youth aged 14–26. We used generalized estimating equations to examine variables associated with high-intensity drug use, defined as daily use of crack cocaine, cocaine, heroin, or crystal methamphetamine. Results: From September 2005 to November 2012, of 1017 youth included in the analyses, 529 (52%) reported high-intensity drug use as defined above at least once during the study period. In a multivariate analysis, older age (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.47); residing in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver (AOR = 1.46); homelessness (AOR = 1.30); recent incarceration (AOR = 1.25); inability to access addiction treatment (AOR = 1.42); and crack pipe sharing and/or used syringe injecting (AOR = 2.64), were all positively and independently associated with high-intensity drug use (p < 0.05). The most common barrier to accessing addiction treatment reported by these youth was long waiting lists. Conclusions: High-intensity drug use among street-involved youth was prevalent and associated with structural and geographical disadvantages in addition to high-risk drug administration practices. Youth reporting more frequent drug use also reported barriers to accessing addiction treatment, highlighting the need to expand addiction services tailored to youth at greatest risk of harm from illicit drug use and street-involvement.

AB  - Background: Economic vulnerability, such as homelessness and unemployment, contributes to the HIV risk among racial minorities in the U.S., who are disproportionately infected. Yet, few economic-strengthening interventions have been adapted for HIV prevention in economically-vulnerable African-American young adults. Engaging Microenterprise for Resource Generation and Health Empowerment (EMERGE) is a feasibility randomized clinical trial of an HIV prevention microenterprise intervention with integrated text messages ("nudges") that are informed by behavioral economic principles. The trial aims to reduce sexual risk behaviors and increase employment and uptake of HIV preventive behaviors.Methods/design: In total, 40 young adults who are African-American, aged 18-24, live in Baltimore City, have experienced at least one episode of homelessness in the last 12 months, are unemployed or underemployed (fewer than 10 h per week), are not enrolled in school, own a cell phone with text messaging, and report at least one episode of unprotected or unsafe sex in the prior 12 months will be recruited from two community-based organizations providing residential supportive services to urban youth. Participants will undergo a 3-week run-in period and thereafter be randomly assigned to one of two groups with active interventions for 20 weeks. The first group ("comparison") will receive text messages with information on job openings. The second group ("experimental") will receive text messages with information on job openings plus information on HIV prevention and business educational sessions, a mentored apprenticeship, and a start-up grant, and business and HIV prevention text messages based on principles from behavioral economics. The two primary outcomes relate to the feasibility of conducting a larger trial. Secondary outcomes relate to employment, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV preventive practices. All participants will be assessed using an in-person questionnaire at pre-intervention (prior to randomization) and at 3 weeks post-intervention. To obtain repeated, longitudinal measures, participants will be assessed weekly using text message surveys from pre-intervention up to 3 weeks post-intervention.Discussion: This study will be one of the first U.S.-based feasibility randomized clinical trials of an HIV prevention microenterprise intervention for economically-vulnerable African-American young adults. The findings will inform whether and how to conduct a larger efficacy trial for HIV risk reduction in this population.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03766165 .

AB  - San Francisco (SF), a city with large HIV-infected and homeless populations, expanded supportive housing for HIV-infected people in 2007. We used the SF HIV/AIDS registry to compare survival between people who were homeless and who were housed at time of HIV diagnosis from 2002 through 2011. Housing status was obtained from medical records and deaths from local, state, and national vital registration. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. Ten percent of the 5,474 cases were homeless. Among people diagnosed between 2002 and 2006, the five-year survival was worse for people who were homeless at HIV diagnosis than for housed individuals (79% vs. 92%, pc.0001), but not for those diagnosed between 2007 and 2011 (92% vs. 93%, p=.3938). The improved survival among HIV-infected homeless people occurred during the time of increased supportive housing for this population. Our findings support including housing as an essential component of HIV care.

AB  - Background: Inequalities in health are a major public-health concern. A greater understanding is needed on the relative importance of different causes. We investigated the contribution of risk factors identified at different life stages to inequalities in self-rated health. Methods: We used data from 5606 men and 5799 women in the 1958 British birth cohort followed-up to age 33 years, on health behaviour, education, adolescent health, family structure and social support, work characteristics, and material circumstances. We assessed the contribution of different factors to social-class differences in self-rated health by adjustment of odds ratios (classes IV and V vs I and II). Findings: Odds ratios of poor-rated health at age 33 were 3.15 for men and 2.30 for women, which decreased to 2.06 and 1.34, respectively, after adjustment for previously identified factors from birth to early adulthood. Adjustment for adult work characteristics, material circumstances, and health behaviour between ages 23 years and 33 years further decreased the odds ratios to 1.64 (men) and 1.11 (women). Most factors contributed to the reduction in odds ratios, although adolescent socioemotional adjustment, class at birth, educational qualifications, and psychosocial job strain were especially important. Additional key factors for men were adult smoking and job insecurity, and for women, housing during childhood, adult income, and age at first child. Interpretation: There was no single cause of health inequality at age 33 years. Explanations spanned from early life to young adulthood. Policy implications include reduction of social differences in material circumstances and of differences in individual skills and resources acquired in early life.

AB  - Poverty is an important patient-reported outcome of therapy and a potential predictor of outcome disparities in pediatric cancer. We previously identified that nearly 30% of pediatric cancer families experience household material hardship (HMH), a concrete measure of poverty including food, energy, or housing insecurity, during the first 6 months of chemotherapy. We conducted a follow-up survey in a subcohort of these families at least 1 year off-therapy and found that 32% reported HMH in early survivorship. Persistently high concrete resource needs off-therapy may have significance for child health and quality of life, and thus represent targets for future investigation.

AB  - Individuals with serious and persistent mental illness are among the disenfranchised populations in the United States today. This group includes many who are homeless, unemployed, or working for minimum wage. They are often underserved or unserved while they encounter a multitude of access barriers to quality health care. A historical review of representative literature reveals that although known for over a quarter of a century, evidence-based practices regarding treatment of comorbid behavioral and primary health needs of individuals with serious mental illness have not become standardized. In this article, the author describes a performance improvement project within a behavioral health network, begun in 2002, which evolved into a controlled field study in 2003 and then into a partially funded program in 2004. The data presented support current literature and make the economic and societal case for an integrated model of behavioral and primary health care for individuals with serious mental illness, which is embedded into the behavioral health care setting.

AB  - Abstract: Purpose: We evaluate the efficacy of a short family intervention in reducing sexual risk behavior, drug use, and delinquent behaviors among homeless youth. Methods: A randomized controlled trial of 151 families with a homeless adolescent aged 12 to 17 years. Between March 2006 and June 2009, adolescents were recruited from diverse sites in Southern California and were assessed at recruitment (baseline), and at 3, 6, and 12 months later. Families were randomly assigned to an intervention condition with five weekly home-based intervention sessions or a control condition (standard care). Main outcome measures reflect self-reported sexual risk behavior, substance use, and delinquent behaviors over the past 90 days. Results: Sexual risk behavior (e.g., mean number of partners; p < .001), alcohol use (p = .003), hard drug use (p < .001), and delinquent behaviors (p = .001) decreased significantly more during 12 months in the intervention condition compared with the control condition. Marijuana use, however, significantly increased in the intervention condition compared with the control condition (p < .001). Conclusions: An intervention to reengage families of homeless youth has significant benefits in reducing risk over 12 months.

AB  - The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) significantly affects minority emerging adults, among whom the rate of new diagnoses is high and health disparities are more pronounced. Importantly, emerging adults today have limited knowledge of the earlier toll of the virus when it was identified as a killer. Among this population, perceptions of risk for HIV are low and sexual risk taking behaviors are high. The Get SMART Project is a behavioral intervention aimed to provide re-purposed HIV, alcohol, and substance abuse prevention education and HIV testing to African American emerging adults ages 18-24. The project was guided by the Health Belief Model, Community Promise, and Training for Institutional Procedures. Findings revealed that HIV testing is low. Marijuana and alcohol are drugs of choice. Emerging adults do not see themselves at risk for HIV, although they engaged in high-risk behaviors. Additionally, survival expectations influence behavior risk.

AB  - Case management has become the predominant model for attempting to improve outcomes for young adults experiencing both homelessness and unemployment. However, there is little evidence-based knowledge about how young adults respond to case management, and how much intervention is needed to be effective. This Australian study utilised quantitative government data to investigate the effects of the amount of case management on key outcomes. With a purposive sample of 224 people aged 18–35, this study compared four different amounts of YP4 case management service received over a three-year period. Participants were categorised into four groupings depending on the number of case management contacts they received: 0–5, 6–20, 21–40, and 41–156. The findings show some significant group variations over the course of the trial in the areas of employment and accommodation. Participants who received 20 or more contacts had significantly better accommodation and employment outcomes than those who received fewer contacts.
AB  - 个案管理已成为改善无家失业青年状况的主要方式。不过，青年人如何看待个案管理，需要多少干预方能凑效，还缺少实在的知识。这项澳大利亚的研究使用了政府的定性资料来考察个案管理对于关键结果的影响。立意抽样样本包括224位年龄在18—35的中青年，作者比较了个案管理在三年期内所得到的四个不同程度的YP4。参与者根据其得到的个案管理接触的多寡分成四组：0—5，6—20，21—40，41—156。研究发现，在就业及居住方面的尝试过程中，存在这明显的群体差异。有过20次以上干预接触的参与者在居住和就业方面比起次数少的要有更好的结果。

AB  - This study examined gender differences among homeless young adults' coping strategies and homelessness stressors as they relate to legal (e.g., full-time employment, selling personal possessions, selling blood/plasma) and illegal economic activity (e.g., selling drugs, theft, prostitution). A sample of 601 homeless young adults was recruited from 3 cities (Los Angeles, CA [ n = 200], Austin, TX [ n = 200], and Denver, CO [ n = 201]) to participate in semi-structured interviews from March 2010 to July 2011. Risk and resilience correlates of legal and illegal economic activity were analyzed using six Ordinary Least Squares regression models with the full sample and with the female and male sub-samples. In the full sample, three variables (i.e., avoidant coping , problem-focused coping , and mania ) were associated with legal income generation whereas eight variables (i.e., social coping, age, arrest history, transience, peer substance use, antisocial personality disorder [ASPD], substance use disorder [SUD], and major depressive episode [MDE] ) were associated with illegal economic activity. In the female sub-sample, three variables (i.e., problem-focused coping , race / ethnicity , and transience ) were correlated with legal income generation whereas six variables (i.e., problem-focused coping , social coping , age , arrest history , peer substance use , and ASPD ) were correlated with illegal economic activity. Among males, the model depicting legal income generation was not significant yet seven variables (i.e., social coping , age , transience , peer substance use , ASPD , SUD , and MDE ) were associated with illegal economic activity. Understanding gender differences in coping strategies and economic activity might help customize interventions aimed at safe and legal income generation for this population.

AB  - Abstract Objective: This work aimed to evaluate gender differences among the street-entrenched youth in British Columbia in terms of their demographics, experiences of childhood maltreatment, mental health issues, and substance use behaviors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were derived from the BC Health of the Homeless Study (BCHOHS), carried out in three cities in British Columbia, Canada. Measures included socio-demographic information, the Maudsley Addiction Profile (MAP), the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) Plus and the National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients (NSHAPC)-Health Chapter. RESULTS: Youth constituted 16.5% (n=82) of the homeless population. Females (55%) outnumbered males and engaged in survival sex more frequently (17.8%; p=0.03). Males had greater substance abuse of alcohol (81.1%) and cannabis (89.2%). Depression (p=0.02) and psychosis (p=0.05) were more common among females, while panic disorder was more common among males (p=0.04). Rates of childhood trauma were similar across genders. CONCLUSION: Our findings reflect trends among youth where illicit drug use may be similar among genders while males may report increased alcohol and cannabis use, possibly as a means to self medicate their panic-related symptoms. In any case, this population of street entrenched-youth frequently experiences several significant problems ranging from childhood abuse to high rates of substance abuse and mental illnesses.

AB  - The current study employs data from the U.S. National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N= 10,818; 56% female; 21% African American) to test how experiencing homelessness through emerging adulthood and child maltreatment predict adult property crime and violent crime. Unlike many published studies on homelessness, we used propensity score matching to correct for selection bias between homeless and nonhomeless individuals. Logistic regression models were run to predict violent and property crime in adulthood, controlling for child maltreatment. Participants who experienced homelessness by age 26 were 1.6 times more likely to commit violent crime in adulthood and almost 30% more likely to commit property crime. Those who were victims of child maltreatment were 15 times more likely to commit property crime, but no more likely to commit violent crime. Findings show that comparing statistically equivalent groups, homelessness through emerging adulthood significantly predicted adult criminality while child maltreatment showed more variable results. Greater prevention efforts aimed at children and adolescents at high risk of experiencing homelessness, as well as more intensive outreach services to homeless youth, may moderate exposure and reduce reliance on criminal survival behaviors.

AB  - This cross-sectional study compares childbirth delivery outcomes and costs of care among women experiencing homelessness vs those not experiencing homelessness. Key Points: Question: Do pregnant women experiencing homelessness have poorer childbirth delivery outcomes and higher costs of care compared with pregnant women not experiencing homelessness? Findings: In this multistate population-based cross-sectional study of 15 029 pregnant women experiencing homelessness and 308 242 pregnant women not experiencing homelessness, those experiencing homelessness were more likely to experience preterm labor and had higher delivery-associated costs. Those experiencing homelessness were also more likely to experience placental abnormalities, although this difference was not statistically significant. Meaning: These findings suggest that, within the same hospital, housing status is associated with preterm labor and higher delivery costs. Importance: Women and families constitute the fastest-growing segments of the homeless population. However, there is limited evidence on whether women experiencing homelessness have poorer childbirth delivery outcomes and higher costs of care compared with women not experiencing homelessness. Objective: To compare childbirth delivery outcomes and costs of care between pregnant women experiencing homelessness vs those not experiencing homelessness. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included 15 029 pregnant women experiencing homelessness and 308 242 pregnant women not experiencing homelessness who had a delivery hospitalization in 2014. The study used statewide databases that included all hospital admissions in 3 states (ie, Florida, Massachusetts, and New York). Delivery outcomes and delivery-associated costs were compared between pregnant women experiencing homelessness and those not experiencing homelessness cared for at the same hospital (analyzed using the overlap propensity-score weighting method and multivariable regression models with hospital fixed effects). The Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate procedure was used to account for multiple comparisons. Data were analyzed from January 2020 through May 2020. Exposure: Housing status at delivery hospitalization. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcome variables included obstetric complications (ie, antepartum hemorrhage, placental abnormalities, premature rupture of the membranes, preterm labor, and postpartum hemorrhage), neonatal complications (ie, fetal distress, fetal growth restriction, and stillbirth), delivery method (ie, cesarean delivery), and delivery-associated costs. Results: Among 15 029 pregnant women experiencing homelessness (mean [SD] age, 28.5 [5.9] years) compared with 308 242 pregnant women not experiencing homelessness (mean [SD] age, 29.4 [5.8] years) within the same hospital, those experiencing homelessness were more likely to experience preterm labor (adjusted probability, 10.5% vs 6.7%; adjusted risk difference [aRD], 3.8%; 95% CI, 1.2%-6.5%; adjusted P =.03) and had higher delivery-associated costs (adjusted costs, $6306 vs $5888; aRD, $417; 95% CI, $156-$680; adjusted P =.02) compared with women not experiencing homelessness. Those experiencing homelessness also had a higher probability of placental abnormalities (adjusted probability, 4.0% vs 2.0%; aRD, 1.9%; 95% CI, 0.4%-3.5%; adjusted P =.053), although this difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that women experiencing homelessness, compared with those not experiencing homelessness, who had a delivery and were admitted to the same hospital were more likely to experience preterm labor and incurred higher delivery-associated costs. These findings suggest wide disparities in delivery-associated outcomes between women experiencing homelessness and those not experiencing homelessness in the US. The findings highlight the importance for health care professionals to actively screen pregnant women for homelessness during prenatal care visits and coordinate their care with community health programs and social housing programs to make sure their health care needs are met.

AB  - Hurricane Sandy struck New York City on October 29, 2012, causing not only a large amount of physical damage, but also straining people's health and disrupting health care services throughout the city. In prior research, we determined that emergency department (ED) visits from the most vulnerable hurricane evacuation flood zones in New York City increased after Hurricane Sandy for several medical diagnoses, but also for the diagnosis of homelessness. In the current study, we aimed to further explore this increase in ED visits for homelessness after Hurricane Sandy's landfall. We performed an observational before-and-after study using an all-payer claims database of ED visits in New York City to compare the demographic characteristics, insurance status, geographic distribution, and health conditions of ED patients with a primary or secondary ICD-9 diagnosis of homelessness or inadequate housing in the first week after Hurricane Sandy's landfall versus the baseline weekly average in 2012 prior to Hurricane Sandy. We found statistically significant increases in ED visits for diagnosis codes of homelessness or inadequate housing in the week after Hurricane Sandy's landfall. Those accessing the ED for homelessness or inadequate housing were more often elderly and insured by Medicare after versus before the hurricane. Secondary diagnoses among those with a primary ED diagnosis of homelessness or inadequate housing also differed after versus before Hurricane Sandy. These observed differences in the demographic, insurance, and co-existing diagnosis profiles of those with an ED diagnosis of homelessness or inadequate housing before and after Hurricane Sandy suggest that a new population cohort-potentially including those who had lost their homes as a result of storm damage-was accessing the ED for homelessness or other housing issues after the hurricane. Emergency departments may serve important public health and disaster response roles after a hurricane, particularly for people who are homeless or lack adequate housing. Further, tracking ED visits for homelessness may represent a novel surveillance mechanism to assess post-disaster infrastructure impact and to prepare for future disasters.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe and explain variations in first mental health service utilization before and after running away from home for homeless adolescents. METHODS: Survey interviews were conducted with homeless and runaway youth in several Midwestern locations. The effects of family of origin factors and street experiences on the likelihood of seeing a mental health professional for the first time before running away and after running away for the first time were examined. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression methods are used to analyze these data. Interactions are tested across race and gender sub-groups. RESULTS: Caretaker education, caretaker rejection, and family transitions increase the probability that an adolescent first sees a mental health professional before running away from home. Post-run intervention is more likely for females, younger runaways, shelter users, youths with social support networks, and youths abused by their caretakers. A gender gap in first service use exists for Whites but not for minority youth. Minority youth who experienced family abuse were less likely than abused Whites to report ever seeing a mental health professional. CONCLUSIONS: Analyses indicate homeless youth's utilization patterns are differentiated by family of origin factors, street experiences, timing of first utilization, and by race and gender interactions. Our findings suggest that youths whose first contact with mental health service use follows running away for the first time may experience higher levels of mental distress compared with other homeless runaways. The significant differences in first service use across race and gender subgroups should be further explored. The racial-ethnic gap in first mental health intervention for abused youths indicates this sub-group is not receiving services that are available to other homeless youths. Our findings suggest that homelessness does not homogenize racial/ethnic differences in first mental health service utilization.

AB  - • Birth control use among female youth who are homeless triples following Wahine Talk. • LARC and Depo-Provera were the most popular birth control methods selected. • Wahine Talk is a feasible and acceptable multilevel, trauma-informed SRH program. Female youth experiencing homelessness are at high risk for pregnancy due to a host of individual, family, and community-level risk factors. This embedded mixed-method quasi-experimental pilot study examined the initial outcomes of Wahine (woman) Talk, a comprehensive sexual health program delivered by an interdisciplinary team to female youth experiencing homelessness. Wahine Talk includes provision of and connection to basic needs resources, peer mentoring, group based sexual health education, and linkage to and provision of sexual health care. Process and outcome data were collected throughout and for six months after Wahine Talk from a diverse group of 14–22-year-old female youth (N = 51) experiencing homelessness. In-depth individual and focus group interview data were collected from providers and youth after Wahine Talk, and analyzed using Template Analysis. Over half (62.7%) of participants were linked to sexual health care during Wahine Talk and birth control usage tripled following the program. Depo-Provera and long acting reversible contraception (LARC) usage, in particular, increased during Wahine Talk (1–19% and 0–25.5%, respectively). Within six months, 31.4% of youth had adopted LARC and 3.9% were using Depo-Provera. Individual and focus group interviews with providers and youth affirm program acceptability and appropriateness.

AB  - A culturally diverse sample of formerly homeless youth (ages 6-12) and their families (n = 223) participated in a cluster randomized controlled trial of the Early Risers conduct problems prevention program in a supportive housing setting. Parents provided 4 annual behaviorally-based ratings of executive functioning (EF) and conduct problems, including at baseline, over 2 years of intervention programming, and at a 1-year follow-up assessment. Using intent-to-treat analyses, a multilevel latent growth model revealed that the intervention group demonstrated reduced growth in conduct problems over the 4 assessment points. In order to examine mediation, a multilevel parallel process latent growth model was used to simultaneously model growth in EF and growth in conduct problems along with intervention status as a covariate. A significant mediational process emerged, with participation in the intervention promoting growth in EF, which predicted negative growth in conduct problems. The model was consistent with changes in EF fully mediating intervention-related changes in youth conduct problems over the course of the study. These findings highlight the critical role that EF plays in behavioral change and lends further support to its importance as a target in preventive interventions with populations at risk for conduct problems.

AB  - Younger onset dementia (YOD) not only affects the person with the diagnosis but the whole family, which often includes young people. A limited body of research on this group of young people indicates that they experience varying degrees of emotional trauma. We explored the lived experiences of young people having a parent with YOD from the perspective of the social model of disability. Data were available from semi-structured interviews with 12 young people who had a parent with YOD looking at their lived experiences between 8 and 24 years. Thematic analysis identified four main themes: the emotional toll of caring, keeping the family together, grief and loss and psychological distress. The social model of disability theory provides a helpful framework for these families who experience significant emotional distress, demonstrating that the disability is often socially constructed by a society, which marginalizes and excludes them. A ‘whole family’ approach is proposed, where the needs of young people and their parents are respected and responded to age appropriately.

AB  - Background: High rates of food insecurity are documented among Inuit households in Canada; however, data on food insecurity prevalence and seasonality for Inuit households with children are lacking, especially in city centres. This project: (1) compared food consumption patterns for households with and without children, (2) compared the prevalence of food insecurity for households with and without children, (3) compared food consumption patterns and food insecurity prevalence between seasons, and (4) identified factors associated with food insecurity in households with children in Iqaluit, Nunavut, Canada.Methods: Randomly selected households were surveyed in Iqaluit in September 2012 and May 2013. Household food security status was determined using an adapted United States Department of Agriculture Household Food Security Survey Module. Univariable logistic regressions were used to examine unconditional associations between food security status and demographics, socioeconomics, frequency of food consumption, and method of food preparation in households with children by season.Results: Households with children (n = 431) and without children (n = 468) participated in the survey. Food insecurity was identified in 32.9% (95% CI: 28.5-37.4%) of households with children; this was significantly higher than in households without children (23.2%, 95% CI: 19.4-27.1%). The prevalence of household food insecurity did not significantly differ by season. Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the person responsible for food preparation, including low formal education attainment (ORSept = 4.3, 95% CI: 2.3-8.0; ORMay = 3.2, 95% CI: 1.8-5.8), unemployment (ORSept = 1.1, 95% CI: 1.1-1.3; ORMay = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.5), and Inuit identity (ORSept = 8.9, 95% CI: 3.4-23.5; ORMay = 21.8, 95% CI: 6.6-72.4), were associated with increased odds of food insecurity in households with children. Fruit and vegetable consumption (ORSept = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.8; ORMay = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.2-0.9), as well as eating cooked (ORSept = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-1.0; ORMay = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.9) and raw (ORSept = 1.7, 95% CI: 0.9-3.0; ORMay = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.0-3.1) fish were associated with decreased odds of food insecurity among households with children, while eating frozen meat and/or fish (ORSept = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.4-5.0; ORMay = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.1-3.7) was associated with increased odds of food insecurity.Conclusions: Food insecurity is high among households with children in Iqaluit. Despite the partial subsistence livelihoods of many Inuit in the city, we found no seasonal differences in food security and food consumption for households with children. Interventions aiming to decrease food insecurity in these households should consider food consumption habits, and the reported demographic and socioeconomic determinants of food insecurity.

AB  - Background Food insecurity is hypothesized to influence mothers’ use of parenting strategies to regulate children’s eating. Little is known about the parenting practices directed toward adolescents in food-insecure households. Objective Our aim was to examine the differences in use of eating- and weight-related parenting practices among mothers of adolescents by household food-security status. Design This was a cross-sectional study. Participants/setting A sociodemographically diverse sample of mothers and adolescents from the Minneapolis/St Paul, MN, metropolitan area who participated in the Eating and Activity Among Teens 2010 and Project Families and Eating and Activity Among Teens studies in 2009 to 2010 (dyad n=2,087). Seventy percent of mothers identified as nonwhite. Main outcome measures We examined mother-reported use of parenting practices, including pressuring children to eat, restricting high-calorie foods, and encouraging dieting. Statistical analyses performed Logistic regression models were used to determine the predicted probabilities of parenting practices among food-secure, low food-secure, and very-low food-secure households. Sociodemographic characteristics, mothers’ body mass index, and adolescents’ body mass index-for-age percentile were examined as confounders. Results In unadjusted models, food-insecure mothers were more likely than food-secure mothers to frequently encourage their children to diet, comment on their child’s weight, be concerned about their child’s weight, use restrictive feeding practices, and use pressured feeding practices. After adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics and mothers’ and children’s body mass index, compared to food-secure mothers, mothers with low food security were more likely to frequently comment on their sons’ weight (41.5% vs 32.9%, prevalence difference=8.6; 95% CI 0.9 to 16.3) and mothers with very low food security were more likely to be concerned about their sons’ weight (48.8% vs 35.1%; prevalence difference=13.7; 95% CI 3.5 to 23.9). Mothers with very low food security were more likely to frequently use restrictive feeding practices with their daughters compared to food-secure mothers (33.0% vs 20.5%; prevalence difference=12.4; 95% CI 4.2 to 20.7). Conclusions Interventions to improve food-insecure adolescents’ eating behaviors may benefit from supporting mothers’ use of health-promoting parenting practices.

AB  - Housing instability is associated with costly patterns of health and behavioral health service use. However, little prior research has examined patterns of service use associated with higher costs among those experiencing ongoing housing instability. To address this gap, we compared inpatient and outpatient medical and behavioral health service utilization and costs between veterans experiencing brief and ongoing episodes of housing instability. We used data from a brief screening instrument for homelessness and housing instability that has been implemented throughout the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system to identify a national sample of veterans experiencing housing instability. Veterans were classified as experiencing either brief or ongoing housing instability, based on two consecutive responses to the instrument, and we used a series of two-part regression models to conduct adjusted comparisons of costs between veterans experiencing brief and ongoing episodes of housing instability. Among 5794 veterans screening positive for housing instability, 4934 (85%) were experiencing brief and 860 (15%) ongoing instability. The average total annual incremental cost associated with ongoing versus brief episodes of housing instability was estimated at $7573, with the bulk of this difference found in inpatient services. Cost differences resulted more from a higher probability of service use among those experiencing ongoing episodes of housing instability than from higher costs among service users. Our findings suggest that VA programmatic efforts aimed at preventing extended episodes of housing instability could potentially result in substantial cost offsets for the VA health care system.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Student-Run Free Clinics (SRFCs) play a significant role in medical education yet there is minimal information about patient outcomes over time in this setting. The purpose of this study was to assess longitudinal outcomes of hypertension management during routine care at four SRFC sites, while comparing control rates with national standards, and examining for characteristics independently associated with uncontrolled hypertension.Methods: The authors conducted a retrospective medical record review of visits from January 2004 through April 2016 with an initial visit for hypertension and a follow-up visit 9 to 15 months later. Hypertension control was analyzed using descriptive statistics, paired t tests, logistic regression, and a longitudinal linear mixed-effects model.Results: This study included 496 patients and 4,798 visits. The mean age was 50.9 (SD 10.8) years old, 71.2% (346) were Latinos, 63.3% (314) were Spanish speaking, and 15.5% (72) were homeless. Mean blood pressure was reduced from 141.6 (SD 21.8)/85.1 (SD 13.2) to 132.1 (SD 17.3)/79.4 (SD10.8), a decrease of 9.5 (CI 7.4, 11.5)/5.7 (CI 4.4, 7.0) mmHg. Blood pressure was significantly reduced within the first month of treatment, and this reduction was sustained throughout the follow-up period. Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) definition (<140/<90), blood pressure was controlled in 59.7% (296/496) of patients. No significant differences in control were noted based on gender, ethnicity, language, housing status, or clinic site.Conclusions: SRFCs can provide effective long-term hypertension management and achieve rates of control that exceed national averages despite serving those least likely to be controlled.

AB  - Sex workers report high rates of unintended pregnancy that are inconsistent with widespread reports of condom use. Greater understanding of the implications of an unintended pregnancy and barriers to contraceptive use is needed to better meet the broader sexual and reproductive health needs of this population. We conducted in-depth interviews with 20 women sex workers in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Findings reveal that most women are trying to conform to societal norms and protect their reputations. They fear pregnancy would reveal that they are having unsanctioned sex and that they are sex workers. This could lead to ostracism from families and society, resulting in homelessness and abandonment by partners. Pregnancy may affect a sex worker's ability to work and leave her unable to meet financial obligations. All study participants were using condoms but most acknowledged they could not use them consistently. They had all tried other contraceptive methods, notably injectables and the pill, but some noted experience of side-effects, difficulties in adherence and the desire to use other methods. Understanding the context of sex workers' lives is an important step in informing stakeholders about the range of services needed to improve their sexual and reproductive health.
AB  - Las trabajadoras sexuales reportan elevadas tasas de embarazos no deseados que son incompatibles con los informes generalizados en torno al uso de condones. Con el objetivo de dar mejor respuesta a las demandas de salud sexual y reproductiva de esta población, es necesario comprender más a detalle las implicaciones que conlleva el embarazo no deseado, así como las barreras existentes respecto al uso de anticonceptivos. Las autoras del presente artículo realizaron entrevistas a profundidad con veinte sexoservidoras de Dhaka, Bangladesh. Los resultados obtenidos dan cuenta de que la mayoría de las mujeres entrevistadas intenta adaptarse a las normas sociales y proteger su reputación. En este sentido, temen que un embarazo ponga al descubierto que participan en actividades sexuales no aprobadas y que ejercen el trabajo sexual. Esto podría provocar el ostracismo por parte de su familia y la sociedad, además de la indigencia y el abandono de sus parejas. El embarazo puede restringir la capacidad de trabajar de la sexoservidora, llevándola al incumplimiento de sus obligaciones financieras. Todas las sexoservidoras participantes en este estudio señalaron que utilizan condones, aunque reconocieron que no siempre los pueden usar. Asimismo, todas han empleado otros métodos anticonceptivos, entre ellos, los inyectados y las píldoras; sin embargo, algunas reportaron efectos secundarios, dificultades en el cumplimiento y el deseo de utilizar otros métodos. Por ello, la comprensión del contexto de vida de la sexoservidora constituye un paso importante en el sentido de que sea posible brindar información a esta población respecto a la gama de servicios que pueden utilizar para mejorar su salud sexual y reproductiva.
AB  - Les travailleuses du sexe rapportent des taux élevés de grossesses non désirées qui sont en contradiction avec les nombreux rapports sur l'usage du préservatif. Il est nécessaire d'approfondir la compréhension des conséquences d'une grossesse non désirée et des obstacles à l'usage des méthodes contraceptives afin de mieux répondre aux besoins de santé sexuelle et reproductive dans cette population. Nous avons conduit des entretiens en profondeur avec 20 travailleuses du sexe à Dhaka, au Bangladesh. Les résultats révèlent que la plupart de ces femmes tentent de respecter les normes sociétales et de protéger leur réputation. Elles craignent d'une grossesse qu'elle révèle leurs activités sexuelles non autorisées et leur statut de travailleuses du sexe. Ces révélations pourraient conduire à de l'ostracisme de la part de leur famille et de la société, à la perte de leur logement et à leur abandon par leur partenaire. La grossesse peut avoir pour conséquence d'entraver l'exercice de leur activité et, de ce fait, de les empêcher de faire face à leurs engagements financiers. Si toutes les participantes à l'étude ont déclaré qu'elles utilisaient des préservatifs, la plupart d'entre elles ont reconnu qu'elles étaient incapables de le faire régulièrement. Elles avaient toutes expérimenté d'autres méthodes contraceptives, en particulier les formes injectables et les pilules, mais certaines ont évoqué des effets secondaires, des difficultés d'observance et le désir d'avoir recours à d'autres choix contraceptifs. La compréhension du contexte de vie des travailleuses du sexe est une étape importante de la communication d'informations aux parties prenantes, sur la gamme de services qu'il est nécessaire de mettre en place pour améliorer la santé sexuelle et reproductive de ces femmes.

AB  - Background: Universal access to the School Breakfast Program (SBP) is intended to help low-income and food-insecure students overcome barriers to eating breakfast. However, SBP participation is often still low despite universal access. Further information is needed with regard to these children's breakfast behaviors, and in particular breakfast behaviors among youth from food-insecure families, to inform effective breakfast interventions.Objectives: The objective of this study was to examine breakfast behaviors among a large sample of urban students with universal access to the SBP and to identify differences in breakfast behaviors among children from food-secure compared with food-insecure households.Methods: A cross-sectional study of 821 fourth- through sixth-grade students and their parents from 16 schools was conducted. Students reported the foods/drinks selected and location of obtaining food/drink on the morning of data collection, parents reported household food security status using the 6-item Food Security Survey Module, and the school district provided SBP participation data during the fall semester of 2013. Multivariable linear regression models accounting for school-level clustering were used to examine differences in breakfast behaviors across 3 levels of household food security: food secure, low food secure, and very low food secure.Results: Students participated in the SBP 31.2% of possible days, with 13% never participating in the SBP. One-fifth (19.4%) of students purchased something from a corner store for breakfast, and 16.9% skipped breakfast. Forty-six percent of students were food insecure; few differences in breakfast behaviors were observed across levels of food security.Conclusions: Despite universal access to the SBP, participation in the SBP is low. Breakfast skipping and selection of foods of low nutritional quality in the morning are common, regardless of household food security status. Additional novel implementation of the SBP and addressing students' breakfast preferences may be necessary to further reduce barriers to students obtaining a free, healthful breakfast. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01924130.

AB  - Purpose: Civilians living amid conflict are at high-risk of burns. However, the epidemiology of burns among this vulnerable group is poorly understood, yet vital for health policy and relief planning. To address this gap, we aimed to determine the death and disability, healthcare needs and household financial consequences of burns in post-invasion Baghdad.Methods: A two-stage, cluster randomized, community-based household survey was performed in May 2014 to determine the civilian burden of injury from 2003 to 2014 in Baghdad. In addition to questions about cause of household member death, households were interviewed regarding burn specifics, healthcare required, disability, relationship to conflict and resultant financial hardship.Results: Nine-hundred households, totaling 5148 individuals, were interviewed. There were 55 burns, which were 10% of all injuries reported. There were an estimated 2340 serious burns (39 per 100,000 persons) in Baghdad in 2003. The frequency of serious burns generally increased post-invasion to 8780 burns in 2013 (117 per 100,000 persons). Eight burns (15%) were the direct result of conflict. Individuals aged over 45 years had more than twice the odds of burn than children aged less than 13 years (aOR 2.42; 95%CI 1.08-5.44). Nineteen burns (35%) involved ≥ 20% body surface area. Death (16% of burns), disability (40%), household financial hardship (48%) and food insecurity (50%) were common after burn.Conclusion: Civilian burn in Baghdad is epidemic, increasing in frequency and associated with household financial hardship. Challenges of healthcare provision during prolonged conflict were evidenced by a high mortality rate and likelihood of disability after burn. Ongoing conflict will directly and indirectly generates more burns, which mandates planning for burn prevention and care within local capacity development initiatives, as well as humanitarian assistance.

AB  - Objectives: Transitional care clinics (TCCs) represent one strategy to facilitate follow-up and primary care linkage for patients with no regular source of care who are discharged from the emergency department (ED). We assessed factors associated with completion of TCC follow-up among these patients and characterized their subsequent ED use.Methods: Retrospective study of 660 randomly sampled patients with a scheduled appointment to a TCC at time of ED discharge. Patient- and visit-level characteristics were abstracted from the medical records of these patients and linked to a state visit database to characterize ED use after referral. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with completion of follow-up and subsequent ED utilization.Results: Half (50%) of the patients completed their follow-up appointment with a mean follow-up time of 6.9days. Non-English language (odds ratio [OR], 2.21; confidence interval [CI], 1.30-3.75) was the only factor associated with improved follow-up; however, patients who were homeless (OR, 0.42; CI, 0.26-0.66) had a substance use history (OR, 0.68; CI, 0.45-1.00), and those with more baseline ED visits (OR, 0.94 per additional ED visit; CI, 0.89-0.99) were significantly less likely to complete follow-up. After adjusting for demographic, clinical, and visit-level characteristics, patients who completed their appointment had significantly fewer ED visits in the subsequent year compared to patients who did not complete their appointment (mean, 2.3 vs 3.3 visits; difference, -1.0 visits in subsequent calendar year; CI for difference, -1.2 to -0.7).Conclusion: Transitional care clinics represent a promising strategy to improve the continuity of care for emergency patients and may reduce unnecessary ED use.

AB  - Despite being a high-risk population, epidemiological research about injuries among homeless individuals is limited. We sought to describe injury characteristics among individuals identified as homeless in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), and to compare them to age- and sex-matched controls. We searched text narratives for all patients with product-related injuries who presented to NEISS emergency departments from 2007 to 2011 to identify homeless cases (N = 268). A random sample of 2680 age- and sex-matched controls was identified for the same time period. The incident location differed between groups, and the mention of substance use was significantly more common among homeless cases than controls. The body part injured differed significantly between cases and controls for all age groups, with the exception of older adults. Among homeless cases, injuries occurred most frequently to the lower extremities, and sprains/strains, contusions/abrasions and burns were most common. Additional research on injury among homeless individuals is warranted in order to identify meaningful preventive strategies for this at-risk population.

AB  - Objective: Few studies have assessed the outcomes of runaway/homeless youth that seek assistance from shelter or crisis services, which would provide much needed documentation of intervention effectiveness and point to new directions for service provision. The goals of the current study were to: (1) assess short-term outcomes among runaway/homeless youth using emergency shelters and crisis services and (2) compare short-term outcomes achieved by runaway/ homeless youth in crisis shelters with similar youth using other, longer-term treatment modalities. Method: The study sampled 261 youth using runaway/homeless shelters from four midwestern states at intake and six-weeks post discharge and 47 high-risk youth using longer-term services at intake and six weeks post intake; ten key outcome variables were assessed. Results: Every outcome variable demonstrated improvement post intervention: days on the run, school suspension and/or detention, and sexual activity decreased; perceived family support and selfesteem increased; and youth were more likely to be currently employed and less likely to have been fired. In comparing runaway/homeless crisis shelter users with day treatment users on the ten outcome variables, there were no significant differences across any of the outcome variables. Conclusions: Despite limitations, the research provides evidence for the short-term effectiveness of crisis shelter services for runaway/homeless youth.

AB  - Eviction represents an urgent social and economic issue in the United States, with nearly two million evictions occurring annually in the U.S. Still, the population health impacts of evictions, as well as the pathways linking eviction to health, are not well documented or understood, particularly among young adults. Using nationally-representative, longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (1994–2008) (n = 9029), the present study uses a combination of analytic methods—including prospective lagged dependent variable regression models, inverse probabilities of treatment weighting, longitudinal first difference models, causal mediation techniques—to comprehensively assess whether and how evictions relate to depressive risk and self-rated health across early adulthood, paying particular attention to the stress-related pathways linking eviction and health. Results provide robust evidence of positive longitudinal associations between eviction and depressive risk, in particular. In the prospective regression models, young adults who experienced recent eviction had more depressive symptoms and worse self-rated health than those who were not evicted, net a host of background characteristics. Using treatment weighting techniques, results showed that young adults who experienced eviction had more depressive symptoms than those who were not evicted (5.921 vs. 4.998 depressive symptoms, p = 0.003). Perceived social stress mediated nearly 18 percent of the associations between eviction and the depressive symptoms (p < 0.001). In the first difference models, young people who experienced eviction between survey waves experienced greater increases in depressive symptoms over time compared to those who were not evicted, net of changes in other indicators of socioeconomic status and residential instability. Taken together, our results suggest that the recent surges in evictions in the U.S. serve as a potent threat to population health during the emerging adult period, with especially devastating consequences for low-income individuals and communities of color. • Eviction represents a major public health issue • Eviction is associated with increased depressive risk over time in young adults • Eviction represents a unique stressor even when confounding factors are considered • Stress mediates the association between eviction and depressive symptoms

AB  - Teenagers' running from foster placement is a significant problem in the field of child protection. This article describes a functional, behavior analytic approach to reducing running away through assessing the motivations for running, involving the youth in the assessment process, and implementing interventions to enhance the reinforcing value of placements for adolescents, thereby reducing the probability of running and associated unsafe periods. A case study illustrates this approach and a study compares 13 adolescents who ran away frequently and received interventions with a group of matched adolescents who had similar patterns of running but received only services as usual. The percentage of days on runaway status showed a significant pre-post reduction for those in the functional group, in contrast to no statistical change in the comparison group. Potential benefits this approach may have for foster care and child protection in improving youth safety, permanence, and connections for life are discussed.

AB  - • Few contemporary cross-national studies have examined young adult homelessness. • We found a similar profile of co-occurring problems in Victoria and Washington State. • Unemployment, antisocial behavior and victimization co-occurred with homelessness. • Young adults with higher weekly income were less likely to report homelessness. • Understanding longitudinal and modifiable predictors of homelessness are warranted. Homelessness is associated with various co-occurring health and social problems yet; few contemporary international studies have examined these problems in young adulthood. This descriptive study presents cross-state comparison of the prevalence of young adult homelessness in Washington State, USA and Victoria, Australia using state representative samples from the International Youth Development Study (IYDS; n = 1945, 53% female). Associations between young adult homelessness and a range of co-occurring problems were examined using a modified version of the Communities That Care youth survey. Results showed significantly higher rates of past year homelessness were reported by young adults in Washington State (5.24% vs. 3.25% in Victoria). Cross-state differences were evident in levels of friends' drug use, antisocial behavior, weekly income and support from peers. Unemployment (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 2.67), antisocial behavior (AOR = 3.54) and victimization (AOR = 3.37) were more likely among young adults reporting homelessness in both states. Young adults with higher weekly income were less likely to report homelessness (AOR = 0.69) in both states. No significant association between mental health problem symptoms, substance use, family conflict or interaction with antisocial peers and homelessness were found in either state. Rates of violent behavior were more strongly related to young adult homelessness in Washington State than Victoria. The current findings suggest that programs that enable young adults to pursue income and employment, reduce antisocial behavior and include services for those who have been victimized, may help to mitigate harm among young adults experiencing homelessness.

AB  - Introduction: Identifying distinct patterns of tobacco product use can inform efforts to reduce poly-tobacco use among young people, but little is known regarding patterns of use among youth experiencing homelessness. This study identified patterns of using tobacco/nicotine products among youth experiencing homelessness, and assessed whether certain subgroups of youth were more likely than others to engage in specific patterns of use.Methods: Data were collected from a probability sample of 469 homeless youth who used tobacco in the past month, recruited from 25 service and street sites in Los Angeles County. Participants reported on lifetime and past month use of natural cigarettes, cigars, little cigars/cigarillos, electronic nicotine delivery systems, hookah, and chewing tobacco. Latent class analysis was used to identify patterns of tobacco product use.Results: We identified four main classes of use: traditional cigarettes smokers (34.7% of the sample), poly-tobacco experimenters (24.9%), current users of combustible products (natural cigarettes, cigars, little cigars/cigarillos; 27.1%), and current poly-tobacco users (13.1%). Youth who were male, slept outdoors, and screened positive for substance abuse disorder were more than twice as likely as their counterparts to be current poly-tobacco users relative to traditional cigarettes smokers.Conclusions: Rates of poly-tobacco experimentation and current use among youth experiencing homelessness are high. This suggests that efforts to reduce the use of tobacco products in this population should focus on the combined use of these products, and further, that users with the greatest poly-use may have competing unmet needs such as substance use disorders and more severe homelessness.

AB  - During 1993-2003, incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in the United States decreased 44% and is now occurring at a historic low level (14,874 cases in 2003). The Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis has called for a renewed commitment to eliminating TB in the United States, and the Institute of Medicine has published a detailed plan for achieving that goal. In this statement, the American Thoracic Society (ATS), CDC, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) propose recommendations to improve the control and prevention of TB in the United States and to progress toward its elimination. This statement is one in a series issued periodically by the sponsoring organizations to guide the diagnosis, treatment, control, and prevention of TB. This statement supersedes the previous statement by ATS and CDC, which was also supported by IDSA and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). This statement was drafted, after an evidence-based review of the subject, by a panel of representatives of the three sponsoring organizations. AAP, the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association, and the Canadian Thoracic Society were also represented on the panel. This statement integrates recent scientific advances with current epidemiologic data, other recent guidelines from this series, and other sources into a coherent and practical approach to the control of TB in the United States. Although drafted to apply to TB control activities in the United States, this statement might be of use in other countries in which persons with TB generally have access to medical and public health services and resources necessary to make a precise diagnosis of the disease; achieve curative medical treatment; and otherwise provide substantial science-based protection of the population against TB. This statement is aimed at all persons who advocate, plan, and work at controlling and preventing TB in the United States, including persons who formulate public health policy and make decisions about allocation of resources for disease control and health maintenance and directors and staff members of state, county, and local public health agencies throughout the United States charged with control of TB. The audience also includes the full range of medical practitioners, organizations, and institutions involved in the health care of persons in the United States who are at risk for TB.

AB  - Cell phone use has become nearly ubiquitous among adolescents in the United States. Despite the potential for cell phones to facilitate intervention, research, and care for homeless youth, no data exists to date on cell phone use among this population. In 2009, a survey of cell phone use was conducted among a non-probability sample of 169 homeless youth in Los Angeles, CA. Levels of ownership and use, instrumental uses (connecting to case workers, employers) and patterns of connecting to various network types were assessed (family, home-based peers, street-based peers). Differences in socio-demographic characteristics and cell phone ownership were assessed via t test and chi-square statistics. Sixty-two percent of homeless youth own a cell phone; 40% have a working phone. Seventeen percent used their phone to call a case manager, 36% to call either a potential or current employer. Fifty-one percent of youth connected with home-based peers on the phone and 41% connected to parents. Cell phones present new opportunities for intervention research, connecting homeless youth to family and home-based peers who can be sources of social support in times of need. Moreover, cell phones provide researchers and providers with new avenues to maintain connections with these highly transient youth.

AB  - Research to date has given little attention to differences in the experience of youth homelessness by ethnicity. This article provides a comparative descriptive analysis of the effect of differences and similarities in paths to homelessness, self-perception, and survival strategies on health behaviors and consequent health outcomes of African American and white homeless youth in San Francisco, USA. We conducted participant observation and ethnographic interviews with 54 youth primarily recruited from street venues. Hypotheses generated from the ethnographic data were validated in between-group analyses using concurrent epidemiological data collected from a sample of 205 youth. Our samples of unstably housed African American and white youth, though sharing common histories of family dysfunction, differed in both the ethnographic accounts and epidemiological analyses in their experiences of family, access to housing, street survival strategies, self-presentation, health behaviors and service utilization. Our sample of white youth generally identified with the term 'homeless,' engaged in survival activities associated with such a label, and accessed the services intended to address the needs of homeless youth. In contrast, our sample of African American youth generally did not perceive themselves as 'homeless,' a stigmatized term, and were thus less likely to utilize, or be accessed by, relevant services.

AB  - Context: Food insecurity is a preventable health threat and may precipitate central obesity and metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents in the United States.Objective: To examine (1) health by household food security status; and (2) differences and prevalence of central obesity among persons aged 12 to 18 years in the United States.Methods: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was administered to a cross-sectional sample of persons aged 12 to 18 years in 1999 to 2006. Controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and sex differences in mean obesity and chronic disease factors across levels of food insecurity (analysis of covariance [Bonferroni post hoc] and ORs [logistic regression analyses]) were examined, as were differences in the rates of risk factors (χ(2) statistics).Results: A total of 7435 participants were analyzed. Those from marginally food secure (n=751) and low-food secure (n=1206) (population size estimate, 26,714,182) households were significantly more likely than their high-food secure counterparts (n=4831) to be overweight (P=.036) (OR, 1.44), and those from marginally food secure households were 1.3-times more likely to be obese (P=.036). Nearly 25% of respondents from marginally food secure, low-food secure, and very low-food secure (n=647) households reported central obesity (P=.002), which was 1.4 to 1.5 times more likely than those from high-food secure households. Participants from high-food secure households had significantly higher mean high-density lipoprotein values (P=.019). Risk factors indicative of metabolic syndrome were present in 3.1%.Conclusion: Household food insecurity was associated with an increased likelihood of being overweight and having central obesity. Limitations included the use of cross-sectional data and some self-reported data and the inability to control for all moderating variables in obesity and overall health status.

AB  - • Asset building is a growing field of anti-poverty advocacy and practice. • Youth in foster care face unique adversity and barriers to building assets. • Little research exists on effectiveness of asset building services for foster youth. • Findings indicate that less than 30% of foster youth receive asset building services. • Compared to similar youth, foster youth receiving services have improved outcomes. Foster youth in the U.S. often face a multitude of adverse outcomes, including low educational attainment, elevated rates of adult poverty, and disproportionately high levels of adult homelessness. One newer area of social policy research and advocacy, asset building, may help explain some of these disparities. Foster youth face several barriers to asset building. For example, many youth have several placements during their stay in care, resulting in youth receiving inconsistent schooling, mentoring, and support, and facing limited opportunities to work, save money, or build academic and professional networks. This paper examines the frequency with which transition-age foster youth receive asset building services and whether the youth who receive services experience improved outcomes compared to those who do not. Analyzing data from the National Youth in Transition Database and using a Propensity Score Matching methodology, this study finds that youth receiving Budgeting and Financial Education Services and Post-Secondary Education Services experience significantly improved outcomes, including reduced likelihood of homelessness and increased likelihood of employment and educational enrollment. However, only 29% of youth receive Budgeting and Financial Education Services, and only 19% of youth receive Post-Secondary Education Services. Service receipt also covaries with demographics, including race/ethnicity and education level. These findings have noteworthy implications for both policy and practice as asset building for foster youth is a potentially promising realm for public service expansion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB) is a 2006 Canadian federal policy of income supplementation that provides parents with $100 monthly in Canadian dollars for each child aged <6years. The study main objective was to estimate the causal effect of UCCB on self-reported food insecurity overall and in vulnerable subgroups. METHOD: The Canadian Community Health Survey (2001-2009) was used to conduct a difference-in-differences (DID) regression analysis for the effect of the UCCB on self-reported food insecurity. Respondents were ages >=12 in families with at least one child aged <6years (UCCB-eligible, n=22,737) or a child aged 6-11 but no child <6years (control group, n=17,664). RESULTS: Over the study period 16.3% of respondents experienced some level of food insecurity. Overall, UCCB reduced the proportion of respondents reporting food insecurity by 2.4% (95% CI: -4.0%, -0.9%). There was a significantly stronger impact on food insecurity for respondents from households with yearly income below the population median (-4.3%, 95% CI: -7.2%, -1.4%) and respondents from single parent families (-5.4%, 95% CI: -10.3%, -0.6%). CONCLUSION: We found that a relatively small monthly income supplementation results in a significant reduction in food insecurity at the population level, with larger effects in vulnerable groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few interventions have focused on improving end-of-life care for underserved populations, such as homeless persons. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether homeless persons will complete a counseling session on advance care planning and fill out a legal advance directive designed to assess care preferences and preserve the dignity of marginalized persons. DESIGN: Prospective, single-blind, randomized trial comparing self-guided completion of an advance directive with professionally assisted advance care planning. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00546884) SETTING: 8 sites serving homeless persons in Minneapolis, Minnesota. PARTICIPANTS: 262 homeless persons recruited between November 2007 and August 2008. INTERVENTION: Minimal, self-guided intervention consisting of advance directive forms and written educational information versus a one-on-one advance planning intervention consisting of counseling and completing an advance directive with a social worker. MEASUREMENTS: Rate of advance directive completion, assessed by inspection of completed documents. RESULTS: The overall completion rate for advance directives was 26.7% (95% CI, 21.5% to 32.5%), with a higher rate in the counselor-guided group (37.9%) than in the self-guided group (12.8%) (CI of adjusted difference, 15.3 to 34.3 percentage points). This difference persisted across all sites and most subgroups. The advance directive's 4 clinical scenarios found a preference for surrogate decision making in 29% to 34% of written responses. LIMITATIONS: Sampling was limited to a more stable subset of the homeless population in Minneapolis and may have been subject to selection bias. Modest compensation to complete the preintervention survey could have influenced participants to complete advance directives. CONCLUSION: Both a simple and complex intervention successfully engaged a diverse sample of homeless persons in advance care planning. One-on-one assistance significantly increased the completion rate. Homeless persons can respond to an intervention to plan for end-of-life care and can express specific preferences for care or a surrogate decision maker, but additional studies are needed to assess the effect of these directives on subsequent care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional study explored differences in the impact of self-reported coping style, self-esteem and perceived support on the psychological adjustment of homeless and housed female youth. METHOD: Data were obtained from homeless female youth (n = 72, M = 17.5 years) accessing an emergency shelter in a large Canadian urban centre and a comparison group of housed females (n = 102 ; M = 17.2 years) from local high schools who had never resided in a shelter. RESULTS: Homeless youth reported lower self-worth, increased suicidal behaviour, less perceived parental support and higher levels of depressive symptoms and both internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems than housed youth. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that disengagement coping was a significant predictor of depressive symptoms and both internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems in homeless and housed youth. CONCLUSIONS: Findings reflect the merit of considering coping style, parental support and self-worth in the presentation of depressive symptoms and behaviour problems in homeless and housed female youth.

AB  - Homeless youth face various health challenges. The effectiveness of a short intervention to promote sexual health in 572 homeless 16-23-year-olds (M = 19.467+1.89) was conducted using a quasi-experimental repeated measures design. Data collected at three time points (pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention and follow-up) via laptop computers were analyzed using multivariate general linear mixed models. A significant condition by time interaction was found for self-reported AIDS/STD knowledge; intervention participants had higher scores at first post-test. Females scored significantly higher on cognitive and behavioral outcomes while males reported significantly more sexual risk-taking behaviors. Findings support gender-specific interventions.

AB  - Objective: To assess the prevalence of household food insecurity (FI) in France and to describe its associations with socio-economic factors, health behaviours, diet quality and cost (estimated using mean food prices).Design: Cross-sectional nationally representative survey. FI was assessed using an adapted version of the US Department of Agriculture's Food Insufficiency Indicator; dietary intake was assessed using a 7 d open-ended food record; and individual demographic, socio-economic and behavioural variables were assessed using self-administered questionnaires and interviews. Individuals experiencing FI were compared with food-secure individuals, the latter being divided into four categories according to quartiles of their income per consumption unit (FS1 to FS4). Differences among categories were analysed using χ² tests, ANOVA and tests for trend.Setting: Individual and National Dietary Survey (INCA2), 2006-2007.Subjects: Adults aged 18-79 years (n 2624).Results: Individuals experiencing FI represented 12·2% of the population. They were on average younger, more frequently women and single parents with children compared with those in the other four categories. Their mean income per consumption unit was higher than that in the FS1 category, but they reported poorer material and housing conditions. The prevalence of smoking and the mean daily time spent watching television were also higher in the FI category. No significant difference among categories was found for energy intake, but mean intakes of fruits, vegetables and fish were lower, and diet quality was slightly but significantly poorer in the FI category. Daily diet cost was also lower in the FI category.Conclusions: France is not spared by FI. FI should be routinely monitored at the national level and research should be promoted to identify effective strategies to reduce nutrition inequalities in France.

AB  - Objective: We investigated factors accounting for the consistently higher levels of household food insecurity reported by women in Canada.Design: Two cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey for the years 2005/2006 and 2007/2008 were pooled to examine the association between household food insecurity, measured using the Household Food Security Survey Module and other metrics, and respondent sex. We stratified households as married/cohabiting (in which case, the household respondent was chosen randomly) or non-married (single/widowed/separated/divorced) and adjusted for differences in household characteristics, including the presence of children.Setting: Canada.Subjects: Analysis was restricted to households dependent on employment/self-employment and whose reported annual household income was below $CAN 100,000. Exclusions included respondents less than 18 years of age, any welfare receipt, and missing food insecurity, marital status, income source and amount, or household composition data.Results: For non-married households, increased food insecurity in female- v. male-led households was accounted for by significant differences in household socio-economic characteristics. In contrast, in married/cohabiting households with or without children, higher food insecurity rates were reported when the respondent was female and neither respondent characteristics nor socio-economic factors accounted for the differences.Conclusions: Higher rates of food insecurity in non-married households in Canada are largely attributable to women's socio-economic disadvantage. In married households, women appear to report higher levels of food insecurity than men. These findings suggest a possible bias in the measurement of population-level household food insecurity in surveys that do not account for the sex of the respondent in married/cohabiting households.

AB  - While teachers are heralded as key drivers of student learning outcomes, little attention has been paid to teachers' mental health, especially in less-developed countries such as Ghana. Professional background, workplace environment, and personal life stressors may threaten teachers' mental health and subsequent effectiveness in the classroom. The objectives of this study were to investigate 1) whether and how professional background, workplace environment, and personal life stressors predicted teachers' anxiety and depressive symptoms, and 2) whether participation in a professional development intervention predicted change in teachers' symptoms over the course of one school year in Ghana. We used multilevel models to examine predictors of depressive and anxiety symptoms among 444 kindergarten teachers (98% female; age range: 18-69) who participated in the Quality Preschool for Ghana (QP4G) Study. QP4G was a school-randomized control trial (n = 108 public schools; n = 132 private schools) evaluating a one-year teacher professional development intervention program implemented with and without parental-awareness meetings. Teacher depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed at baseline before the intervention and at the end of the school year. Poor workplace environment was associated with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms. Social support also predicted symptoms, with lack of support from students' parents and being new to the local community associated with more anxiety symptoms. Within teachers' personal lives, household food insecurity predicted more depressive symptoms. Finally, anxiety and depressive symptoms increased for all teachers over the school year. However, randomization to either intervention was linked to a significantly smaller increase in symptoms over the school year. Results suggest that teachers' personal and professional lives are consequential for their mental health, and that professional development interventions that provide training and in-class coaching and parent engagement may benefit teachers' mental health. • Workplace conditions predicted depressive symptoms among teachers in Ghana. • Personal life hardships were linked to more depressive symptoms. • Parent support and workplace conditions predicted anxiety symptoms. • A randomized professional development intervention predicted fewer symptoms over time.

AB  - Objective: Understanding factors associated with heavy drinking among homeless youth is important for prevention efforts. Social networks are associated with drinking among homeless youth, and studies have called for attention to racial differences in networks that may affect drinking behavior. This study investigates differences in network characteristics by the racial background of homeless youth, and associations of network characteristics with heavy drinking. (Heavy drinking was defined as having five or more drinks of alcohol in a row within a couple of hours on at least one day within the past 30 days.)Method: A probability sample of 235 Black and White homeless youths ages 13-24 were interviewed in Los Angeles County. We used chi-square or one-way analysis of variance tests to examine network differences by race and logistic regressions to identify network correlates of heavy drinking among Black and White homeless youth.Results: The networks of Black youth included significantly more relatives and students who attend school regularly, whereas the networks of White youth were more likely to include homeless persons, relatives who drink to intoxication, and peers who drink to intoxication. Having peers who drink heavily was significantly associated with heavy drinking only among White youth. For all homeless youth, having more students in the network who regularly attend school was associated with less risk of heavy drinking.Conclusions: This study is the first to our knowledge to investigate racial differences in network characteristics and associations of network characteristics with heavy drinking among homeless youth. White homeless youth may benefit from interventions that reduce their ties with peers who drink. Enhancing ties to school-involved peers may be a promising intervention focus for both Black and White homeless youth.

AB  - We evaluated the impact of an HIV prevention intervention combining street outreach, storefront prevention services, and subculture-specific activities, for homeless, runaway, and street youth. Using systematic, street-based sampling techniques, we conducted 1,146 interviews in cross-sectional surveys at intervention and comparison sites prior to and during intervention implementation. Youth in both sites reported high rates of risky sexual and injection drug use behaviors. In logistic regression the intervention did not impact HIV risk behaviors, but was independently associated with increased outreach worker (OW) contact and referrals for services. Higher levels of OW contact were associated with following through with HIV-related referrals and using new syringes. Youth-oriented needle exchange increased use of new syringes. While our study did not demonstrate an intervention effect on HIV risk behaviors, intensive, subculture-specific outreach, including needle exchange, may improve the lives of street youth.

AB  - We performed a quasi-experiment to assess the effects of a focused health care intervention delivered in transitional housing facilities in Sacramento, California. Four transitional housing facilities (THFs) receiving the intervention were compared with 2 THFs that did not receive it. A multidisciplinary team provided a diverse package of services to residents at the intervention sites. Residents at comparison sites received usual care. Survey and physical examination data were collected in repeated cross-sectional surveys at baseline (pre-intervention) and after 6 and 18 months of follow-up (post-intervention). Using analysis of covariance techniques, our statistical models showed improved odds of receiving recommended gynecologic preventive care and decreased odds of frequent Emergency Department use at 18 months among residents at the intervention sites. At 6 months, residents at the intervention sites also experienced improved blood pressure control. There was no intervention effect on residents' access to specialists or on physical functioning, mental health, or dental health.

AB  - Homeless youth are at increased risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and HBV vaccine coverage is poor in this group. The purpose of our study was to determine if a shelter-based HBV vaccine program in children and adolescents 2-18 years of age with a randomized controlled trial using a culturally appropriate HBV video could increase HBV vaccine coverage rates. Subjects were randomized to an 8 min HBV video or a control, smoking prevention video. Before exposure to the videos, HBV knowledge, and demographics were assessed in caregivers and adolescents. HBV vaccine no. 1 was offered to all subjects who did not produce a vaccine record; subsequently, an accurate HBV vaccine history was obtained from medical providers. Subjects were asked to return 1 and 3 months after visit 1, HBV vaccine was offered to all with incomplete coverage, and HBV knowledge was reassessed. There were 328 children and adolescents cared for by 170 caregivers enrolled in the study. One hundred and four had incomplete HBV vaccine coverage. Data are reported for all family units with at least one subject needing vaccine. There were 53 children and adolescents randomized to the HBV video vs. 51 to the smoking video. HBV knowledge scores of caregivers improved at Visit no. 2 vs. no. 1 in the HBV video group (p = 0.01) but not in the smoking group (p = 0.82). Similar results were observed for adolescents in the HBV video group (p = 0.05) but not in the smoking group (p = 0.40). Exposure to the HBV video vs the smoking video had a significant effect on return rates for vaccine at Visit no. 2 (59 vs. 31%; p = 0.05) but not at Visit no. 3 (47 vs. 18%, p = 0.06). The shelter-based vaccine program was very effective in increasing HBV coverage rates in the entire group of 328 children and adolescents enrolled in the study, from 68% coverage at baseline to 85% at the conclusion of the study. We conclude that shelter-based HBV vaccine programs can be highly effective in increasing vaccine coverage rates in older children and adolescents. A brief exposure to a culturally appropriate HBV video improves HBV knowledge and may improve return rates for vaccine.

AB  - Objective: Critical Time Intervention (CTI) is a time-limited care coordination intervention designed to reduce homelessness and other adverse outcomes for persons living with serious mental illness during the transition period between institutions and community living. This study assesses whether CTI improves the quality of family relationships between family members and individuals living with serious mental illness, and examines whether changes in quality of family relationship mediated the association between the intervention and psychiatric rehospitalization outcomes. Method: This study utilizes data from a randomized controlled trial that assessed the effect of CTI in preventing homelessness. Following discharge from inpatient psychiatric treatment in New York City, 150 previously homeless persons living with serious mental illness were randomly assigned to receive usual services only or 9 months of CTI in addition to usual services. Results: Findings from mixed-effects regression models indicated that those assigned to the CTI group reported greater frequency of family contact and greater improvement in satisfaction with family relations than the comparison group during the 18-month follow-up period. Mediation analysis revealed that greater improvement in satisfaction with family relations mediated the effect of CTI on psychiatric rehospitalization outcome, but only at a modest level. Conclusion and Implications for Practice: These findings suggest that a relatively brief but targeted intervention delivered at the point of hospital discharge may contribute to strengthening family relations and that improvement in perceived family relationship quality can contribute to a reduction in psychiatric rehospitalization.

AB  - Background: The paper presents two-year findings from a study investigating the effectiveness of Housing First (HF) with assertive community treatment (ACT) in helping individuals with serious mental illness, who are homeless or precariously housed and living in a small city, to become stably housed.Methods: The research design was a parallel group non-blinded RCT with participants randomly assigned after the baseline interview to receive HF with ACT (N = 100) or treatment as usual (TAU; N = 101). Participants were interviewed every 3 months over 21/24 months to investigate changes on a range of housing and psychosocial outcomes. The primary outcomes were housing stability (as defined by a joint function of number of days housed and number of moves) and improvement in community functioning. Secondary predicted outcomes were improvements in self-rated physical and mental health status, substance use problems, quality of life, community integration, and recovery.Results: An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted. Compared to TAU participants, HF participants who entered housing did so more quickly (23.30 versus 88.25 days, d = 1.02, 95% CI [0.50-1.53], p < 0.001), spent a greater proportion of time stably housed (Z = 5.30, p < 0.001, OR = 3.12, 95% CI [1.96-4.27]), and rated the quality of their housing more positively (Z = 4.59, p < 0.001, d = 0.43, 95% CI [0.25-0.62]). HF participants were also more likely to be housed continually in the final 6 months (i.e., 79.57% vs. 55.47%), χ2 (2, n = 170) = 11.46, p = .003, Cramer's V = 0.26, 95% CI [0.14-0.42]). HF participants showed greater gains in quality of life, (Z = 3.83, p < 0.001, ASMD = 0.50, 95% CI [0.24-0.75]), psychological integration (Z = 12.89, p < 0.001, pooled ASMD = 0.91, 95% CI [0.77-1.05]), and perceived recovery (Z = 2.26, p = 0.03, ASMD = 0.39, 95% CI [0.05-0.74]) than TAU participants.Conclusions: The study indicates that HF ends homelessness significantly more rapidly than TAU for a majority of individuals with serious mental illness who have a history of homelessness and live in a small city.

AB  - This study examined the effects of cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBT) on the self-esteem, depression, and self-efficacy of runaway adolescents residing in a shelter in Seoul, South Korea. The study used a control group pretest-posttest design. The experimental group and the control group consisted of 14 and 13 male subjects, respectively, with subjects having been randomly assigned to these groups. The experimental group participated in a CBT that consisted of eight sessions over an 8-week period; the control group did not participate in the program. To examine the effects of the CBT on dependent variables, the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used. The scores on depression decreased significantly ( z = -2.325, p = .02) and those on self-efficacy increased significantly ( z = -2.098, p = .03) after the intervention in the experimental group. There was no significant change on self-esteem ( z = -1.19, p = .23). In the control group, the scores on depression, self-esteem, and self-efficacy did not change significantly after the intervention period. The CBT developed in this study consisted of structured and specific content that could be usefully applied to runaway adolescents residing in a shelter. Copyright © 2005 by Elsevier Science (USA).

AB  - The high rates of substance use among American adolescents are challenging; however, runaway youth are at particularly high-risk for substance use. Runaway youth utilizing two service sectors, emergency crisis shelters and juvenile detention centers, were recruited to evaluate differences in risk factors associated with substance use. Findings demonstrate that youth admitted to juvenile detention (n = 121) had proportionally higher levels of problem behaviors, including substance use, than youth admitted to shelter services (n = 156). Both groups of youth have significantly higher levels of substance use than national estimates. The most significant risk factor for alcohol and marijuana use among youth in both groups was using other substances. Addressing issues of substance abuse among runaway youth must be a prime objective for future research and treatment for this high-risk population.

AB  - Background Young drug misusers and the homeless both have a greater risk of death than their peers. This study sought to estimate the additional impact of homelessness on the risk of death for young drugs misusers. Methods From all admissions to NHS hospitals in Scotland between 1986 and 2001, those that were: drug misuse related, for people born between 1970 and 1986 and aged over 15 years (n=13 303), were selected. All subsequent admissions and registrations of death were linked to this dataset. Each admission was coded as homeless if the health board of residence was coded as 'no fixed abode'. 5-year survival after an admission was modelled using (1) life table and (2) proportional hazard models and then (3) differences in causes of deaths were explored. Results Immediately after a drugs-related hospital admission there was no difference in survival between the homeless and those with a 'fixed address'. However, over a 3-year period the risk for those who were homeless was 3.5 times greater (CI 95% 1.2 to 12.8). This elevated risk seemed to be particularly focused on the second year after an admission. The causes of death were similar for the two groups. Conclusion Although a homeless hospital admission is associated with a greater risk of death for young drug users, it is also a point in time when a young person is in contact with public services. An attempt to link their discharge with housing services would seem a potentially productive policy.

AB  - PURPOSE. To explore relationships and group differences in attachment-related constructs (social connectedness and social support) and sexual health behaviors in a sample of homeless youth. DESIGN AND METHODS. An exploratory design, this study analyzed baseline data from an ongoing intervention study. Survey data were collected by audio, computer-assisted self-interview (A-CASI) from a nonprobability sample of homeless youth (n = 176). RESULTS. Social connectedness was positively correlated with period of time homeless, while social support was positively related to sexual self-concept and to self-efficacy and intention to use condoms. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS. The street group that homeless youth identify with may be a potential resource for peer-mentoring and skill-building regarding healthy sexual behavior.

AB  - Development of a global HIV vaccine will require enrollment of a large number of adults and adolescents in clinical trials. Involvement of homeless young adults in these trials will be particularly important because they often practice high-risk behaviors and are disproportionately infected by HIV. This qualitative study explores factors that might affect future participation of homeless 18- to 24-year-olds of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds in HIV vaccine trials (HIVVTs). Twenty males and females attended focus groups. Participants expressed concern about seroconversion, the trustworthiness of the researchers and/or government agencies conducting trials, vaccine side effects, and possible negative behavior change as a result of being vaccinated. Understanding the personal perspectives of high-risk young adults will enable researchers to tailor protocols to their individual needs and cultural values and, in so doing, potentially enhance willingness to participate in HIVVTs.

AB  - Homeless youths are often vulnerable to limited support resources and loneliness. Peers are a potent source of social support. A support intervention for homeless youths was designed to optimize peer influence and was pilot tested. The intervention was based on an initial assessment of support needs and intervention preferences from the perspective of 36 homeless youths and 27 service providers. Based on the results, a 20-week pilot intervention program was designed, consisting of 4 support groups, optional one-on-one support, group recreational activities, and meals. Support was provided by professional and peer mentors, including formerly homeless youths. A total of 56 homeless youths aged 16 to 24 took part. Participants completed pre-, mid-, and post-test quantitative measures and qualitative interviews. In spite of challenges due primarily to attrition, the youths reported enhanced health behaviours, improved mental well-being, decreased loneliness, expanded social network, increased coping skills, enhanced self-efficacy, and diminished use of drugs and alcohol. Further research could focus on replication at other sites with a larger sample.

AB  - Food insecurity contributes to various stress-related health problems and previous research found that its association with mental illness is stronger in more affluent countries. We hypothesised that this pattern is a function of relative deprivation whereby the severity of individual food insecurity relative to others in a reference group determines its associations with mental health and wellbeing after differences in absolute food insecurity are controlled for. Using survey data from the Gallup World Poll collected in 160 countries and a measure of relative deprivation (Yitzhaki index), we found that relative food insecurity—based on national or regional reference groups—related to more mental health symptoms, lower positive wellbeing and lower life satisfaction after controlling for absolute food insecurity, household income, and country differences. Our analysis also found that relative food insecurity was more strongly related to mental health and wellbeing where the prevalence of food insecurity was lower. The findings underscore the negative health consequences of material deprivation and unfavourable social comparisons. Consistent with relative deprivation theory, individuals who live with constant worries about not getting enough food, have to skip meals, or face chronic hunger are deprived of material and social resources that support mental health and wellbeing, especially in settings where food insecurity is less common and potentially more stigmatised. The implications of these findings for global food policy and surveillance efforts are discussed. • Relative food insecurity relates to poor mental health and reduced wellbeing. • Associations are significant after controlling for absolute food insecurity and income. • Associations are stronger where the prevalence of food insecurity is lower. • The mental health consequences of food insecurity are sensitive to social contexts.

The authors noted gender differences for health-seeking behaviors, with most male youth reporting embarrassment about needing to seek care, and female youth reporting fears over safety issues while ill and homeless. Most youth under age 18 stated that they were often denied health care at hospitals because of their underage status, and youth over age 18 stated that health care bills contributed to their inability to obtain stable housing. Street-based youth reported more illnesses related to substance use and greater reliance on emergency departments for health care than clinic-based youth did. Policies and programs focused on improving the health of homeless youth need to address the differences in illness experiences by age, gender, and sampling site.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the HIV case finding strategies used by the Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS), Adolescent HIV Outreach and Treatment programs, the populations of youth they were able to reach, and the populations of HIV-positive youth they were able to identify. METHODS: Program specifications from five programs located in four major metropolitan centers were contrasted. Four of the programs also provided outcome data for HIV counseling and testing outcome numbers, demographic and risk profile data for youth who underwent HIV testing, and mode of infection of HIV-positive youth. RESULTS: The program outcomes were discussed in terms of similarities and differences in outreach methods (e.g., peer workers, time of outreach, etc.), geographic settings (i.e., mobile van, institutional settings, community locations), individual characteristics (e.g., pregnant women) and youth subcultures (i.e., gay/transgendered, incarcerated juveniles, homeless). CONCLUSIONS: Because HIV-positive adolescents will constitutionally remain a 'hidden population,' a great deal of time and effort will continue to need to go into the front end of outreach, counseling and testing. Specific guidance and recommendations for locating HIV-positive youth were provided to program designers for each type of outreach strategy.

AB  - Objective: This study compared characteristics of visits to emergency rooms (ERs) for mental and substance use disorders and for physical health conditions to establish a baseline against which to measure changes after full implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and parity legislation.Methods: The retrospective, cross-sectional analysis fit a logistic regression model to pooled data comprising 193,526 observations from National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) data from 2005 to 2011.Results: ER visits for mental or substance use disorders increased from 27.9 per 1,000 ER visits in 2005 to 35.1 in 2011. Homeless persons and nursing home residents had the highest rates of such visits-173.7 and 95.2 per 1,000 ER visits, respectively, in 2011.Conclusions: Understanding differences in profiles of ER visits on the basis of the reason for the visit can inform the design of more cost-effective policies to guide ER intake, after further implementation of the ACA and parity legislation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Community organizers and activists draw on multiple traditions of community building and collective action in attempts to galvanize change. The diversity of perspectives on social change processes indicates corresponding differences in perspectives on systems and what is required to change them. Twenty-two in-depth interviews with community organizers and activists in the Midwestern USA were conducted to identify differences in perspectives on systems change efforts. Four models used by organizers were identified: action/issue-centric, identity-centric, relationship-centric, and organizing-development. Strategies for recruitment, issue selection, leadership determination, and action were compared across models. Analyses revealed that some models might be better suited to action on certain issues (e.g. identity-centric models when organizing around homelessness), whereas others may have advantages for use in certain settings (e.g. relationship-centric models in congregations). These findings suggest that practitioners and scholars should pay close attention to contextual factors and focal issues when determining strategies for creating systems change.

AB  - We compared demographics, socioeconomic status, and food insecurity between households with and without recent orphans in a region of high HIV/AIDS mortality in South Africa. We recruited a cohort of 197 recent orphans and 528 non-orphans aged 9–15 years and their households using stratified cluster sampling. Households were classified into three groups: orphan-only (N = 50), non-orphan-only (N = 377), and mixed (N = 210). Between September 2004 and May 2007, households were interviewed three times regarding demographics, income and assets, and food insecurity. Baseline bivariate associations were assessed using chi-square test andt-test. Longitudinal bivariate associations and multivariate models were tested using generalized estimating equations. At baseline, mixed households generally exhibited greater characteristics of vulnerability than orphan-only and non-orphan-only households. They were larger, had older, less-educated household heads, and reported a much smaller annual per capita income. Orphan households were more likely to report a death in the previous year and less likely to have an adult employed. These differences persisted over the study. Even non-orphan-only households exhibited characteristics of vulnerability, with 14% reporting a death one year before baseline, 45% of whom were prime-age adults. At baseline, a much smaller proportion of orphan households reported receiving the child support grant than the other household types, but notably, there were no differences among households in receipt of the grant by Round 3. Household food insecurity was highly prevalent: more than one in five orphan-only and mixed households reported being food insecure in the previous month. These findings suggest that the effects of HIV/AIDS only exacerbate existing high levels of poverty in the district, as virtually all households are vulnerable regardless of orphan status. Community-level programs must help families address a spectrum of needs, including food security, caregiving, and financial support, as well as better target social welfare grants and make them more accessible to vulnerable households.

AB  - Background: Homeless persons experience excess mortality, but US-based studies on this topic are outdated or lack information about causes of death. To our knowledge, no studies have examined shifts in causes of death for this population over time.Methods: We assessed all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates in a cohort of 28 033 adults 18 years or older who were seen at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2008. Deaths were identified through probabilistic linkage to the Massachusetts death occurrence files. We compared mortality rates in this cohort with rates in the 2003-2008 Massachusetts population and a 1988-1993 cohort of homeless adults in Boston using standardized rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals.Results: A total of 1302 deaths occurred during 90 450 person-years of observation. Drug overdose (n = 219), cancer (n = 206), and heart disease (n = 203) were the major causes of death. Drug overdose accounted for one-third of deaths among adults younger than 45 years. Opioids were implicated in 81% of overdose deaths. Mortality rates were higher among whites than nonwhites. Compared with Massachusetts adults, mortality disparities were most pronounced among younger individuals, with rates about 9-fold higher in 25- to 44-year-olds and 4.5-fold higher in 45- to 64-year-olds. In comparison with 1988-1993 rates, reductions in deaths from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were offset by 3- and 2-fold increases in deaths owing to drug overdose and psychoactive substance use disorders, resulting in no significant difference in overall mortality.Conclusions: The all-cause mortality rate among homeless adults in Boston remains high and unchanged since 1988 to 1993 despite a major interim expansion in clinical services. Drug overdose has replaced HIV as the emerging epidemic. Interventions to reduce mortality in this population should include behavioral health integration into primary medical care, public health initiatives to prevent and reverse drug overdose, and social policy measures to end homelessness.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the association among suicide behaviors, high-risk behaviors, coping style, and psychological adjustment (i.e., depressive symptomatology, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems) in homeless and non-homeless adolescent males (aged 16 to 19 years). METHODS: Data were obtained from 100 homeless youth accessing an emergency shelter (Ottawa, ON). The comparison group was comprised of 70 youth accessing local community drop-in centers that lived with their parent(s)/guardian(s) and had never stayed in a shelter. Data were analyzed using Chi-square, Student's t-tests, and regression statistics. RESULTS: Relative to non-homeless youth, homeless youth were more likely to report drug, alcohol, and tobacco use, legal problems, academic difficulties, and mental health problems. Homeless youth presented with a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation, past suicide attempts, depressive symptomatology, and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Disengagement coping was a predictor of suicidal ideation, past attempts, depressive symptoms and both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in homeless youth. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to non-homeless youth, findings indicate that homeless youth reported greater use of a disengaging coping style and are at greater risk for high-risk behaviors, past suicide attempts, and clinically elevated levels of depressive symptoms and behavior problems.

AB  - Objective: To reduce mental health symptoms and high-risk behaviors and increase social support and service utilization among street-living youth, the authors conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility of the social enterprise intervention (SEI) at a homeless youth agency. Method: Convenience sampling was used to recruit 16 street-living youth from the agency. SEI participants received 7 months of vocational and small business training and service referrals. A comparison sample of 12 agency youth was used. Results: Findings from independent sample t tests demonstrate that SEI participants displayed significant improvements at 9 months in life satisfaction, family contact, peer support, and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Preliminary findings suggest that the SEI was feasible within the agency setting and associated with higher mental health and social outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the impact of a federally funded housing and employment demonstration program (Los Angeles' Homeless Opportunity Providing Employment [LA's HOPE]) for homeless adults with mental illness. METHODS: The sample included all participants enrolled between July 1, 2004, and May 17, 2005, in one of 18 Los Angeles County community mental health centers offering a state-funded program (AB2034) to reduce homelessness among people with serious mental illness. Fifty-six demonstration clients enrolled in three centers received housing and special employment supports. Their outcomes were compared with those of 415 clients enrolled in the county's other 15 AB2034 programs during the same period. Data included demographic characteristics, circumstances at enrollment and in the previous 12 months, and outcomes for at least 13 months after enrollment. Outcomes analyses used propensity score matching. RESULTS: Demonstration clients got and kept housing and worked in paid employment and employment-related activities at rates significantly higher than those of the comparison group. Other than client group, no personal characteristics made any systematic difference to employment outcomes. Several personal characteristics-race and ethnicity, preenrollment length of homelessness, and whether the client had a co-occurring substance use disorder-affected housing outcomes independently of client group. CONCLUSIONS: The demonstration provided the structure and resources to help clients achieve better housing and employment outcomes than the comparison group had. The outcomes for LA's HOPE clients suggest that this very challenged population can achieve improved work outcomes if programs devote adequate and appropriate resources to help them.

AB  - Using cluster analysis techniques, we identified two distinct clusters of newly homeless adolescents in Los Angeles (n = 261): those who are protected and doing relatively well while out of home with more protective than risk factors, and those who are risky with more risk than protective factors. The objective of this study was to examine the trajectories of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviors and exiting homelessness among protected newly homeless adolescents, compared to those who are classified as risky. HIV risk behavior included unprotected sex, having multiple sex partners and hard drug use. Logistic regression mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the trajectories of HIV risk behaviors and exiting homelessness over time. The adolescents in the protected group reported significantly less unprotected sex ( p = 0.0156), being abstinent or monogamous ( p < 0.0001) and less hard drug use ( p < 0.0001) compared to the adolescents in the risky group. In addition, the protected group reported more “exiting homelessness”, compared to the risky group ( p = 0.0007). However, the differences in the level of unprotected sex between the protected and risky groups decreased over time. Our findings confirm the notion that newly homeless adolescents are indeed heterogeneous. Given that the risk behavior profiles of protected group merges to the risky group over time, our findings underscore the need to mount tailored interventions to be designed for the protected group early in the process.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the effect of time spent homeless on young people's substance use and use of drug and alcohol services in two countries with contrasting policy and service environments. METHODS: A crossnational survey was conducted of recently homeless and experienced homeless young people in Melbourne (N = 674) and Los Angeles (N = 620). Questions were asked about alcohol and drug use in the past 3 months, frequency of use, injecting drug use, drug dependency, and perceived need for, and use of, drug and alcohol services. Data were analyzed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Substantial numbers of young people reported use of alcohol and drugs. More Australians than Americans and more experienced than newly homeless reported drug use, although there were no differences in frequency of use in the past 3 months. Polydrug use was common, as were injecting drugs and responses that signified drug dependency. All were more common among Australians and experienced homeless young people. A substantial number of young people had 'ever' taken part in a drug or alcohol program, but only a minority believed that they needed help from services. Of these, only a minority had sought help. This was particularly so among those who were classified as drug dependent. Reasons for failure to seek help varied. CONCLUSION: Substance use is alarmingly high compared to national samples of young people, especially among those who had been homeless for longer periods. Programs to reduce substance use must take account of the prevailing drug cultures, as well as different subgroups of the population.

AB  - Treatment evaluation for alcohol problem, runaway adolescents and their families is rare. This study recruited primary alcohol problem adolescents (N = 119) and their primary caretakers from two runaway shelters and assigned them to (a) home-based ecologically based family therapy (EBFT), (b) office-based functional family therapy (FFT), or (c) service as usual (SAU) through the shelter. Findings showed that both home-based EBFT and office-based FFT significantly reduced alcohol and drug use compared with SAU at 15-month postbaseline. Measures of family and adolescent functioning improved over time in all groups. However, significant differences among the home- and office-based interventions were found for treatment engagement and moderators of outcome.

AB  - Youth suicide is a major global mental health problem. This review looks at the epidemiology, risk and protective factors associated with youth suicide, and global strategies to address this important issue. To better understand factors contributing to youth suicide, global gender differences in suicide were examined. Global rates of suicide amongst young men are higher than young women. However, there are anomalously higher rates of female youth suicide in India and China, and possible causes of this are examined further. It is likely that underestimation of youth suicide is a major factor affecting the accuracy of suicide epidemiology. Risk factors for youth suicide are varied. Psychiatric factors include various psychiatric illnesses, substance use (particularly amongst refugee and homeless youth). Psychosocial risk factors include family conflict, physical and sexual childhood abuse, isolation, socioeconomic disadvantage, discrimination and acculturation. Vulnerable populations are at increased risk, including refugee/immigrant/indigenous youth, those in foster care and homeless youth. Protective factors can include family cohesion and strong interpersonal relationships, as well as increased access to care. Global strategies to prevent youth suicide include reducing lethal means to suicide and reducing harmful media reporting. Various psychosocial interventions may be helpful, including individual support, and family, school and community based interventions. Strategies can also increase evaluation of psychiatric disorders and access to care, as well as promote psycho-education and reduce stigma against mental illness.

AB  - Many preventive intervention studies with adolescents address high-risk behaviors such as drug and alcohol use, and unprotected sex. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are the gold standard methodology used to test the effectiveness of these behavioral interventions. Interventions outside the rigidly described protocol are prohibited. However, there are ethical challenges to implementing inflexible intervention protocols, especially when the target population is young, experiences many stressful events, and lives in a resource-poor environment. Teens who are at high risk for substance use or sexual risk behaviors tend to be at risk for other problems such as exposure to violence, sexual and physical abuse, depression, and homelessness. How should investigators deal with the psychological and social needs of teenagers in prevention programs in an ethically appropriate way and at the same time preserve the validity of RCT results? We have identified program characteristics, participant characteristics, interaction with parents, and problems with adolescents not in the study as sources of ethical dilemmas in RCT with at-risk adolescents. As a result of our experience, we recommend that every behavioral intervention study develop an ethics protocol, which should include rules for providing help to participants, has contact information for experts to provide guidance, and an emergency procedure for dealing with life threatening situations. In addition, studies should have a resource manual, train research staff in these ethical issues, and work with a data safety and monitoring board or ethics committee.

AB  - Runaway youth report a broader range and higher severity of substance-related, mental health and family problems relative to non-runaway youth. Most studies to date have collected self-report data on the family and social history; virtually no research has examined treatment effectiveness with this population. This study is a treatment development project in which 124 runaway youth were randomly assigned to (1) ecologically based family therapy (EBFT) or (2) service as usual (SAU) through a shelter. Youth completed an intake, posttreatment, 6 and 12 months follow-up assessment. Youth assigned to EBFT reported greater reductions in overall substance abuse compared to youth assigned to SAU while other problem areas improved in both conditions. Findings suggest that EBFT is an efficacious intervention for this relatively severe population of youth.

AB  - Samples of adolescents from a homeless shelter (n = 62), detention center (n = 70), and two high schools in Anchorage, Alaska (n = 207) were surveyed regarding HIV risk, knowledge and attitudes. Participants from the three groups differed markedly in patterns of risk behavior, with delinquent and homeless youths consistently reporting higher levels of risky behavior than those in the comparison group. However, differences between the homeless and delinquent youth on risk behaviors, knowledge and attitudes, suggest that HIV prevention efforts are more likely to succeed if they address the specific needs of these populations. An unusual trend in alcohol and marijuana use was also uncovered among all three groups surveyed; regular use of marijuana was consistently reported as more frequent than regular alcohol use. Implications for future research and HIV prevention targeting homeless and delinquent youth in Alaska, and in general, are discussed.

AB  - PROBLEM: Street-involved youth experience a range of mental health problems with elevated rates of psychiatric disorders compared with non-homeless youth. The overall objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of a relationship-based intervention for homeless youth receiving services from agencies in downtown Toronto. METHODS: The final sample included 15 homeless youth who met the study inclusion criteria. The intervention and comparison groups were compared at baseline and post-treatment on measures of mental health symptoms, hopelessness, self-esteem, resilience, and social connectedness. FINDINGS: Participants receiving the intervention demonstrated a significant improvement in social connectedness, with a trend toward decreased hopelessness. Those participants who did not receive the intervention did not demonstrate any improvements in social connectedness and hopelessness. CONCLUSION: This preliminary pilot study suggests that providing a relationship-based intervention to street-involved youth may offer promise to strengthen social relationships and to mitigate overwhelming hopelessness and despair.

AB  - There have been only a limited number of studies that examine drug use among homeless youth and there have been no studies to date on drug use with adolescents living in homeless families. This study examined predictors of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use with homeless adolescents and preadolescents (N = 234) living in shelters for homeless families. Structured interviews were conducted on self-reported drug use, as well as background variables, social environmental influences, and individual characteristics hypothesized to promote drug use. Logistic-regression analyses revealed that social influences (friends and family drug use) are strong predictors of experimental drug use and intentions to use drugs, as are several psychological factors (psychological well-being, assertiveness, and social support). Implications of the findings for effective prevention programs for homeless and other high risk youth are discussed.

AB  - This paper presents three exploratory studies of life skills interventions (employment, money management or food/nutrition) with 73 homeless individuals from four shelters and supportive housing programs located in the urban Midwest for youth, victims of domestic violence and adults with mental illness. The Ansell Casey Life Skills Assessment was administered prior to the eight group and individual sessions. Quizzes and posttests indicated clinical change in all groups, with statistical significance in the domestic violence group. The intervention implementation, challenges encountered, and strategies developed for implementing shelter-based interventions are discussed. Recommendations for successfully providing collaborative university-shelter clinical interventions are provided.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine effects of the Runaway Intervention Program (RIP), a strengths-based home visiting, case management, and group support program for sexually assaulted or exploited young runaway girls; staffed by advanced-practice nurses, RIP aims to restore healthy developmental trajectories by reestablishing protective factors, reducing trauma responses, and lowering risk behaviors that are common sequelae of sexual violence. METHODS: Quasi-experimental study of RIP girls (N = 68) ages 12 to 15 (mean, 13.75 years), assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months for changes in family and school connectedness, other adult caring, self-esteem, emotional distress, suicidality, recent substance use, plus risky sexual behaviors. Responses at each time were also compared to nonabused and abused urban ninth-grade girls (mean age, 14.64, N = 12,775) from the 2004 Minnesota Student Survey (MSS). Analyses used paired t-tests, McNemars test, Wilcoxon sign-rank, chi-square, and Pearson's correlations. RESULTS: At entry, RIP girls were most like sexually abused MSS peers, with lower levels of protective factors and higher levels of distress and risk behaviors than nonabused MSS girls (p < .05 to p < .01). However, they saw significant improvements by 6 and 12 months, such that all measures of protective factors, positive development, distress, and risk behaviors more closely resembled nonabused MSS girls by 12 months. Of equal note, RIP girls with the greatest emotional distress, the lowest levels of connectedness, and lowest self-esteem at baseline demonstrated the greatest improvement (all p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: This appears to be a promising intervention for restoring sexually abused runaway girls to a healthy developmental trajectory.

AB  - This cross-sectional study explores the utility of community-level data for accurately identifying patients with social risks by comparing the social deprivation index score for the census tract where a patient lives with patient-level social risk screening data. Key Points: Question: Can community-level data (eg, social deprivation index score of the census tract where patients live) accurately identify patient-level social risks? Findings: In this cross-sectional study including 36 578 patients, 10 858 (29.7%) screened positive for 1 or more social risks; 42% of patients with at least 1 social risk lived in neighborhoods not defined as disadvantaged. Meaning: Using community-level data to guide patient-level activities may result in missing some patients who can benefit from social risk–targeted or social risk–informed care. Importance: Responding to the substantial research on the relationship between social risk factors and health, enthusiasm has grown around social risk screening in health care settings, and numerous US health systems are experimenting with social risk screening initiatives. In the absence of standard social risk screening recommendations, some health systems are exploring using publicly available community-level data to identify patients who live in the most vulnerable communities as a way to characterize patient social and economic contexts, identify patients with potential social risks, and/or to target social risk screening efforts. Objective: To explore the utility of community-level data for accurately identifying patients with social risks by comparing the social deprivation index score for the census tract where a patient lives with patient-level social risk screening data. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study using patient-level social risk screening data from the electronic health records of a national network of community health centers between June 24, 2016, and November 15, 2018, linked to geocoded community-level data from publicly available sources. Eligible patients were those with a recorded response to social risk screening questions about food, housing, and/or financial resource strain, and a valid address of sufficient quality for geocoding. Exposures: Social risk screening documented in the electronic health record. Main Outcomes and Measures: Community-level social risk was assessed using census tract–level social deprivation index score stratified by quartile. Patient-level social risks were identified using food insecurity, housing insecurity, and financial resource strain screening responses. Results: The final study sample included 36 578 patients from 13 US states; 22 113 (60.5%) received public insurance, 21 181 (57.9%) were female, 17 578 (48.1%) were White, and 10 918 (29.8%) were Black. Although 6516 (60.0%) of those with at least 1 social risk factor were in the most deprived quartile of census tracts, patients with social risk factors lived in all census tracts. Overall, the accuracy of the community-level data for identifying patients with and without social risks was 48.0%. Conclusions and Relevance: Although there is overlap, patient-level and community-level approaches for assessing patient social risks are not equivalent. Using community-level data to guide patient-level activities may mean that some patients who could benefit from targeted interventions or care adjustments would not be identified.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this research were to explore homeless youths' histories of exposure to violence, perpetration of violence, and fear of violent victimization, and to examine the extent to which these constructs are associated with demographic variables. METHODS: A sample of 432 youth (between 13 and 23 years old) who were homeless or at imminent risk for homelessness were sampled from both service and street sites. The percentage of youth who reported exposure to each type of violence was calculated. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine differences in the risk of exposure to violence across gender, ethnicity, age, and length of time homeless. RESULTS: Respondents reported a high rate of exposure to violence. Female respondents reported levels of exposure to violence that were as high as those reported by males. Females were more likely to report having been sexually assaulted and fearing victimization, and tended to be less likely to report perpetrating violence. With a few exceptions, ethnic identity was not a significant predictor of exposure to violence or fear of victimization. Age tended to be inversely associated with risk of exposure to violence. Length of time homeless was not associated with fear of victimization. CONCLUSIONS: Homeless youth are at high risk for exposure to a variety of forms violence as both witnesses and victims. The overall rates of exposure to violence and patterns of association with demographic variables are significantly higher than those reported in national samples of adolescents.

AB  - According to a cohort study conducted in Montréal, Québec from 1995 to 2000, the mortality rate among street youth was 921/100,000 person-years. Several new community initiatives aiming to increase access to housing and to social and health services for the homeless were implemented in the city between 2000 and 2003. This study aims to update the mortality rate estimate for the period 2001-2006 and to examine factors that could explain a difference between rates, if any. A second cohort study was conducted between 2001 and 2006. The Cohort 2 mortality rate was computed and compared with the Cohort 1 rate. Several analyses were then carried out: (1) mortality rates in the general population were compared with street youth rates using standardized mortality ratios (SMR); (2) Cohorts 1 and 2 distributions of risk factors for mortality were examined, and their effects were assessed using multivariate proportional hazards regression analyses carried out on a combined Cohorts 1 and 2 dataset. Mortality rate among street youth decreased by 79% while it declined by only 19% in the general population; the SMR for Cohort 1 was higher than for Cohort 2 (11.6 versus 3.0). Multivariate proportional hazards regression analyses yielded estimates that were close to the model's estimates based on Cohort 1 data only, and participation in Cohort 1 was an independent predictor of mortality, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 9.0. The mortality decline cannot be completely explained by a similar decrease among the general population or by a difference in distribution of risk factors for mortality between the two cohorts. Field workers suggested that the decrease in heroin consumption they had observed in the streets might have contributed to the mortality decline. We then performed additional analyses which showed that even though the proportion of street youth currently using heroin decreased significantly between 1995 and 2005, the association between heroin use and mortality was not significant (adjusted hazard ratio of 0.9; 95% CI, 0.4 to 2.3). It seems that various factors could have contributed to the decline in mortality rates among street youth, one plausible factor being the implementation of new services for the homeless. This study underscores the importance of monitoring risky behaviors among vulnerable populations to ensure that morbidity and mortality data among these populations is correctly interpreted. Setting up a system to monitor the drug market could improve the quality of information collected.

AB  - Background: One of the most controversial aspects of New York City's highly effective TB control program is the use of public health law and court-ordered detention to treat persistently recalcitrant patients with active TB. We now report on characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing detention for completion of TB treatment due to nonadherence in New York City from 2002 through 2009.Methods: A retrospective cohort study was designed to compare patients undergoing court-ordered detention (n = 79) and time-matched control subjects undergoing TB treatment in outpatient directly observed therapy (DOT) at Bellevue Hospital in New York City.Results: From January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2009, 79 patients underwent court-ordered detention for TB treatment. Compared with patients completing treatment in DOT, univariate analysis found that detainees were younger; more likely to be of minority race/ethnicity; to have a history of substance abuse, tobacco use, homelessness, incarceration, HIV infection; and to be born in the United States. Multivariate analysis adjusting for other variables found smear positivity (OR = 3.93; 95% CI, 1.05-14.75; P = .04), mental illness (OR = 5.80; 95% CI, 1.18-28.51; P = .03), and substance abuse (OR = 9.25; 95% CI, 2.81-30.39; P < .01) to be the strongest independent predictors of likelihood of detention. Of those initially detained, 46 (58%) completed treatment during inpatient detention, 29(37%) completed treatment under outpatient court-ordered DOT, and four died during their hospitalization.Conclusions: The majority of patients undergoing court-ordered detention for TB treatment (95%) successfully completed therapy. Likelihood of detention was most strongly associated with factors expected to be associated with poor adherence, including mental illness and substance abuse.

AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to examine the progress of the Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC) over the first five years of its existence toward stated goals while existing outside the constitutional framework of health care funding. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is a review of the outputs of the MHCC with emphasis on its first-ever mental health strategy for Canada, knowledge exchange network, anti-stigma initiatives, randomized controlled trial of housing-first initiatives for the homeless mentally ill, as well as other completed projects. Findings – Consultation and collaboration are essential aspects of working successfully with people with lived experience of mental illness, their families, health professionals, and governments. At the same time, when expectations are high, needs are great, and opinions are varied, disappointment and frustration are inevitable. Research limitations/implications – Although the MHCC initiatives include the largest single funded research project in mental health in Canadian history, and evaluation is built into other initiatives, the political dimension of its work does not lend itself to research evaluation. Practical implications – The creation of an organization outside the constitutional framework of health care funding may allow for a catalytic role in precipitating change. Social implications – The emphasis on anti-stigma campaigns targeted at defined populations (youth, health professionals, workforce, journalists) may combat the discrimination people with mental illnesses and their families experience. Originality/value – The paper shows that the Canadian experience is, to date, largely undescribed in the peer-reviewed literature and may influence other jurisdictions. One of its interventions is already being replicated internationally.

AB  - Background: A number of options for treatment are available to young drug users, but little is known about the youth who actually attempt to access such services. Here we identify characteristics of a cohort of street-involved youth and highlight commonly encountered barriers.Methods: From September 2005 to July 2007, data were collected from the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), a prospective cohort of 529 drug users aged 14-26 living in Vancouver, Canada. Participants who attempted to access any addiction services in the 6 months prior to enrollment were compared in univariate analyses and multiple logistic regression modeling of socio-demographic and drug-related factors.Results: Factors positively associated with attempting to access services included Aboriginal ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.66 [1.05-2.62]), high school education (AOR=1.66 [1.09-2.55]), mental illness (AOR=2.25 [1.50-3.38]), non-injection crack use (AOR=2.93 [1.76-4.89]), and spending >$50 on drugs per day (AOR=2.13 [1.41-3.22]). Among those who experienced difficulty-accessing services, the most commonly identified barrier was excessively long waiting lists. In a subgroup analysis comparing those who tried to access services but were unsuccessful to those who were successful, risk factors positively associated with failure included drug bingeing (odds ratio [OR]=2.86 [1.22-6.76]) and homelessness (OR=3.86 [1.11-13.4]).Conclusions: In light of accumulating evidence that drug use among street youth is associated with risky health-related behaviors, improving access to treatment and other addiction services should remain an important public health priority.

AB  - Background: As medical homes are developing under health reform, little is known regarding depression services need and use by diverse safety-net populations in under-resourced communities. For chronic conditions like depression, primary care services may face new opportunities to partner with diverse community service providers, such as those in social service and substance abuse centers, to support a collaborative care model of treating depression.Objective: To understand the distribution of need and current burden of services for depression in under-resourced, diverse communities in Los Angeles.Design: Baseline phase of a participatory trial to improve depression services with data from client screening and follow-up surveys.Participants: Of 4,440 clients screened from 93 programs (primary care, mental health, substance abuse, homeless, social and other community services) in 50 agencies, 1,322 were depressed according to an eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) and gave contact information; 1,246 enrolled and 981 completed surveys. Ninety-three programs, including 17 primary care/public health, 18 mental health, 20 substance abuse, ten homeless services, and 28 social/other community services, participated.Main Measures: Comparisons by setting in 6-month retrospective recall of depression services use.Key Results: Depression prevalence ranged from 51.9 % in mental health to 17.2 % in social-community programs. Depressed clients used two settings on average to receive depression services; 82 % used any setting. More clients preferred counseling over medication for depression treatment.Conclusions: Need for depression care was high, and a broad range of agencies provide depression care. Although most participants had contact with primary care, most depression services occurred outside of primary care settings, emphasizing the need to coordinate and support the quality of community-based services across diverse community settings.

AB  - PURPOSE: To increase the number of high-risk and homeless youth who receive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test results and posttest counseling. METHODS: Oral HIV testing and counseling were offered to high-risk and homeless youth at sites at which youth congregate throughout Portland, Oregon. Subjects were randomized to receive test results and posttest counseling either in a face-to-face manner or with the option of telephone notification. Self-reported demographic and risk-behavior information was collected prior to HIV testing. The differences in the proportion of youth who received their test results were analyzed according to the notification method and demographic characteristics using SPSS. RESULTS: Among the 351 youth who were tested, 48% followed up to receive test results and posttest counseling. Adolescents most likely to receive their results were female, older (19-24 years), and white and those who reported high-risk behaviors. Those given the option of telephone notification were significantly more likely to receive their results than those required to have face-to-face notification (odds ratio = 2.301, 95% confidence interval of 1.499, 3.534). This was true regardless of age, race, history of previous HIV testing, or presence of high-risk behaviors. Two youths tested positive for HIV corroborating previous reports of low HIV prevalence in this population. Both were assigned to the face-to-face notification group and, therefore, no HIV positive results were given by telephone. CONCLUSIONS: The option of telephone notification significantly increased the proportion of youth who received posttest counseling and results following community-based testing.

AB  - Adolescence is a developmental period during which many youth experiment with risk practices. This paper examined the association of parental monitoring with a range of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use behaviors among high-risk youth, while controlling for other demographic and environmental variables previously found to be associated with AOD use. Participants were recruited as part of a longitudinal evaluation study of four youth drop-in centers located in Southern California. These centers served at-risk youth, including Hispanic, Lesbian/ Gay/Bisexual/Questioning (LGBQ), and homeless and runaway youth. Participants were aged 14 to 24 and were new attendees at the drop-in centers. Results from logistic regression analyses revealed that while controlling for demographic and environmental variables, adolescents who reported less parental monitoring were more likely to report lifetime use of cigarettes, marijuana, and methamphetamine, and in the past three months, use of alcohol and binge drinking. The findings thus indicate that, even among high-risk youth, those who reported low parental monitoring were significantly more likely to use a variety of substances. Implications of these findings are discussed as they pertain to AOD prevention and interventions for children and their families.

AB  - Purpose: To explore differences and similarities in environmental, personal, and behavioral factors influencing eating behavior among low-income women of varying weight status.Design: Focus groups (n = 16) were used to collect qualitative data. Quantitative data collected included demographic, lifestyle, and anthropometric (heights and weights).Setting: Community centers, libraries, and homeless shelters in low-income neighborhoods.Participants: Of the 83 participants, 58% were African-American, 28% were white, and the remainder were American Indian, Hispanic, or mixed race. A total of 35% of participants were lean/normal (body mass index <25 kg/m(2)) and 65% were overweight/obese (body mass index >25 kg/m(2)).Method: Focus group methodology was used to collect data on 83 participants. Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) provided the theoretical basis. Transcripts were analyzed using the open-coding method and comments between lean/normal and overweight/obese women were systematically compared.Results: Focus group themes were food environment, aberrant eating behavior, health values, and beliefs. Differences in personal and behavioral factors were apparent between overweight/obese and lean/normal women, with the former group frequently discussing emotional eating, overeating, and stashing food, and the latter group communicating greater nutrition knowledge and describing regular physical activity. Both groups similarly expressed experiences with food insecurity and lived in low-income environments.Conclusion: For low-income women, personal and behavioral factors may modify the influence of their obesogenic food environment. Further research within the context of SCT should examine differences between lean/normal and overweight/obese women living in the same environment.

AB  - Women at high-risk for HIV acquisition often face challenges that hinder their retention in HIV prevention trials. These same challenges may contribute to missed clinical care visits among HIV-infected women. This article, informed by the Gelberg-Andersen Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, identifies factors associated with missed study visits and describes the multifaceted retention strategies used by study sites. HPTN 064 was a multisite, longitudinal HIV seroincidence study in 10 US communities. Eligible women were aged 18-44 years, resided in a census tract/zipcode with high poverty and HIV prevalence, and self-reported ≥1 personal or sex partner behavior related to HIV acquisition. Multivariate analyses of predisposing (e.g., substance use) and enabling (e.g., unmet health care needs) characteristics, and study attributes (i.e., recruitment venue, time of enrollment) identified factors associated with missed study visits. Retention strategies included: community engagement; interpersonal relationship building; reduction of external barriers; staff capacity building; and external tracing. Visit completion was 93% and 94% at 6 and 12 months. Unstable housing and later date of enrollment were associated with increased likelihood of missed study visits. Black race, recruitment from an outdoor venue, and financial responsibility for children were associated with greater likelihood of attendance. Multifaceted retention strategies may reduce missed study visits. Knowledge of factors associated with missed visits may help to focus efforts.

AB  - Women at high-risk for HIV acquisition often face challenges that hinder their retention in HIV prevention trials. These same challenges may contribute to missed clinical care visits among HIV-infected women. This article, informed by the Gelberg-Andersen Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, identifies factors associated with missed study visits and describes the multifaceted retention strategies used by study sites. HPTN 064 was a multisite, longitudinal HIV seroincidence study in 10 US communities. Eligible women were aged 18-44 years, resided in a census tract/zipcode with high poverty and HIV prevalence, and self-reported ≥1 personal or sex partner behavior related to HIV acquisition. Multivariate analyses of predisposing (e.g., substance use) and enabling (e.g., unmet health care needs) characteristics, and study attributes (i.e., recruitment venue, time of enrollment) identified factors associated with missed study visits. Retention strategies included: community engagement; interpersonal relationship building; reduction of external barriers; staff capacity building; and external tracing. Visit completion was 93% and 94% at 6 and 12 months. Unstable housing and later date of enrollment were associated with increased likelihood of missed study visits. Black race, recruitment from an outdoor venue, and financial responsibility for children were associated with greater likelihood of attendance. Multifaceted retention strategies may reduce missed study visits. Knowledge of factors associated with missed visits may help to focus efforts.

AB  - Food insecurity is a pressing public health concern in many developing countries. Despite widespread interest in the sociocultural determinants of food insecurity, little is known about whether youths living in food insecure households experience food insecurity. The buffering hypothesis reviewed here assumes that, to the extent possible, adult members of households will buffer younger household members from the ill effects of food insecurity. A variant of the buffering hypothesis argues that only certain members of the households will enjoy the benefits of buffering. We hypothesize that within the context of Ethiopia, where girls have historically experienced discrimination, buffering is preferentially aimed at boys, especially as the household experiences greater levels of food stress. These hypotheses are tested using data from a population-based study of 2084 adolescents living in southwestern Ethiopia. Results indicate that boys and girls were equally likely to be living in severely food insecure households. Despite no differences in their households' food insecurity status, girls were more likely than boys to report being food insecure themselves. This gender difference was the largest in severely food insecure households. This same pattern was observed when comparing male-female sibling pairs living in the same household. These results are among the first to show that household level measures of food insecurity predict adolescent experiences of food insecurity, and that in the Ethiopian socio-cultural context, the relationship between household level food insecurity and adolescent food insecurity varies by gender. We also show that adolescent food insecurity is strongly associated with measures of general health and well-being.

AB  - PURPOSES: To (a) describe reasons adolescents give for their homelessness, (b) explore relationships among resilience and selected risk and protective factors, (c) identify differences in risk and protective factors by gender and sexual orientation, and (d) determine best predictors of resilience. DESIGN: A descriptive and exploratory correlational design was used to collect and analyze data from a convenience sample of 59 homeless adolescents who sought health and social services from a community street-outreach project in central Texas in 1998. METHODS: A paper and pencil survey consisting of valid measures (Resilience Scale, UCLA-Revised Loneliness Scale, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Social Connectedness Scale, and Death-Related Attitude Schedule) was administered in a street-outreach setting. FINDINGS: Nearly half the sample (47%) reported a history of sexual abuse and 36% self-identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual in orientation. Over half (51%) were thrown out of their homes by their parents, 37% left home because their parents disapproved of their alcohol or drug use, and nearly one-third left home because parents sexually abused them. Lack of resilience was significantly related to hopelessness, loneliness, life-threatening behaviors, and connectedness, but not to gender or sexual orientation. Hopelessness and connectedness explained 50% of the variance in resilience. CONCLUSIONS: Participants who perceived themselves as resilient, although disconnected from other people, were less lonely, less hopeless, and engaged in fewer life-threatening behaviors than were those who perceived themselves as not being resilient. They survived by adapting to street life and by becoming overly self-reliant. Findings may be useful in planning interventions to promote health and well-being in this vulnerable population.

AB  - Introduction: School snack and breakfast programs may be especially important in remote northern communities where many households are food insecure. Despite the strong potential for school programs to improve the dietary intake and eating behaviours of children and youth, very few studies have reported on the effects of school nutrition programs in Aboriginal communities. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a school snack program on the dietary intake of grade six to ten First Nation students living in a remote community in northern Ontario. Methods: Data were collected in November 2004 and December 2007 with grade six to ten (aged 10-18 years) students (n=63 and n=50, respectively) using a validated web-based 24 hour diet recall survey, the WEB-Q. Food group consumption and nutrient intake of students participating in the school snack program on the previous day were compared with students who chose not to participate. In each year, ANOVA was used to assess differences between participants and non-participants, genders, and grade groups. The second data collection in December of 2007 included five questions asking students about their participation, preferences, and impressions of the snack program. Results: Students participating in the snack program during the 2004 data collection (37%; n=23) compared with those who did not (63%; n=40) had significantly (p<0.05) higher mean intakes from the 'Vegetables and Fruit' food group (7.5 vs 3.4 servings), folate (420 vs 270 µg), dietary fiber (18 vs 8 g), vitamin C (223 vs 94 mg), calcium (1055 vs 719 mg) and iron (16.5 vs 11.7 mg). For the 2007 data collection, snack program participants (52%; n=26) had higher intakes from the 'Milk and Alternatives' food group (3.3 vs 2.2 servings), vitamin A (697 vs 551 RE [retinol equivalents]), calcium (1186 vs 837 mg), and vitamin D (6.9 vs 4.4 µg) and significantly lower intakes of 'Other' foods (6.0 vs 7.2 servings) compared with non-participants (48%; n=24). For 2004 and 2007, differences in intake also occurred by gender and grade groupings, with no interaction effects between snack participation and gender or grade. With the exception of 'Meat and Alternatives' in 2004, there was a trend for a higher percentage of students to meet dietary recommendations if they participated in the snack program. Students indicated that the three things they liked most about the school snack program were the juice (50%), that the program kept them from feeling hungry at school (40%), and that they got a snack at school every day (32%). Students indicated that the snack program helped them to eat healthier by motivating them (74%), eating more fruit (86%), and making better dietary choices (68%). Conclusions: Given the positive impact of the program on the food and nutrient intake of school snack program participants, qualitative feedback will be used to enhance the program and participation. Clearly, school snack programs can be an important venue to address the nutritional vulnerability of First Nation youth living in remote communities.

AB  - PROBLEM. This study sought to measure the effects of a short-term parenting course for homeless parents to decrease their parenting stress and potential for abusive parenting behaviors. SAMPLE. Nineteen homeless parents lived in a family emergency shelter for homeless families in Hillsborough County, FL. Their average length of shelter stay was 3 weeks. METHODS. Residents were invited to participate in a parenting education course consisting of three 1-hour classes weekly for 3 consecutive weeks. Class content focused on the parent, the child, and discipline. Subjects' potential for child abuse was measured with the Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory and their parenting stress with the Parenting Stress Index. A quasi-experimental pre/posttest design was used, with a t test statistic at the .05 level of significance. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze selected demographic data. FINDINGS. Results revealed significant differences in the scores of parenting stress originating from the child domain of the PSI and in the scores on the construct of unrealistic expectations of the child in the AAPI. Both scores had decreased on the posttest. CONCLUSIONS. Short-term parenting education courses may be a useful intervention strategy.

AB  - This article addresses controversy over gender differences in risk and protective factors for late-adolescence assaults. A secondary analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort considered 2,552 youth aged 12 or 13 in the first survey wave. Comparison of girls and boys revealed, as expected, boys had higher levels of risk factors: early delinquency, gang involvement, and hopelessness. Girls were higher in the protective factors, parental monitoring, and school and religious ties; but boys were higher in parental support and work involvement. Negative binomial regression showed that gang exposure and hopelessness explained assaults, regardless of gender. For girls, early runaway behavior and work activity were positively, and parental monitoring was negatively, related to assaults. Unexpectedly, boys with high parental support were more assaultive than others. Prevention requires addressing negative contexts for all youth, but for girls, programs also must address conditions promoting their running away.

AB  - The literature on homeless adults with severe mental illness is generally silent on a critical issue surrounding service delivery--the contrast between housing first and treatment first program philosophies. This study draws on data from a longitudinal experiment contrasting a housing first program (which offers immediate permanent housing without requiring treatment compliance or abstinence) and treatment first (standard care) programs for 225 adults who were homeless with mental illness in New York City. After 48 months, results showed no significant group differences in alcohol and drug use. Treatment first participants were significantly more likely to use treatment services. These findings, in combination with previous reports of much higher rates of housing stability in the housing first group, show that 'dual diagnosed' adults can remain stably housed without increasing their substance use. Thus, housing first programs favoring immediate housing and consumer choice deserve consideration as a viable alternative to standard care.

AB  - In the United States, 17% of children and adolescents are overweight and 20% live in a food insecure household. Previous studies examining the association between household food insecurity and overweight among children have been inconclusive but are limited insofar as they did not assess child-specific measures of food insecurity and overweight. In response, this study examined the association between food insecurity and child overweight status when these variables were measured for the same child using information on children (n = 1031) aged 10-15 y from the Three-City Study. Approximately 8% of the children were food insecure, whereas 50% were either at risk of overweight or overweight. Bivariate analyses indicated that there were no significant differences in the prevalence of at risk of overweight and overweight between food secure and food insecure children. Gender, race, and income showed similar patterns. Results from logistic regression analyses also indicated that the likelihood of being overweight or at risk of overweight was not significantly different for food secure and food insecure children. Although child-specific food insecurity was not associated with overweight in this sample of low-income children, food insecurity and overweight coexist among these low-income children, because approximately 25% of the food insecure children were overweight. Additional research is needed to explore the potential relationships between food insecurity and overweight and to better inform policy that attempts to address these issues among low-income households with children.

AB  - Abstract: Purpose: Rates of depression among street youth are poorly characterized, particularly as they pertain to concurrent drug use. We sought to assess associations between drug type and degree of depression in this population. Methods: Between October 2005 and November 2007, data were collected from a cohort of street-recruited youth aged 14–26 residing in Vancouver, Canada, for the At-Risk Youth Study. Active drug users were classified by predominant substance of use: daily marijuana use, weekly cocaine/crack use, weekly crystal methamphetamine use, or weekly heroin use. Adjusted mean number of depressive symptoms (measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression [CES-D] scale) was compared among the four groups using multiple linear regression. Logistic regression was also used to assess adjusted odds of CES-D score ≥22. Results: Among 447 youth, mean CES-D score was the highest among heroin users (adjusted mean: 22.7; standard deviation [SD]:1.2), followed by crystal methamphetamine users (adjusted mean: 21.8; SD: 1.1), then cocaine and/or crack users (adjusted mean: 19.1; SD: 1.0), and finally, marijuana users (adjusted mean: 18.3; SD: 1.1), resulting in a difference that was significant among groups (p < .001). When compared with daily marijuana users, odds of CES-D score ≥22 were higher among heroin users (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.39–4.99) and crystal methamphetamine users (AOR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.04–3.42), but not among cocaine/crack users (AOR: 1.41; 95% CI: .79–2.52). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report of drug use typologies and depression among street youth. Policymakers might heed the apparent vulnerability of heroin and crystal methamphetamine users to even greater degrees of depression than their peers.

AB  - There has been considerable recent interest in the health and associated socio-economic inequalities faced by adults with learning disabilities. A serious and so far under-reported aspect of this is homelessness. This study sought to determine the prevalence of intellectual disability in a homeless population. Fifty people registered at a general practice in north-east England for socially excluded groups, and staying in temporary accommodation for the homeless during 2006-7, were assessed for learning disability. Full-scale and verbal IQ scores for the group were significantly lower than would be expected in the general population, but there was no significant difference in performance IQ. Homeless people are significantly more likely to have an intellectual disability than the general population. The implications for practice and policy development are far reaching. Further work is required to confirm these findings and to explore the experience of homeless people with intellectual disability.

AB  - Household food insecurity constrains food selection, but whether the dietary compromises associated with this problem heighten the risk of nutrient inadequacies is unclear. The objectives of this study were to examine the relationship between household food security status and adults' and children's dietary intakes and to estimate the prevalence of nutrient inadequacies among adults and children, differentiating by household food security status. We analyzed 24-h recall and household food security data for persons aged 1-70 y from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey (cycle 2.2). The relationship between adults' and children's nutrient and food intakes and household food security status was assessed using regression analysis. Estimates of the prevalence of inadequate nutrient intakes by food security status and age/sex group were calculated using probability assessment methods. Poorer dietary intakes were observed among adolescents and adults in food-insecure households and many of the differences by food security status persisted after accounting for potential confounders in multivariate analyses. Higher estimated prevalences of nutrient inadequacy were apparent among adolescents and adults in food-insecure households, with the differences most marked for protein, vitamin A, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B-6, folate, vitamin B-12, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc. Among children, few differences in dietary intakes by household food security status were apparent and there was little indication of nutrient inadequacy. This study indicates that for adults and, to some degree, adolescents, food insecurity is associated with inadequate nutrient intakes. These findings highlight the need for concerted public policy responses to ameliorate household food insecurity.

AB  - Background:Ending homelessness is a major priority of the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), and alcohol use can be a barrier to stable housing. Clinical trials suggest that depot extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) is efficacious in reducing alcohol consumption among alcohol-dependent subjects.Methods:An open-label, randomized pilot study sought to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of XR-NTX versus oral naltrexone to improve alcohol consumption and housing stability among homeless, alcohol-dependent veterans at the Providence Veteran Affairs Medical Center.Results:Of 215 potential candidates approached over a 16-month recruitment period, only 15 agreed to consider study entry and 7 were randomized. The primary reasons given for refusal were not wanting an injection; fear of needles; and not wanting to change drinking habits. Only 1 participant in the XR-NTX group returned after the first injection. Three participants in the oral naltrexone group attended all 7 visits and had good outcomes.Conclusions:Although XR-NTX has demonstrated efficacy in reducing heavy drinking, limited acceptance of the injection might reduce its effectiveness among homeless, alcohol-dependent patients.

AB  - Objectives: To examine differences in health risks, health outcomes and health services use of Calgary street-involved youth by level of street involvement to inform services planning.Method: 355 street-involved youth (61% male, 26% Aboriginal) completed surveys at a variety of outdoor and agency locations: 46% currently lived on the street, 33% had lived on the street in the past, and 20% were street-involved but had not lived on the street. Odds Ratios (OR) adjusted for sex, ethnocultural group, and age group were calculated for each health/health risk and health service factor by level of street involvement.Results: With the exception of condom use, significant health and health risk outcome differences were seen by level of street involvement. Use of hospitals and walk-in clinics did not differ significantly by level of street involvement; however, youth living on the street were less likely (OR 0.2) than those who had not lived on the street to use a physician during office hours, and those who had lived on the street were more likely (OR 10.1) to use mobile clinics, services that are targeted to street-involved people.Conclusion: Street-involved youth who had not lived on the street showed better health/health risk outcomes than those who currently or had lived on the street, and health services use showed some differences by level of street involvement. Public health and other service providers need to be cognizant of their role in providing prevention, safety or stabilization services for youth at different stages of street life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to describe the nature, extent, and reported perpetrators of violence against homeless women and to examine the psychosocial, behavioral, and environmental profiles of homeless women with and without a history of victimization and of their intimate male partners.DESIGN: Quasi-experimental, cross-sectional.SETTING: Los Angeles homeless shelters and streets.POPULATION: Five hundred and ten homeless women, residing in 36 homeless emergency and sober-living shelters or on the streets, along with their intimate sexual partners were invited to participate. The final sample consisted of 507 women. The mean of the ages reported by the homeless women was 35, with a mean of 11.1 years of education. Approximately 60% of the women were African American, 22% Latina, and 17% White.INTERVENTIONS: History of adult victimization was assessed with two items using a yes/no response format that asked women if they had been: (a) physically assaulted or attacked, not including sexual assault; or (b) sexually assaulted. Self-esteem was measured using a revised version of the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI). Psychological profile was measured with the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Drug and alcohol use was assessed with the Drug History Form. After consent was obtained, appointments were made for instrument administration to take place in a private room set aside by the director of the homeless shelter or a private place selected by women.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Thirty-nine percent of the women reported being physically and/or sexually assaulted as adults. About half the women in the study reported physical assault involving an intimate partner; the corresponding figure for rape was 20%. Of the homeless women victimized as adults, half reported childhood sexual abuse, and 42% experienced childhood physical abuse. Controlling for potential confounders, victimized women were more likely than others to have a history of childhood sexual and physical abuse, lifetime substance use, greater mental health symptomatology, and current risky sexual activity.RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study support the contention that homeless women are one of the most vulnerable segments of our society and are at high risk for a variety of health and social problems, including victimization. This suggests the need for intervention and screening programs by nurses and other health professionals that target homeless women. [CINAHL abstract]

AB  - This paper observes and compares discursive framings of new psychoactive substances (NPS) in parts of the mainstream media in Romania and the United Kingdom. It assembles a corpus of about 800 news items and looks into samples of reporting from 2009 to 2017. In Romania, NPS or more generally 'ethnobotanicals' were first associated with gullible youths experimenting with what appeared to be synthetic cannabinoids only for public attention to briefly move on to stimulant powders displacing heroin among injecting users, later on. In the UK, the synthetic cathinone mephedrone was presented by tabloids as a 'menace' to teenagers and other young users, only for synthetic cannabinoids to eventually be linked with rough sleepers and other vulnerable groups. Through this, qualitative distinctions are shown in the portraying of a middle-class notion of naïve but 'clean' youth, valuable in itself and the portraying of abject underclass users, mostly as a threatening and contagious presence. Beyond alarmism and exaggeration, drug news reporting thus also appears rooted in class politics and structural inequalities where NPS meet with the lived conditions and spoiled identities of disadvantaged groups.

AB  - This research examined the impact of including a supportive person on the outcomes of two culturally sensitive AIDS education programs, an education-only (traditional) program and a program combining education with self-esteem and coping enhancement (specialized). Research participants in this quasi-experimental study included 241 homeless women, who were randomly assigned by residence (drug treatment program or shelter) to one of four treatment groups. The outcomes measured at baseline, 6, and 12 months were risk behaviors, cognitive factors, and psychological functioning. Study results demonstrated significant improvements at both 6 and 12 months for the entire sample in all psychological, behavioral and cognitive outcome variables except active coping. Women in the specialized program improved more on AIDS knowledge and reduction in non-injection drug use than did those in the traditional program, but their active coping scores declined. Participation of a supportive person did not appear to have any effect on outcome.

AB  - The Surgeon General called dental caries the silent epidemic, suffered disproportionately by the poor. Homeless mothers/children are especially vulnerable as they lack access to dental care. This prospective study elucidated predictors of access, oral health, and the effectiveness of shelter-based care. A convenience sample of 120 homeless families (children n=236) provided predictor factors at intake and one month later. Nearly half the children (n=98) had dental caries. Ten independent variables explained 33% of the variance of access barriers; the most influential were mental health (B=-.426), oral health beliefs (B=.243), and victimization (B=.185). Ten independent variables explained 24.3% of the variance of oral health: mother's age (B=.351), number of children at the shelter (B=.337), and race (B=.154) had the most influence. Shelter-based care was effective in improving access: 43% of families secured dental appointments and perceived access barriers decreased after shelter-based care (t=4.695; p=<.001).

AB  - A qualitative study was conducted using focus group methodology to obtain the knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, programmatic suggestions as well as communication strategies for HIV prevention from four specific types of high-risk youth: incarcerated/detained youth, homeless/runaway youth, school aged youth, and alcohol and other drug using youth (in school). Eleven focus groups were conducted. No meaningful differences were found in issues across the four groups; however, there were differences with regard to gender. Youth provided specific suggestions for providing HIV prevention programs which include communication strategies. The results will be used to facilitate in the development and implementation of appropriate HIV prevention measures in eight counties of a predominantly rural southeastern state.

AB  - Description: After HIV diagnosis, timely entry into HIV medical care and retention in that care are essential to the provision of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Adherence to ART is among the key determinants of successful HIV treatment outcome and is essential to minimize the emergence of drug resistance. The International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care convened a panel to develop evidence-based recommendations to optimize entry into and retention in care and ART adherence for people with HIV.Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted to produce an evidence base restricted to randomized, controlled trials and observational studies with comparators that had at least 1 measured biological or behavioral end point. A total of 325 studies met the criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted and coded data from each study using a standardized data extraction form. Panel members drafted recommendations based on the body of evidence for each method or intervention and then graded the overall quality of the body of evidence and the strength for each recommendation.Recommendations: Recommendations are provided for monitoring entry into and retention in care, interventions to improve entry and retention, and monitoring of and interventions to improve ART adherence. Recommendations cover ART strategies, adherence tools, education and counseling, and health system and service delivery interventions. In addition, they cover specific issues pertaining to pregnant women, incarcerated individuals, homeless and marginally housed individuals, and children and adolescents, as well as substance use and mental health disorders. Recommendations for future research in all areas are also provided.

AB  - Homelessness and HIV are significant social problems that exacerbate one another. While the literature contains a number of descriptive studies on the persons who struggle with these issues, there is a dearth of comparative studies to help social workers better understand the differences between individuals who are HIV-positive and homeless and those who are HIV-positive and domiciled. This study examined the differences in psychological distress, medical illness, care, insurance, and social service acquisition and the impact on service delivery that these differences imply. This study employed a correlational design to examine a sample of 528 HIV-positive persons, 193 homeless and 335 domiciled, who had self-enrolled into care at an HIV-focused mental health clinic. The findings suggest that there are more similarities between homeless and non-homeless HIV-positive persons than were expected. HIV-positive homeless persons were also more likely to access social services such as transportation, housing, and substance abuse treatment. The implications for social workers involved in treatment planning and service delivery are discussed.

AB  - Using data from the National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients (NSHAPC) and an application of Felson's Routine Activities Theory, this paper examines gender and age differences in victimization experiences of a sample of more than 4,200 homeless and near-homeless people, mostly adults. Results suggest that there are no differences in victimization experience by homelessness status and that the negative relationship between age and victimization rates found in the general population is also found in the homeless population. However, the relationship is relatively weak and erratic, suggesting that homeless older adults who are at least 50 years old are at increased risk of becoming victims, a finding consistent with Routine Activities Theory. In addition, similar to research with other populations, younger homeless males are statistically more likely to report being victims of theft and physical assault while females of all ages are more likely to report being victims of sexual assault. However, for older homeless adults, the gender difference in likelihood of victimization disappears. Perhaps because older homeless women are labeled as easy targets, they were equally as likely as men to be victims of physical assault and theft in old age. This is also consistent with Routine Activities Theory.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess predictors of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) completion by using structural equation modeling (SEM) among homeless adults, a group at great risk for LTBI and active tuberculosis (TB). LTBI therapy is effective in stemming the progression to active TB, yet treatment adherence among homeless persons is difficult to attain. DESIGN: By using SEM, the authors assessed predictors of LTBI completion among a sample of 494 homeless adults in Los Angeles, CA, who received either a nurse case-managed program (NCM) or a usual care program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Latent variables were created with the baseline variables of site type, age, intervention status, dissatisfaction with health care, depression, TB risk assessment, alcohol use, heroin or cocaine use, and TB knowledge. Outcome variables included many of the same baseline variables as well as treatment completion. RESULTS: LTBI treatment completion (100% adherence) was significantly and positively associated with participation in NCM, older age, and less heroin or cocaine use. NCM also predicted greater TB knowledge, greater ease of treatment, and more satisfaction with treatment (NCM completion rate = 64%, control rate = 42%). CONCLUSION: The culturally competent NCM program, combined with active tracking and incentives, was successful in a difficult-to-treat and highly transient population.

AB  - Background: HIV prevention intervention efficacy is often assessed in the short term. Thus, we conducted a long-term (mean 4.4 years) follow-up of a woman-focused HIV intervention for African American crack smokers, for which we had previously observed beneficial short-term gains.Methods: 455 out-of-treatment African American women in central North Carolina participated in a randomized field experiment and were followed up to determine sustainability of intervention effects across three conditions: the woman-focused intervention, a modified NIDA intervention, and a delayed-treatment control condition. We compared these groups in terms of HIV risk behavior at short-term follow-up (STFU; 3-6 months) and long-term follow-up (LTFU; average 4 years).Results: The analyses revealed two distinct groups at STFU: women who either eliminated or greatly reduced their risk behaviors (low-risk class) and women who retained high levels of risk across multiple risk domains (high-risk class). At STFU, women in the woman-focused intervention were more likely to be in the low HIV risk group than the women in control conditions, but this effect was not statistically significant at LTFU. However, low-risk participants at STFU were less likely to be retained at LTFU, and this retention rate was lowest among women in the woman-focused intervention.Conclusions: Short-term intervention effects were not observed over 4 years later, possibly due to differential retention across conditions. The retention of the highest risk women presents an opportunity to extend intervention effects through booster sessions for these women.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study identified risk factors for homelessness among indigent urban adults without dependent children and with no history of psychotic illness. METHODS: We conducted a matched case-control study, stratified by sex, of 200 newly homeless men and women and 200 indigent men and women with no history of homelessness. Newly homeless case subjects were recruited from shelter assessment centers in New York City. Never-homeless control subjects, selected from public assistance centers, were single adults applying for home relief. Control subjects were matched with case subjects according to ethnicity, age, and sex. Trained interviewers employed standardized research instruments to probe 3 domains of risk factors: symptom severity and substance use disorder, family support and functioning, and prior use of services. RESULTS: Significant interaction effects by sex were present for symptom severity, heroin use disorder, and prior service use. Greater numbers of the homeless of both sexes lacked a high school diploma and had less income from all sources, including from their families, than of the never homeless. CONCLUSIONS: Newly homeless men and women with no history of psychotic illness differed from their never-homeless counterparts in the 3 domains investigated, but socioeconomic factors were also important.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to establish whether theoretically based personal (self-esteem), cognitive (AIDS knowledge), behavioral (coping), psychological well-being and distress (hostility, depression, and anxiety), and social (social support) characteristics vary by current, past, and never used drug and alcohol history. DESIGN: Convenience sample. SETTING: Appointments were made with women residing in homeless shelters; instrument administration took place in a private area. POPULATION: A sample of 1,013 homeless women residing in homeless shelters in Los Angeles or obtained through street outreach participated in the study. The homeless women were: (a) African American, Latina, or White; and (b) aged 18-50. A majority of women reported a history of drug use, alcohol use, or both (88%) and mental health problems (52%). INTERVENTIONS: Self-esteem was measured using a revised version of the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI). Social support was measured by 5 items from a modified scale developed by Sherbourne and Stewart in the Medical Outcomes Study. These items measure perceived availability of five dimensions of functional support, including (a) someone to have a good time with; (b) someone who provides food or a place to stay; (c) someone who listens to you talk about yourself or your problems; (d) someone to accompany you to an appointment to provide moral support; and (e) someone to show that they love or care for you. Coping was assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study Modes of Coping Battery. AIDS knowledge was measured by a 21-item subset of AIDS knowledge questions taken from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Health Interview supplement survey. Psychological well-being was measured by the Mental Health Index (MHI-5). Other instruments used included the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the Drug History Form. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Women who currently used drugs had fewer personal resources, as noted in their lower self-esteem and psychological well-being. Also, they had a higher incidence of depression, anxiety, and hostility. In comparison, past drug users had greater psychological well-being, however, not to the extent of women who never used them. As support networks of current users often encourage continuation of substance use, these findings suggest the tremendous adjustments that are likely to occur in a homeless woman's social world if she decides to stop using drugs, alcohol, or both, and must renegotiate a new system of support. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Supportive interventions are critical for women who are past users in order to facilitate maintenance of sobriety and to reinforce the positive health outcomes they have experienced since quitting drugs and alcohol. A number of limitations must be noted in this study, including the convenience sample and the lower than desired Cronbach alpha for emotion-focused coping. Future research will expand on these findings by tracing the causal paths related to these factors in a multidimensional model of the substance misuse problem among homeless women. [CINAHL abstract]

AB  - This study examined the effects of integrating mental health, substance abuse, and housing interventions for homeless persons with co-occurring severe mental illness and substance use disorder. With the use of a quasi-experimental design, integrated treatment was compared with standard treatment for 217 homeless, dually diagnosed adults over an 18-month period. The integrated treatment group had fewer institutional days and more days in stable housing, made more progress toward recovery from substance abuse, and showed greater improvement of alcohol use disorders than the standard treatment group. Abuse of drugs other than alcohol (primarily cocaine) improved similarly for both groups. Secondary outcomes, such as psychiatric symptoms, functional status, and quality of life, also improved for both groups, with minimal group differences favoring integrated treatment.

AB  - Patterns of comorbidity between depressive symptoms and substance use were examined simultaneously in community and clinical-based samples of 5268 Costa Rican adolescents, ages 12-20, through a series of descriptive, ANCOVA and logistic regression analyses. Groups surveyed included high school students, street youth, and youth in treatment for substance abuse problems. Results revealed significant group differences in substance use and significant correlations between depressive symptoms and problems with alcohol and drugs. The association between depressive symptoms and overall substance use involvement was significant for all youth, but strongest for female street youth. Logistic regression analyses revealed that depressive symptoms were associated with increased odds of specific substance use for all three groups, though in the case of street youth and youth in treatment, these associations only were observed in males. Analyses of covariance indicated that problems with drugs and alcohol differed across group and sex. Youth in treatment had more problems with drugs and alcohol than other groups. Among street youth, males had more problems with drugs than females. This study provides a unique cross-cultural perspective on the comorbidity of depression and substance use among youth, and allows for comparative analyses between community and clinical-based participants.

AB  - This article explores the conflict management styles of homeless male street youth and young males from the general population. Findings indicate that street youths are more likely to demand reparation from people they perceive have harmed them and are more willing to use aggression to settle disputes. They also hold subcultural values that leave them more likely to become upset and use aggression in disputes. These youth are less influenced by conflict intensity when compared to males from the general population and are more sensitive to attacks by equals. In contrast, the behavior of young males from the general population is not predicted by cultural values that support violence. Instead, males from the general population require intense conflict before they become upset, demand reparation, and use aggression to settle disputes. Findings are discussed in terms of the expectations that actors in different structural locations bring to social interactions.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization, half of the 14 million people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide were infected between the ages of 15 and 24 years. However, details about HIV-positive (HIV+) youths' risk-related behavior and social context have not been previously reported. OBJECTIVES. To outline detailed sexual and drug use practices, social and psychological status of HIV+ youth compared with a cohort of HIV-negative (HIV-) youth; and to examine the ability of the health belief and risk-taking models to predict sexual and drug use acts of HIV+ youth. METHODS. HIV testing was conducted on and a 207-item structured interview covering HIV risk-related acts, protective factors and background information was administered to 72 HIV+ and 1142 HIV- adolescents aged 13 through 21 years receiving care in an adolescent clinical care unit of a large medical center in New York City. Data were analyzed for adolescents reporting sexual intercourse (71 HIV+ and 722 HIV-) by logistic regression analysis of five domains to identify variables significantly associated with HIV seropositivity. RESULTS. Logistic regressions indicated significant differences in sexual risk acts based on serostatus and gender. Anonymous, blinded seroprevalence testing identified 11% more HIV+ adolescents than would have been identified by current counseling and testing practices. HIV+ adolescents were significantly more likely to be sexually abused (33 vs 21%, P < .05), engage in anal sex and survival sex (32 vs 4%, P < .01), unprotected sex with casual partners (42 vs 23%, P < .05), have had sex under the influence of drugs (52 vs 27%, P < .01), have a sexually transmitted disease (59 vs 28%, P < .01), use multiple drugs (43 vs 9%, P < .01) and engage in multiple problem behaviors (72 vs 30%, P < .01) than HIV- young people. HIV+ females reported more oral (69 vs 45%, P < .01) and/or anal (42 vs 12%, P < .01) intercourse compared to HIV- females. HIV+ males reported significantly higher rates of both insertive (82 vs 46%, P < .05) and receptive (51 vs 4%, P < .01) oral and anal (53 vs 13%, P < .01) intercourse than HIV- males. Protective factors were not significantly different for HIV+ and HIV- young people. CONCLUSIONS. Routine, confidential HIV counseling and testing should be considered for adolescents having unprotected sexual intercourse when age-specific services are available for HIV+ youth. Prevention programs should consider adolescents' history of abuse, homelessness, and other social as well as psychological dimensions in designing comprehensive care strategies to address HIV+ adolescents' multiple problem behaviors and living situations. Current theoretical models of health behaviors should be reconsidered, given the lack of their association to HIV risk acts of HIV+ youth. Age-specific services and interventions for HIV+ youth are urgently needed as HIV is spreading among youth worldwide.

AB  - Supportive housing, defined as subsidized housing in conjunction with site-based social services, may help improve the health and residential stability of highly disadvantaged individuals. This study examined changes in health status, quality of life, substance use, health care utilization, and residential stability among 112 homeless and vulnerably housed individuals who applied to a supportive housing program in Toronto, Canada, from December 2005 to June 2007. Follow-up interviews were conducted every 6 months for 18 months. Comparisons were made between individuals who were accepted into the program (intervention) and those who were wait-listed (usual care) using repeated-measures analyses. Individuals who were accepted into the housing program experienced significantly greater improvements in satisfaction with living situation compared with individuals in the usual care group (time, F(3,3,261) = 47.68, p < 0.01; group × time, F(3,3,261) = 14.60, p < 0.01). There were no significant differences in other quality of life measures, health status, health care utilization, or substance use between the two groups over time. Significant improvement in residential stability occurred over time, independent of assigned housing group (time, F(3,3,261) = 9.96, p < 0.01; group × time, F(3,3,261) = 1.74, p = 0.17). The ability to examine the effects of supportive housing on homeless individuals was limited by the small number of participants who were literally homeless at baseline and by the large number of participants who gained stable housing during the study period regardless of their assigned housing status. Nonetheless, this study shows that highly disadvantaged individuals with a high prevalence of poor physical and mental health and substance use can achieve stable housing.

AB  - Research on street children has typically described the phenomenon and examined the risks of street life to healthy development. Thus far, research has not contextualized street children's psychosocial lives by comparing them with non-street children or street children undergoing rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to assess how the life priorities of Tanzanian street children, former street children and school-going children (n = 183) differ according to their living environment. The “Importance scale” was designed and validated for this study. It includes 29 four-level Likert items about relationships, activities and family, encompassing two subscales: current well-being (Cronbach's α = 0.65) and preparing for the future (Cronbach's α = 0.72). Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and contingency tables to determine group-level differences. Post-hoc Bonferroni tests determined pairwise differences. The analyses demonstrate significant differences in 14 of 29 priorities according to living context. With only three differences, former street children were more similar to school-going children than they were to street children. Street children and school-going children differed on 12 items, while street children and former street children differed on nine items. Street children considered that obtaining good advice from adults, having a dependable place to sleep and having time for enjoyable activities are most important, while former street children and school-going children pointed to education-related ambitions as most important. Findings show that after just 1 year of rehabilitative care, former street children's priorities are more similar to school-going children's, and thus rehabilitative care may be instrumental in enabling children to prioritize preparing for the future. Street children's emphasis on a safe place to sleep and adult support may reflect unmet basic needs. Former street children's high priorities on education and protecting themselves may represent healthy adaptation and a hopeful orientation to the future. High-quality rehabilitation for homeless youth can fulfill essential needs that may promote positive shifts in street children's priorities.

AB  - Access to sufficient food-in terms of both quality and quantity-is especially critical for children. Undernourishment during childhood and adolescence can have health implications, both short and long term. The prevalence of food insecurity was assessed in a sample of Vermont school children, as well as the relationship between food insecurity, participation in school breakfast or lunch, exercise and body mass index (BMI), all with a goal to identify needs to improve effectiveness of current programs. A cross-sectional, 23-item self-administered survey of students attending a public middle school in Vermont. Twenty percent of the children were residing in a food insecure household. No statistically significant differences were observed in terms of age, sex or BMI percentile and food security status. Food insecure (with or without hunger) participants were less likely to eat breakfast at home compared to food secure participants (67.1% vs 81.4%, p = .007). However, such differences were not observed between eating school breakfast or lunch. Sixty-two percent of food insecure (with or without hunger) participants engaged in daily exercise compared to 75.9% food secure participants (p = .014). Children in food insecure households were less likely to be physically active and to eat breakfast at home. However, the school breakfast program is negating any difference between the 2 groups in terms of eating breakfast at all. We consider this a success given the short- and long-term implications of food insecurity in children. We believe these findings have important implications for schools, policy makers, and programs to reduce food insecurity.

AB  - PURPOSE. To describe homeless parents' perceptions of parenting stress as potential indicators of needs for support in parenting roles. SAMPLE. Forty-seven homeless parents (30 mothers, 17 fathers). METHODS. Subjects completed the Parenting Stress Index to measure perceived parenting stress in the areas of child domain, parent domain, and life stress. FINDINGS. Homeless mothers and homeless fathers both identified the child domain as the most frequent source of stress. T tests showed a significant difference between groups only in the parent domain subscale of competence. CONCLUSIONS. Findings from this study indicate the need to include parenting stress questions in an initial nursing or health assessment.

AB  - HIV risk characteristics and sources of HIV information were examined in a sample of 430 sexually active street youth recruited in Seattle, Washington. Overall, 40% of these youth were living on the street or in a shelter at time of interview. The majority (80%) reported having multiple sex partners in the prior 30 days. Condom use was reported more frequently for non-main partners versus main partners. More than one-third had ever injected drugs and almost all reported use of alcohol or other substances. Basic HIV knowledge and recent exposure to HIV information were relatively high-63% of street youth had received HIV information from two or more sources in the prior 3 months. Small media (e.g. brochures, flyers) were the most frequently-mentioned channel of HIV information (77%), followed by interpersonal (60%), and mass media sources (41%). HIV information from street-based small media had been received by 63% of the sample, and were the only specific source of HIV information to reach more than half of street youth. Significant differences in sources of HIV information were observed for gender and homeless status. Recent exposure to HIV information via small media channels was positively associated with several psychosocial variables pertaining to condom-use with the respondent's main sex partner, while exposure to any source was not related to variables associated with condom use with non-main partners. Implications of these findings for prevention communication campaigns targeting street youth are discussed.

AB  - Suppurative methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin infections are common and associated with MRSA colonization, but little is known about non-suppurative cellulitis and its relationship with MRSA colonization in areas endemic for community-associated MRSA. We prospectively enrolled patients hospitalized for non-suppurative cellulitis (n=50) and matched controls (n=100) and found S. aureus colonization was similar in cases and controls (30% vs. 25%, P=0·95). MRSA was uncommon in cases (6%) and controls (3%) (P=0·39). All MRSA isolates were USA300 by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Independent risk factors for non-suppurative cellulitis were diabetes (OR 3·5, 95% CI 1·4-8·9, P=0·01) and homelessness in the previous year (OR 6·4, 95% CI 1·9-20·9, P=0·002). These findings suggest that MRSA may only rarely be causative of non-suppurative cellulitis.

AB  - Background: Small-scale poultry production has the potential to increase animal-source food consumption, improve household income, and reduce food insecurity.Objective: To assess the impact of a chicken Newcastle disease vaccination program on consumption of chicken and eggs among women and children, income, and food insecurity in rural Tanzanian households.Methods: Comparisons were made between households from three project villages, which participated in a Newcastle disease vaccination program for chickens, and three control villages, which did not participate. Household interviews were done with mothers from a random sample in March 2008 (237 households) and March 2009 (261 households).Results: After the first year of vaccinations (three rounds), project households kept significantly more chickens and tended to be more food secure than control households. Mothers from project households ate significantly more eggs than their counterparts in control households. A similar trend was observed among children. In 2009, fewer chickens were vaccinated in the project villages than in 2008, and more chickens were independently vaccinated in the control villages. This corresponded with an increase in ownership of chickens, a reduction in food insecurity, and improved consumption of eggs in control villages, whereas chicken ownership and egg consumption decreased and food insecurity remained relatively stable in project villages. We saw no differences between project and control villages in income earned from chicken and egg sales.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that an increase in chicken Newcastle disease vaccination can lead to an increase in ownership of chickens and egg consumption and may also have an effect on reducing household food insecurity.

AB  - Food insecurity is a pervasive public health problem in high income countries, disproportionately affecting households with children. Though it has been strongly linked with socioeconomic status and investments in social protection programs, less is known about its sensitivity to specific policy interventions, particularly among families. We implemented a difference-in-difference (DID) design to assess whether Canadian households with children experienced reductions in food insecurity compared to those without following the roll-out of a new country-wide income transfer program: the Canada Child Benefit (CCB). Data were derived from the 2015-2018 cycles of Canadian Community Health Survey. We used multinomial logistic regressions to test the association between CCB and food insecurity among three samples: households reporting any income (N = 41,455), the median income or less (N = 18,191) and the Low Income Measure (LIM) or less (N = 7579). The prevalence and severity of food insecurity increased with economic vulnerability, and were both consistently higher among households with children. However, they also experienced significantly greater drops in the likelihood of experiencing severe food insecurity following CCB; most dramatically among those reporting the LIM or less (DID: -4.7%, 95% CI: -8.6, -0.7). These results suggest that CCB disproportionately benefited families most susceptible to food insecurity. Furthermore, our findings also indicate that food insecurity may be impacted by even modest changes to economic circumstance, speaking to the potential of income transfers to help people meet their basic needs.

AB  - Abstract: This study examines the impact of early abuse on the functioning and the 12-month treatment outcomes of 146 homeless addicted women who entered residential substance abuse treatment. Sixty-nine percent of the women reported exposure to childhood physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; the majority reported multiple forms of abuse. Comparisons of abused and nonabused women revealed significant differences in childhood, adolescent, and adult functioning, indicative of the pervasive detrimental effects of early abuse. Female survivors of childhood abuse did not improve in treatment as much as their nonabused peers in psychological functioning (p < .001), substance abuse (p < .01), or continuing trauma exposure (p < .01) .The findings suggest the importance of adapting models of residential substance abuse treatment to address concurrent issues related to trauma history. Additional research is needed to identify effective integrated treatment approaches for this population and to explore the independent and interconnected pathways linking trauma history and outcome.

AB  - Background: Little information is available to guide researchers who must estimate the costs associated with obtaining postintervention survey data from research cohorts.Objective: To estimate the costs of following girls involved in the juvenile justice system who were part of a reproductive health promotion intervention for 6 months; to determine the costs of collecting follow-up data; and to determine how participant characteristics, recruitment sites, and follow-up methods affect costs.Method: Direct and indirect costs associated with program staff and various support services' time and the costs of incentives for participation were used to calculate the total cost of follow-up for each participant. Associations between the participant and program characteristics and total costs were assessed using bivariate and multivariate tests.Results: Of the 449 participants, 402 (89.5%) completed 6-month follow-up. Participants who had been or were pregnant, were runaways, had a history of partner violence, or did not use birth control at baseline were less likely to complete follow-up data. An average of 5.8 attempts was made over an average of 2.97 hr to locate each participant. The average cost of follow-up was $101.82 per participant. Locating participants using family members had the smallest impact on cost, whereas working with parole officers had the largest impact on cost.Discussion: These findings have implications for researchers preparing budgets for interventions that include a follow-up data collection. Greater resources should be allocated and specific strategies should be implemented when research cohorts have large numbers of participants with specific risk behaviors.

AB  - Objective: Reductions in runaways' sexual risk behaviors were evaluated in response to an intensive program to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).Design: In a nonrandomized control trial, sexual risk behaviors among 78 runaways at one residential shelter who received up to 30 HIV/AIDS intervention sessions were compared with 67 runaways at a nonintervention shelter with sexual behaviors assessed at baseline and 3 and 6 months.Setting: Runaways were recruited from the only two publicly funded shelters in New York, NY.Participants: The runaways were aged 11 to 18 years, 64% female, and predominantly black or Hispanic.Intervention: The intervention addressed general knowledge about HIV/AIDS, coping skills, access to health care and other resources, and individual barriers to safer sex.Main Outcome Measures: Consistent condom use, a high-risk pattern of sexual behavior, and sexual abstinence over a 3-month time frame were assessed.Main Results: As the number of intervention sessions increased, runaways' reports of consistent condom use increased significantly (at 3 months, unique R2 = .06, P less than .05; at 6 months, unique R2 = .09, P less than .05), and their reports of engaging in a high-risk pattern of sexual behavior decreased significantly (at 3 months, unique R2 = .03, P = .06; at 6 months, unique R2 = .04, P less than .05). Abstinence did not change.Conclusions: The demonstrated effectiveness of the intensive HIV/AIDS program highlights the importance of enlarging the scope of most current HIV/AIDS prevention programs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that adverse childhood experiences are risk factors for adult homelessness. METHODS: We interviewed a nationally representative sample of 92 US household members who had previously been homeless and a comparison group of 395 individuals with no prior homelessness. We assessed childhood adversity with a structured protocol that included a previously validated scale indicating lack of care from parents and single-item measures of physical and sexual abuse. RESULTS: Lack of care from a parent during childhood sharply increased the likelihood of subsequent homelessness (odds ratio [OR] = 13), as did physical abuse (OR = 16). Sexual abuse during childhood was associated with a nonsignificant trend toward homelessness (OR = 1.7). The risk of subsequent homelessness among individuals who experienced both lack of care and either type of abuse was dramatically increased compared with subjects reporting neither of these adversities (OR = 26). CONCLUSIONS: Adverse childhood experiences are powerful risk factors for adult homelessness. Effectively reducing child abuse and neglect may ultimately help prevent critical social problems including homelessness.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify risk and protective factors for family homelessness, a case-control study of homeless and low-income, never-homeless families, all female-headed, was conducted. METHODS: Homeless mothers (n = 220) were enrolled from family shelters in Worcester, Mass. Low-income housed mothers receiving welfare (n = 216) formed the comparison group. The women completed an interview covering socioeconomic, social support, victimization, mental health, substance use, and health domains. RESULTS: Childhood predictors of family homelessness included foster care placement and respondent's mother's use of drugs. Independent risk factors in adulthood included minority status, recent move to Worcester, recent eviction, interpersonal conflict, frequent alcohol or heroin use, and recent hospitalization for a mental health problem. Protective factors included being a primary tenant, receiving cash assistance or a housing subsidy, graduating from high school, and having a larger social network. CONCLUSIONS: Factors that compromise an individual's economic and social resources are associated with greater risk of losing one's home.

AB  - BACKGROUND:: National estimates of injury prevalence in the Emergency Department (ED) are based on medical record review and vary considerably. By using a more robust approach to surveillance, we (1) determine the prevalence of injury of any type in an urban ED population and (2) explore the association between violence-related injury and personal characteristics of injury victims. METHODS:: This cross-sectional study was performed at an urban level I trauma center from June to August, 2005. We prospectively screened 4,246 consecutive ED patients for injury during a randomized schedule of shifts totaling 336 hours. The ED record of each injured patient was reviewed to catalogue injury type and intent (International Classification of External Causes of Injury, Short Form) as well as to estimate injury severity (New Injury Severity Score). We interviewed noncritically injured, adult patients who provided consent to collect demographic (race, income, and education) and personal information (substance abuse, domestic violence, handgun ownership, and homelessness). We sought independent associations between these variables and violence-related injury in an exploratory analysis using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS:: Injury contributed to 1,036 of 4,246 ED visits (24.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 23.1-25.7%). Eleven percent of injured patients were admitted to the hospital and two patients died in the ED. The majority of patients (75%) suffered minor injury. Among the 434 injured patients consenting to interview, the prevalence of established injury risk factors, such as substance use or handgun ownership, varied by gender. The adjusted odds of violence-related injury among this subset of patients were increased for males (odds ratio [OR], 2.22; 95% CI, 1.17-4.23), patients with an annual income less than $5,000 (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.64-4.97), those reporting a history of domestic violence (OR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.43-5.07), and heavy alcohol users (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.01-3.19). CONCLUSION:: One in four ED visits to this urban, county hospital is due, at least in part, to injury. Patient characteristics associated with violence-related injury may generate hypotheses for further study.

AB  - CONTEXT: Palliative care is an essential element of HIV care throughout the disease trajectory, but there is a lack of information to guide clinical care at HIV diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aimed to identify and appraise the evidence of palliative care-related problems at HIV diagnosis. METHODS: The search strategy combined the term 'HIV' with seven key words derived from the World Health Organization definition of multidimensional palliative care, in a systematic search of four databases. Abstracts and papers were screened to identify those recording problems within six months of HIV diagnosis in adults. Sample descriptions, aims, methods, and prevalence findings were extracted from these papers into common tables. RESULTS: Of 5443 titles retrieved, 65 met the inclusion criteria and 34 were retained. Papers included 27 original studies and seven secondary analyses of patient's records, with great heterogeneity in design, sample definition, and outcome measures. Physical and psychological symptoms were highly prevalent (pain 11%-76%, weight loss 8%-89%, fever 32%-89%, diarrhea 6%-54%, anxiety 36%-95%, and depression 18%-47%). At HIV diagnosis, well-being was impaired, suicidal thoughts were frequent, and peace and calmness were reduced. Participants lacked emotional support and feared the reaction of their families. Practical problems included hunger, homelessness, reduced ability to work, and need for childcare. Studies had methodological failings such as the use of unvalidated tools and lack of clarity reporting results. CONCLUSION: People who have recently been diagnosed with HIV have multidimensional palliative care-related problems. HIV care and support services need to assess and manage problems using integrated palliative care, with referral for complex problems. Patient centeredness must be a principle of HIV clinical research.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We compared health and social needs by gender, age, and race/ ethnicity of people leaving New York City jails and assessed the implication of these differences for the development of jail reentry programs. METHODS: Surveys were completed with 1,946 individuals (536 men, 704 women, and 706 adolescent males) between 1997 and 2004. Structured questionnaires captured data on demographic, criminal justice, substance use, and health characteristics. Bivariate comparisons were performed to determine variations between men and women, men and male adolescents, and non-Latino black and Hispanic/Latino respondents. RESULTS: The majority of participants were black and Hispanic/Latino, reported high levels of substance use, had high rates of recidivism, and experienced difficult living circumstances. Compared with men, women were more likely to be homeless, use illicit drugs, report drug charges at index arrest, have health problems, and be parents. Adolescent males were more likely than men to rely on illegal activities for income and to have used marijuana and alcohol recently, and were less likely to report homelessness or health problems. Ethnic/racial differences between black and Hispanic/Latino respondents within gender and age groups were smaller than differences among these groups. CONCLUSIONS: Jails concentrate individuals with multifaceted health and social problems, providing opportunities to engage at-risk populations in comprehensive reentry programs. Gender, age, and ethnic/racial differences among incarcerated populations require that interventions be tailored to the specific needs of these different groups.

AB  - Bipolar spectrum disorders have traditionally been thought to be chronic in course. However, recent epidemiologic research suggests that there may be developmentally limited forms of bipolar disorder. Two large, nationally representative studies reveal a strikingly high prevalence of bipolar disorders in emerging adulthood (5.5%-6.2% among 18-24-year-olds) that appear to resolve substantially during the latter half of the 3rd decade of life (3.1%-3.4% among 25-29-year-olds). Although ascertainment bias due to early mortality, institutionalization, incarceration, and homelessness may account for some of this reduction, the prevalence distribution suggests a high incidence in late adolescence and emerging adulthood that appears to resolve spontaneously in most cases. There were very few differences across age groups in symptom endorsement and comorbid diagnoses, suggesting that 18-24-year-olds that meet criteria for bipolar diagnoses experience clinically significant impairment and associated consequences of the disorder. More fine-grained longitudinal research is needed to determine whether developmentally limited forms of bipolar disorder exist and, if so, what markers might distinguish these forms of the disorder from more chronic courses.

AB  - Children responsible for their own survival exist in all countries. Despite social and cultural differences between street youth in developing countries versus homeless youth in developed countries, the predictors and correlates of homelessness are similar among youth. The AIDS pandemic is inextricably linked to homelessness and is a particularly devastating threat to the welfare of the world's disenfranchised youth, as they are continually forced into multiple HIV-related high risk situations and behaviors. Specific recommendations regarding clinical care, prevention programs, research, and the implications for policy and legislative action are discussed in relation to reducing the incidences and impact of HIV. For the world's populations of street children the issue of globally providing AIDS education and prevention within the context of health care services is emphasized, particularly by the promotion and training of physicians and other health professionals in street-based care.

AB  - Many transitional age foster youth (TAFY) emancipate from the foster care system with little or no support or resources, experience higher rates of homelessness, unemployment and worse physical and mental health. However, factors related to health outcomes, readiness to transition and health services utilization (HSU) in TAFY and young adults without a history of foster care remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare health-related outcomes among TAFY and young adults without a history of foster care and determine the differences between transition readiness and HSU outcomes among TAFY. This was a cross-sectional, comparative study of 206 young adults (103 TAFY and 103 controls), ages 18 to 26 years, recruited from local foster youth centers in the Los Angeles area. Controls were matched for age, gender, and ethnicity from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) database. TAFY participants completed health interview questions from the CHIS and the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ). In addition, the TAFY group provided written responses to open-ended questions to assess preparations for independent living, future goals and aspirations. The TAFY group was 63% female, mean age 21 ï¿½ 2.6, African American (40%), 7 or more years in foster care (56%), 7 or more foster placements (35%), income of less than $5,000 per year (39%), living in unstable housing (40%), and having at least one child (38%). There was no statistical significance between TAFY and CHIS controls except for variables related to socioeconomic status such as income, housing and employment. Foster youth reported statistically significant higher Emergency Department (ED) services use and lower perceived health status compared to controls (41% vs 17%, p <.001; 56% vs. 83%, p <.001), respectively. Mean transition readiness scores were assessed using the TRAQ which rates transition readiness on a 1 to 5 scale, with higher numbers indicating better transition readiness. Higher mean TRAQ scores were found when TAFY were grouped according to having a primary care provider (PCP) or no PCP (3.1 vs 2.1, p < .001), receiving preventative health care or no preventative care (3.0 vs 2.1; p <.001), and having no lapse in health insurance coverage or no insurance (3.0 vs 2.3; p <.001) within the past 12 month. Three themes emerged in the open-ended questions were: 1) the need for support in the transition process, 2) desire for success or financial wealth, and 3) to be part of a family or have their own family. The findings from this study suggest that TAFY living in Los Angeles showed decreased transition readiness and self-perceived health, increased physical and mental health conditions and HSU related to ED use compared to youth without a history of foster care. Routine screening for depression and early referral to mental health care and assessment of transition readiness is warranted to identify youth that lack independent living skills. Future research is needed to assess independent living skills educational programs and its impact on perceived transition readiness, HSU and health outcomes in this high risk vulnerable population.

AB  - To estimate the prevalence of active pulmonary tuberculosis in a homeless population in London and to assess whether those with suspected disease could be integrated into the existing health care system for further follow up and treatment. Voluntary screening programme based on a questionnaire survey and chest x ray. SETTING AND CASES: Screening programmes were set up over the Christmas period in 1992 and 1993 at a shelter for the homeless in London. An offer of screening was made to all individuals who visited the centre and an interviewer administered questionnaire was completed on those who volunteered for the screening. Chest x rays were carried out, developed, and read on site. Individuals with chest x rays features suggestive of tuberculosis or other medical problems were referred to a hospital of their choice. RESULTS AND OUTCOME: In 1992 nearly 1600 people visited the centre, of whom 372 volunteered for the screening and 342 were x rayed. Nineteen of the 342 (5.6%) had radiological features suggestive of active tuberculosis. In 1993 around 2000 homeless people visited the centre, of whom 270 volunteered for the screening and 253 were x rayed. Eleven (4.3%) had features consistent with active tuberculosis on the basis of the chest x rays and clinical examination by a chest physician. Overall, of 595 people x rayed in the two surveys, 30 (5%) had changes suggestive of active tuberculosis. Further investigations confirmed nine (1.5%) with active pulmonary disease and eight with no active tuberculosis. In 13, the diagnosis was not determined as four declined further investigation and nine did not attend their hospital appointment. Tuberculosis among the homeless remains a cause for concern. Follow up and treatment present unique difficulties. Services for the homeless need to include mechanisms for timely diagnosis and monitored treatment. Control programmes designed for the needs of the homeless are required.

AB  - Objective: To compare characteristics of homeless and low-income housed mothers across economic, psychosocial, and physical health domains.Design: Case-control study.Setting: Community of Worcester, Mass.Participants: A cross-sectional sample of 220 sheltered homeless mothers and 216 low-income housed (never homeless) mothers receiving welfare.Main Outcome Measures: Income, housing, life events, social support, history of abuse and assault, and mental and physical health.Results: Comparison of homeless and housed mothers revealed some important similarities and differences. The proportion of homeless mothers with annual incomes of less than $7000 was 46% vs 17% for housed mothers (P<.O1). Homeless mothers experienced more residential instability than the housed mothers (3.8 moves vs 1.8 moves; P<.001) and had smaller support networks (P<.001). More homeless mothers reported severe physical and sexual assault over the lifespan than housed mothers (91.6% vs 81.1 %; P<.003). No significant differences were found between the groups in mental and physical health. However, the lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorders was overrepresented compared to the general female population. Both groups had lower physical functioning compared to the general population and a higher prevalence of chronic health conditions.Conclusions: Sheltered homeless mothers had fewer economic resources and social supports and higher cumulative rates of violent abuse and assault over their lifespans than their housed counterparts. However, both groups faced extreme adversity that compromised family well-being. Practitioners and social policymakers need to be cognizant of the multiple economic, psychosocial, and physical health needs of these mothers in providing treatment and developing program interventions.

AB  - Historically, insufficient resources and assistance have been provided to young people leaving state care. Care leavers have been found to experience significant health, social and educational deficits including homelessness, disproportionate involvement in juvenile crime and prostitution, poor social supports, and early parenthood. The U.S. and Australia share a roughly common political language and system and have often exchanged ideas, agendas, and policies for government. This paper finds that whilst there are some minor differences in the respective legislative frameworks and responses, the similarities are far greater. Both countries have failed to provide the range of in-care, transitional, and post-care supports and services required to ensure improved outcomes for care leavers.

AB  - Background: In January 2003, the Canadian federal government announced its support of the scientific evaluation of safer injecting facilities (SIFs) in Canada. As emerging evidence from Europe and Australia has demonstrated that SIFs contribute significantly to reductions in the injection of drugs in public areas, the objective of this paper is to examine the nature of public injecting in Ottawa and its implications for a prospective SIF in the city. Methods: Between October 2002 and January 2003, street-recruited active IDUs consented to personal interviews. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine factors related to public injecting. Content analysis was undertaken of responses to an open-ended question regarding reasons for injecting in public locations. Findings: Overall, 65% of 506 participants reported injecting in any public place in the previous six months. Homelessness was the strongest predictor of public injecting (adjusted odds ratio: 6.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.8-11.6). IDUs injecting in public locations were also significantly more likely to be males; to have initiated drug injecting at younger ages; to score higher on a severity of addiction scale; and to report sharing used needles, injecting most often with any opiate other than morphine, injecting with five or more different people in the previous six months, and trading sex with male clients. Receiving most income from welfare was protective. IDUs who injected predominantly in public places were in chronic need of a location offering privacy and safety, whereas casual public injectors tended to report injecting in public only when in immediate need of a drug fix. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the implementation of a SIF could help alleviate harms related to public injecting among IDUs in Ottawa by the provision of a clean, private, and safe place to inject, with access to sterile injection equipment and housing and addiction services.

AB  - Objective: To assess whether interview mode (telephone vs. in-person) affects the results of surveys that measure food security.Design: Responses given by households interviewed by telephone and in-person in recent US Current Population Survey Food Security Supplements (CPS-FSS) were compared. Statistical methods based on the Rasch measurement model were used to assess whether response patterns differed between the two interview modes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was then used to gauge the effect of interview mode on the measured household prevalence rates of food insecurity and very low food security while controlling for income, employment, household structure, and other household characteristics that affect food security.Results: Response patterns to the indicators that comprise the food security scale did not differ substantially between interview modes. Prevalence rates of food insecurity and very low food security estimated from the two interview modes differed by only small proportions after accounting for differences in the socio-economic characteristics of households.Conclusions: Findings suggest that effects of interview mode on food security measurement in the CPS-FSS are small, or at most modest. Prevalence estimates may be biased upwards somewhat for households interviewed in-person compared with those interviewed by telephone. The extent to which these results can be generalised may depend, to some extent, on survey characteristics other than interview mode, such as surveyor name recognition and respondents' trust and confidence in the surveyor.

AB  - Objective: Cross-sectional data indicate that a relationship between household food insecurity and overweight exists among women in the USA. Cross-sectional data cannot determine if food insecurity leads to overweight as some have hypothesised. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship of food insecurity with subsequent weight gain in women using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID).Design, Setting and Subjects: Panel data from the 1999 and 2001 PSID, a nationally representative sample of households, were analysed using multivariate regression procedures.Results: Average weight gain among all women (n = 5595) was 1.1 kg on average over the two years. There were no significant differences in the percentages of women who gained a clinically significant amount (2.3 kg) by food insecurity status. Overweight women who were on a weight-gain trajectory during the 2-year period gained less if they were food-insecure. This relationship was not observed among healthy-weight or obese women.Conclusions: Overall, food insecurity does not appear to be strongly associated with subsequent weight gain in women.

AB  - PURPOSE: Recent increases in Hmong girls referred to a Midwest hospital-based child advocacy center prompted this comparison of abuse experiences for Hmong extra-familial sexual abuse cases versus peers. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all girls, aged 10 to 14 years, with extra-familial sexual abuse 1998-2003 (n = 226). Fourteen percent of cases were Hmong (n = 32). Demographics, risk behaviors, abuse experiences, physical findings and legal outcomes were compared for Hmong (H) and Other (O) girls using chi-square. Multivariate logistic regressions explored differences in gynecologic findings and sexually transmitted disease (STD) results. RESULTS: Hmong girls were more likely to be runaways (90% H vs. 8% O), truant (97% H vs. 13% O), self-mutilating (38% H vs. 10% O), and suicidal (41% H vs. 21% O). Seventy-seven percent of Hmong reported gang rape, prostitution, or multiple assaults versus 16% Others; most had 5+ perpetrators (69% H vs. 2% O) and 5+ assaults (75% H vs. 24% O, both p < .001). Gynecologic findings were more prevalent among Hmong girls (63% H vs. 21% O). Controlling for penetration, number of partners/assaults, and acuity at examination, Hmong ethnicity predicted gynecologic findings (adjusted odds ration [AOR] = 6.57). Hmong girls were more likely to have a positive chlamydia screen (36% H vs. 4% O, p < .001), but only number of perpetrators was an independent predictor (AOR = 15.09). Most cases were prosecuted, but Hmong had higher prosecution rates (83% H vs. 57% O, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Hmong girl assault experiences were markedly more severe than peers. Health care providers need appropriate knowledge of Hmong culture to conduct forensic examinations. Abused Hmong girls need culturally sensitive, developmentally appropriate after-care that helps connect them back with families and school.

AB  - To determine if the American Academy of Pediatrics Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) guidelines require tailoring for different settings, the researchers used a mixed-method research design to review an ADHD quality improvement effort in community clinics and private offices in San Diego County. Clinically, no differences were noted in rates of ADHD in the two settings. Children in community clinics (58.3%) were more likely to report public insurance (p < .001), diverse ethnic backgrounds (p = .003), low household incomes (p < .001), single parent households (p = .009), and to screen positive for Oppositional Defiant Disorder/Conduct Disorder (p = .027). They were also more likely to have experienced socio-environmental stressors (p < .001) including foster care, homelessness, parental drug use, and domestic violence. No differences were noted by treatment received at 12 months post-evaluation by office type. Open-ended interviews with clinicians confirmed these findings and revealed a need for tailoring of implementation strategies to more closely fit the needs of children and families cared for in public sector settings.

AB  - Covenant House, a non-governmental, social action organization assisting homeless children in the United States is compared and contrasted with its Latin American counterpart organization, Casa Alianza, which services street-living and street-working children throughout Mexico and Central America. Although Covenant House and Casa Alianza share a common mission: to protect children and guarantee their rights through promoting social justice, clear differences in organizational structure, program philosophy, intervention techniques and client characteristics are evident ltural contexts within which both organizations are embedded reveals how surrounding macrofactors can influence and uniquely shape social action organizations in their efforts to develop and deliver systematic and indigenous responses to the homeless, street-children population throughout the Americas.

AB  - This report describes the development of measures of AIDS knowledge and beliefs about AIDS prevention for adolescents. Review of the literature, focus groups, pilot testing, and reviews by advisory councils assured that the process of developing the measures contributed to their validity. These measures were administered to three samples of adolescents at high risk for contracting AIDS: 43 runaway males, 43 runaway females, and 36 self-identified gay males. Both the knowledge and the beliefs instruments showed moderately high internal consistency and test-retest reliability and successfully avoided ceiling effects. Gay males demonstrated significantly greater knowledge of AIDS; however, there were few differences in beliefs among the groups. Knowledge of AIDS was significantly correlated with beliefs about AIDS prevention. The results suggest that these measures identify gaps in knowledge and beliefs among high-risk youth.

AB  - In 1989 through 1990, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1437 homeless adults in northern California (98% response rate). Prevalences of alcohol abuse, illegal drug use, and psychiatric hospitalization when adults first became homeless were 15% to 33% lower than prevalences following homelessness. The largest differences between the homeless and a comparison group of 3122 nonhomeless adults were for psychiatric hospitalization (odds ratios [ORs] of 4.6 for men and 5.9 for women) and alcohol abuse (ORs of 2.3 for men and 4.0 for women). However, when prehomeless prevalences of addictive and psychiatric disorders were compared with prevalences among the nonhomeless, absolute differences were no greater than 12%.

AB  - Research has shown that physical and sexual maltreatment precipitate runaway behavior in adolescents. However, there have been few large-scale examinations of the family, school, and personal problems of maltreated adolescents. In the present paper, an 85-item Client Information Record was completed on 2,019 runaways by shelter staff from eight southeastern states. There were significant differences in the problems reported by physically abused and sexually abused runaways when compared to their nonabused runaway peers. Runaways who were both physically and sexually maltreated were significantly more vulnerable and much worse off than those who only experienced either physical or sexual abuse. Implications for the treatment of maltreated runaways are discussed.

AB  - This study investigated whether runaway behavior could be related to six problematic areas. Selected scales of the Personality Inventory for Children, representative of the six areas, were hypothesized to discriminate between an adolescent runaway group and a control group. Four scales correctly classified 95.1% of the runaway subjects and 100% of the control subjects with a total correct classification rate of 97.52%. It was further hypothesized that the runaway group was not significantly different from a known clinical group with moderate to severe psychopathology. Results indicated that the runaway group was not significantly different except on one scale, Delinquency (DLQ). On the DLQ scale the runaway group had a significantly higher mean score than the clinical group. Application and recommendations are presented.

AB  - Background: Women who live in disadvantaged circumstances in Canada exhibit dietary intakes below recommended levels, but their children often do not. One reason for this difference may be that mothers modify their own food intake to spare their children nutritional deprivation. The objective of our study was to document whether or not low-income lone mothers compromise their own diets to feed their children.Methods: We studied 141 low-income lone mothers with at least 2 children under the age of 14 years who lived in Atlantic Canada. Women were identified through community organizations using a variety of recruitment strategies. The women were asked weekly for 1 month to recall their food intake over the previous 24 hours; they also reported their children's (n = 333) food intake. Mothers also completed a questionnaire about "food insecurity," that is, a lack of access to adequate, nutritious food through socially acceptable means, during each interview.Results: Household food insecurity was reported by 78% of mothers during the study month. Mothers' dietary intakes and the adequacy of intake were consistently poorer than their children's intake overall and over the course of a month. The difference in adequacy of intake between mothers and children widened from Time 1, when the family had the most money to purchase food, to Time 4, when the family had the least money. The children experienced some improvement in nutritional intake at Time 3, which was possibly related to food purchases for them associated with receipt of the Child Tax Benefit Credit or the Goods and Services Tax Credit.Interpretation: Our study demonstrates that low-income lone mothers compromise their own nutritional intake in order to preserve the adequacy of their children's diets.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health promotion and disease prevention have been increasingly recognized as activities that may be within the scope of emergency medicine. The purpose of this feasibility study was to identify health risks and offer immediate interventions to adult patients who have drug and/or alcohol problems, incomplete immunization, are overdue for a Pap (Papanicolaou) smear, and/or are smokers. METHODS: The study took place in a busy tertiary Emergency Department (ED) serving an inner-city population with a significant proportion of patients who are homeless, substance abusers, working poor, and/or recent immigrants. A convenience sample of patients completed a computer-based health-risk survey. Trained health promotion nurses offered appropriate interventions to patients following review and discussion of their self-reported data. Interventions included counseling for problem drinking, substance abuse, and smoking cessation, screening for cervical cancer, and immunization. RESULTS: From October 20, 2000 to June 30, 2003, we enrolled 2366 patients. One thousand and eleven subjects (43%) reported substance abuse and 1095 (46%) were smokers. Of the 158 smokers contacted in follow-up, 19 (12%) had quit, 63 (40%) had reduced the number of cigarettes/day and 76 (48%) reported no change. Of 1248 women surveyed, 307 (25%) were overdue for a Pap smear and 54 (18%) received this intervention. Forty-four percent of subjects were overdue for at least one immunization and of those, 414 (40%) were immunized in the ED. CONCLUSION: At-risk patients can be identified using a computer-based screening tool, and appropriate interventions can be given to a proportion of these patients in a busy inner city ED without increasing wait time.

AB  - This paper evaluates and contrasts the effectiveness of two culturally sensitive AIDS education programs developed by the UCLA AIDS Nursing Network and delivered to 213 impoverished Latina homeless or drug-addicted women in Los Angeles. The Comprehensive Health Seeking and Coping Paradigm guided the program, which was implemented by specially trained Latina nurses and outreach workers. A quasi-experimental design was employed where women were randomized by site into Specialized (N = 82) and Traditional (N = 131) programs. Repeated measures ANOVAS and log-linear models were used to evaluate improvement over a two-week period for women in both groups and to identify interactions with program type. Two-week posttest analyses were also conducted to assess program effectiveness, controlling for baseline values of the measure in question, nonequivalency between groups at baseline, and selected demographic characteristics, including acculturation. Results indicated that women in both AIDS education programs improved significantly in cognitive, behavioral, and psychologic outcomes.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify specific premorbid factors and injury characteristics associated with intentional burn injuries and to compare outcomes for individuals injured by assault and those with unintentional injuries. Participants sustaining major burns from May 1994 to August 2005 and consenting to a multisite, prospective, longitudinal outcome study were included. Etiology of the injury was classified as intentional (i.e., assault) or unintentional. Subjects <18 years old or with self-inflicted burns were excluded. Statistical analysis was performed with t-tests, chi2 tests, and analysis of variance. Eighty patients sustained intentional burn injuries and 1982 subjects sustained nonintentional burn injuries. Compared to patients with nonintentional burns, those with burns related to assault were more likely to be female, black, and unemployed and to have higher rates of premorbid substance use. Between the groups, there were no significant differences in preinjury living situation, education level, history of psychiatric treatment, or hospital length of stay. The intentional-burn group had larger burns and a greater in-hospital mortality rate, and these patients were less likely to be discharged to home. They also demonstrated significantly greater levels of psychological distress during the acute hospitalization but not at follow-up. Understanding the unique characteristics and needs of patients with intentional burn injuries is important because these individuals are less likely to have a steady income and more likely to rely on community social services. Affordable and accessible community-based health services are necessary in order to improve their outcomes.

AB  - Disparities in survival among people with AIDS continue in the treatment era, with a higher rate of death among African Americans than among Whites, Latinos, and Asians/Pacific Islanders (API). Few studies have been able to identify underlying reasons for this disparity. The authors' objectives were to determine the extent of disparities in AIDS-related death by race/ethnicity, and examine factors that may contribute to or explain these differences. Using San Francisco surveillance data, racial/ethnic differences in survival among residents diagnosed with AIDS between 1996 and 2002 were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazards regression techniques. The data confirm that a disparity in survival after AIDS persists between African Americans and Whites, Latinos, and APIs in San Francisco. Underlying causes of this disparity are multiple, but many of them are amenable to intervention and should be addressed.

AB  - Study Objectives: To investigate the characteristics of tuberculosis infection in diabetic patients at Bellevue Hospital.Design: We conducted a case-control study retrospectively reviewing the records of patients at Bellevue Hospital Center from 1987 to 1997 with a discharge diagnosis of tuberculosis and diabetes mellitus.Setting: Bellevue Hospital Center is a 1,200-bed, inner-city municipal hospital located in the Lower East Side of New York City.Patients: Fifty-three identified patients had verified tuberculosis infection and diabetes; of these, 50 charts were available for review. One hundred five control cases were selected from nondiabetic patients with a discharge diagnosis of tuberculosis during the same time period.Measurements and Results: Thirty-six percent (18 cases) of the patients with diabetes and tuberculosis had multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) compared to only 10% (10 cases) in the control group (p < 0.01) Controlling for homelessness, HIV status, and directly observed therapy, the relative risk of MDR-TB was calculated to be 8.6 (confidence interval, 3.1 to 23.6) in the diabetic group compared to the control group.Conclusions: There was a significant association between diabetes and MDR-TB. Diabetes continues to be a risk factor for tuberculosis and was associated with MDR-TB in our patients.

AB  - This was a study involving systematic random samples of 225 male and 232 female military veterans respectively that had received services at a VAMC in the South. The purpose was to examine what ecological factors predict a diagnosis of PTSD among those veterans. As expected, gender differences in relevant predictors of PTSD were observed: Generally, interpersonal factors, depression and fearfulness were more important to PTSD women. Among men, self-efficacy, resilience, suicidal thoughts, alcohol and other drug abuse, and combat stress were more relevant. However, physical and non-physical abuses in the family-of-origin were significantly related to PTSD for both women and men, albeit those abuses were more important for female veterans. Conceptual and family social work implications of the study were discussed.

AB  - Objective: To determine immunization and pre-school surveillance coverage of children who had been resident in a refuge for women victims of domestic violence. Design: A retrospective audit of immunization and surveillance coverage. Setting: A women's refuge in Cardiff, UK. Subjects: Seventy-one children, resident in one refuge during a given year. Main outcome measures: Immunization status and uptake of pre-school surveillance recorded on the Child Health System compared with age corrected figures for the whole district and a general practice in a socio-economically deprived area of Cardiff. Results: Immunization and pre-school surveillance were significantly lower in the refuge group than in either control group. Conclusion: These children had poor access to health care services, in this instance leaving them vulnerable to preventable infectious diseases and the sequelae of late diagnosis of remediable physical and developmental problems. This mirrors the situation of the wider group of the 'homeless' to which they belong, but they also have the burden of the violence from which their mothers have fled. These children, to whom the 'Inverse Care Law' seems to apply, deserve further study of their health status. They are one of several marginalized groups who remain 'budget unattractive' to general practitioners and whose health and health care seems at risk owing to the erosion of the public health role of the health visitor. Implications for practice: Commissioners, community child health departments and primary care teams need to establish partnerships with local refuges to improve health services. Further study of the health and health care needs of these children is indicated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify factors related to dropping out from tuberculosis treatment in health centers in the departments of Managua and Matagalpa, in Nicaragua. METHODS: This study matched cases and controls (1:1 ratio) by age and by municipality of treatment. The 251 cases were patients over 15 years of age who had dropped out of tuberculosis treatment, and the 251 controls were patients who had completed pharmacotherapy, during the period of January 1998 to December 2001. Data were obtained on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, lifestyle habits, and treatment characteristics. The variables were chosen and grouped using a hierarchical theoretical model. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: The risk factors for dropping out of tuberculosis drug treatment were: male gender (OR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.63 to 3.94), an unstable living situation or being homeless (OR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.57 to 6.49), changing residence during the treatment period (OR, 4.22; 95% CI, 2.06 to 9.93), consuming alcoholic beverages (OR, 5.25; 95% CI, 2.43 to 12.94), using illegal drugs (OR, 5.25; 95% CI, 2.43 to 12.94), difficulty in access to the health services (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.39 to 5.29), and a negative opinion of the health care received (OR, 5.33; 95% CI, 1.52 to 28.56). CONCLUSIONS: It is essential for the health services in Nicaragua to develop measures to reduce the risk of dropout from treatment. In particular, it is important for the health sector to work with community groups that can support the health sector's activities.

AB  - AIDS has been reported in Africa to push households into poverty and chronic food insecurity. At the same time there are reports of significant household resilience to AIDS. This study explored how a mature epidemic in rural Uganda has affected rural farming households. It focused on gender differences in the experience of AIDS and, in particular, household capabilities to sustain livelihoods. The study compared the vulnerability of male- and female-headed households in relation to their ability to mitigate human resource losses, as well as their access to natural and physical resources, to social networks and to finance capital for production. The findings suggest that when rural households are affected by AIDS, depleting productive resources and directing resources towards immediate needs, there are gender differences in responses to, and in impacts of, the epidemic due to the different resources available to male- and female- headed households. Female-headed households were found to be more vulnerable to AIDS than male-headed counterparts. Women's remarriage opportunities were lower than men's, they faced greater risk of losing control over land and livestock and they accessed less state and private sector support. Women-headed households were more dependent on livelihood support from non-governmental organizations, which were found to provide both welfare and credit support to female-headed households affected by AIDS. Women were found to play an important role in social networks and resources at community level but themselves received little support from many formal community networks and services.

AB  - Background: Tuberculosis (TB) control programs face the challenges of decreasing incidence, mortality rates, and drug resistance while increasing treatment adherence. The Brazilian TB control program recommended the decentralization of patient care as a strategy for combating the disease. This study evaluated the performance of this policy in an area with high default rates, comparing epidemiological and operational indicators between two similar municipalities.Methods: This study analyzed epidemiological and operational indicators on new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis reported in the Brazilian Notifiable Diseases Information System between 2006 and 2015. In addition, to characterize differences between the populations of the two studied municipalities, a prospective cohort study was conducted between 2014 and 2015, in which patients with new cases of culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis were interviewed and monitored until the disease outcome. A descriptive analysis, the chi-square test, and a Poisson regression model were employed to compare TB treatment outcomes and health care indicators between the municipalities.Results: Two thousand three hundred nine cases were evaluated, of which 207 patients were interviewed. Over the 2006-2015 period, TB incidence per 100,000 population in the municipality with decentralized care was significantly higher (39%, 95% CI 27-49%) in comparison to that of the municipality with centralized care. TB treatment default rate (45%, 95% CI 12-90%) was also higher in the municipality with decentralized care. During the two-year follow-up, significant differences were found between patients in centralized care and those in decentralized care regarding treatment success (84.5 vs. 66.1%), treatment default (10.7 vs. 25.8%), illicit drug use (27.7 vs. 45.9%), and homelessness (3.6 vs. 12.9%). The operational indicators revealed that the proportion of control smear tests, medical imaging, and HIV tests were all significantly higher in the centralized care. However, a significantly higher proportion of patients started treatment in the early stages of the disease in the municipality with decentralized care.Conclusions: These data showed a low success rate in TB treatment in both municipalities. Decentralization of TB care, alone, did not improve the main epidemiological and operational indicators related to disease control when compared to centralized care. Full implementation of strategies already recommended is needed to improve TB treatment success rates.

AB  - School dropouts are considered an important target group for AIDS prevention. They are expected to be less knowledgeable about AIDS and to show a higher degree of risky behavior as compared with their school-attending peers. Several small-scale studies among specific groups of dropouts seem to confirm such expectations. However, due to differences in methodology, it is often difficult to compare the results of such studies with findings for youths who have not dropped out of school. The present study sought to remedy this by examining AIDS-related knowledge, attitudes, and behavior among comparable samples of Dutch secondary school students and dropouts (excluding homeless and drug-addicted adolescents). The two groups were compared with regard to knowledge about AIDS prevention, attitude toward condom use, intention to use condoms, sexual history, and condom use. Contrary to expectations, few differences were found. It was concluded that, in most respects, dropouts are similar to those who have remained in school.

AB  - In this paper we examine risk behavior, exposure to street outreach, and condom use in samples of injecting drug users (IDUs) and high-risk youth. We used systematic sampling methods to produce representative samples of injecting drug users IDUs (five sites) and high-risk youth (three sites). The populations surveyed engaged in high levels of sexual risk behavior: 20% to 46% reported two or more sex partners in the last month. The majority (62% to 97%) knew someone infected with HIV. Condom use rates approached national health promotion goals for nonsteady partners but not for steady or main partners. Having a condom at time of interview was the most consistent predictor of condom use at last intercourse. Many of the respondents have been in contact with street outreach programs and many acknowledged some personal risk for HIV infection. However, most of the injecting drug users and high-risk youth interviewed (and their sex partners) were still at risk through unprotected sex.

AB  - This study reports on the characteristics of street youth in treatment in Ontario. Data came from eleven substance abuse treatment programs. It was found that street youth in treatment had a larger number of social and drug abuse problems than did non-street youth. They were more likely to be unemployed, on welfare, and to have legal problems. They had more depression and lower self-esteem, and use more alcohol and drugs. Discharged street and non-street youth had similar lengths of stay and drop-out rates in one residential program and similar, although limited, amounts of treatment in outpatient programs. However, street youth were more likely to leave outpatient programs without telling staff. The need for more experimentation in the provision of service for youth is identified.

AB  - The aim was to test the assumption that mass miniature x ray screening of the single homeless (hostel residents) is a cost-effective means of controlling pulmonary tuberculosis. The study was a prospective experimental screening exercise to identify new cases of active tuberculosis completing treatment. The setting was eight hostels in south London. A mobile x ray screening facility was set up outside the hostels. Subjects were 547 single homeless residents in the hostels. They were encouraged to attend for chest x ray, and for active follow up of abnormal x rays. No new cases of active tuberculosis were found. Mass miniature x ray is ineffective in controlling tuberculosis because of its unacceptability and increasing inaccessibility to this population.

AB  - We assessed changes in cognitive, psychological, and risky behavior latent variables after traditional or specialized AIDS education after 2 years using structural equation modeling (SEM) in a sample of impoverished at-risk African American women (N = 300). Both groups reported significant improvement at 2 years in their self-esteem and social resources. They also reported less threat perception, avoidant coping, emotional disturbance, HIV risk behavior, and drug use behavior. There was an advantage to specialized group membership. When compared with the traditional group at 2 years, women in the specialized group reported enhanced social resources, reduced emotional distress, less use of an avoidant coping style, and less drug use. We discuss advantages of culturally sensitive HIV risk reduction programs and the importance of connecting women with social services in their communities.

AB  - A study of 22 glue sniffers and 22 non-sniffers was carried out with individuals from the same reference group. The subjects were all street children living in supervised shelters. No statistically significant differences were found between the sniffers and non-sniffers on cognitive measures or biographical features (e.g. time spent at school, years on the street). When rated by shelter staff on a modified version of the Christiansen Rating Scale (1967) the sniffers were perceived to be significantly more disturbed in their relationships with others, however, methodological issues do not permit conclusive evidence of behavioural differences to be drawn. The authors conclude that the findings lend support for the view that the effects of volatile substance abuse on cognitive and personality functioning cannot be clearly demonstrated.

AB  - Background: While homelessness among youth is a serious problem, there is little information about evidence-based interventions for homeless youth. In cooperation with professionals and youths, Wolf (2012) developed Houvast (Dutch for 'grip'): a strengths based method grounded in scientific and practice evidence. The main aim of Houvast is to improve the quality of life of homeless youths by focusing on their strengths, thus stimulating their capacity for autonomy and self-reliance.Method/design: The effectiveness and fidelity of Houvast will be tested in ten Dutch services for homeless youth which are randomly allocated to an intervention group (n = 5), or a control group which provides care as usual (n = 5). Measurements of both objective and subjective quality of life and secondary outcomes (mental and physical health, substance use, coping, resilience, psychological needs, care needs, working relationship with the professional and attainment of personal goals) will be conducted among homeless youths (n = 251). Youths in both groups will be interviewed by means of a structured interview at baseline, at time of ending care or after having received care for six months (T1) and at nine months after baseline (T2). Model fidelity will be tested around T1.Discussion: This study is unique as it includes a large number of homeless youths who are followed for a period of nine months, and because it focuses on a strengths based approach. If the Houvast method proves to be effective in improving quality of life it will be the first evidence-based intervention for homeless youth.Trial Registration: [corrected] Netherlands Trail Register (NTR):NTR3254.

AB  - Experts in the fields of child development, psychology, and criminology agree that family system variables play a key role in the development of delinquent and other deviant behaviors. Professionals in the field of substance abuse estimate that there may be at least 22 million children who have been or are currently being raised in homes with substance-abusing parents. Many studies have documented the relationships between being raised in such an environment and a variety of emotional and deviant characteristics. These individuals have been found to suffer from low self-esteem, depression, anger, and a variety of acting-out behaviors. This study investigated the differences between incarcerated juveniles from substance-abusing families and those from non-substances-abusing families. Significant differences were found in the areas of family violence, abuse; runaway, and self-reported substance abuse.

AB  - The purpose of my research was to explore the health experiences of runaway and homeless girls living on the streets in a metropolitan city in the Southwest, describe the meanings of their health experiences, and identify the factors that were beneficial or detrimental to their health while living on the street. The study centered on the participants' health experiences within the contexts of gender and culture as understood through their narrative epiphany experiences. Purposeful sampling was used to obtain the sample of 10 English speaking participants, female adolescents between 14 and 20 years of age who self-identified as runaway and who were living on the street at the time of the interview. Denzin's (1989) interpretive interactionism method framed the research process. Data collection included focus group discussions and individual interviews with participants that were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Additional sources of data were written fieldnotes and participant observations in the field. During the construction step of the interpretive process sub-themes were classified and ordered under three categories, The Adventure: Street Health, The Risk: Taking Chances, and The Trial: Have Agency. As the commonalities among these sub-themes emerged, these were linked to form the cumulative epiphany, 'Health on the street as process of adventure, risk and trial.' Four minor themes were described within this process, Health is unimportant: Until you're feeling ill; The alcohol and other drug (AOD) filter: It's just the dope; Health as gendered process: The meaning of Blue; and Crossing cultural borders: How we negotiate street life. The majority of runaway girls demonstrated agency in regard to caring for their health and the health of others on the street; they were resourceful. Girls who inject drugs or drink alcohol discount feelings of illness and attribute their bodily symptoms to the drug itself. Youth who are under the influence of AOD do not seek health care because they believe they will be treated differently than if they had a 'naturally' caused illness. Negotiating cultural borders is a metaphor for the developmental transition of exiting the street.

AB  - Background: Patients experiencing homelessness represent a disproportionate share of emergency department (ED) visits due to poor access to primary care and high levels of unmet health care needs. This is in part due to the difficulty of communicating and following up with patients who are experiencing homelessness.Objective: To determine the prevalence and types of "new media" use among ED patients who experience homelessness.Methods: This was a cross-sectional observational study with sequential enrolling of patients from three emergency departments 24/7 for 6 weeks. In total, 5788 ED patients were enrolled, of whom 249 experienced homelessness. Analyses included descriptive statistics, and unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios.Results: 70.7% (176/249) of patients experiencing homelessness own cell phones compared to 85.90% (4758/5539) of patients in stable housing (P=.001) with the former more likely to own Androids, 70% (53/76) versus 43.89% (1064/2424), and the latter more likely to have iPhones, 44.55% (1080/2424) versus 17% (13/76) (P=.001). There is no significant difference in new media use, modality, or frequency for both groups; however, there is a difference in contract plan with 50.02% (2380/4758) of stably housed patients having unlimited minutes versus 37.5% (66/176) of homeless patients. 19.78% (941/4758) of patients in stable housing have pay-as-you-go plans versus 33.0% (58/176) of homeless patients (P=.001). Patients experiencing homelessness are more likely to want health information on alcohol/substance abuse, mental health, domestic violence, pregnancy and smoking cessation.Conclusions: This study is unique in its characterization of new media ownership and use among ED patients experiencing homelessness. New media is a powerful tool to connect patients experiencing homelessness to health care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: New injection drug users (IDUs) are at high risk for blood-borne viral infections. Given U.S. policy to only fund proven-effective HIV prevention interventions, insights into conducting intervention trials among young IDUs are provided here by describing methods and participants' characteristics in the CIDUS III/DUIT study. METHODS: In 2002-2004, 15-30-year-old IDUs in Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle were recruited through community outreach, advertising and coupon-based participant referrals. Baseline interviews assessed sociodemographics, injection, and sexual behaviors. Antibody tests for HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses (HAV, HBV, and HCV) were conducted. IDUs who were HIV and HCV antibody negative at baseline were eligible to participate in a randomized controlled HIV/HCV prevention trial. Follow-up assessments were conducted 3 and 6 months post-intervention. Data were analyzed to identify participant differences at baseline by city, trial enrollment, and trial retention. RESULTS: Baseline assessments were completed by 3285 IDUs. Participants were mean age 23.8 years, 69% male, 64% White, 17% Hispanic, and 8% Black. Seroprevalence of HIV, HCV, HBV, and HAV antibodies were 2.9, 34.4, 22.4, and 19.3%, respectively. Of the 2062 (62.7%) baseline participants who were HIV and HCV antibody negative, 859 (41.7%) were randomized. At least one follow-up assessment was completed by 712 (83%) randomized participants. Contextual factors, primarily homelessness, were associated with lower enrollment and retention. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment and retention of young-adult IDUs for complex intervention trials is complicated, yet feasible. Risk behaviors among participants enrolling in and completing the trial reflected those eligible to enroll.

AB  - Background: Childhood overweight is not restricted to developed countries: a number of lower- and middle-income countries are struggling with the double burden of underweight and overweight. Another public health problem that concerns both developing and, to a lesser extent, developed countries is food insecurity. This study presents a comparative gender-based analysis of the association between household food insecurity and overweight among 10-to-11-year-old children living in the Canadian province of Québec and in the country of Jamaica.Methods: Analyses were performed using data from the 2008 round of the Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development and the Jamaica Youth Risk and Resiliency Behaviour Survey of 2007. Cross-sectional data were obtained from 1190 10-year old children in Québec and 1674 10-11-year-old children in Jamaica. Body mass index was derived using anthropometric measurements and overweight was defined using Cole's age- and sex-specific criteria. Questionnaires were used to collect data on food insecurity. The associations were examined using chi-square tests and multivariate regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals.Results: The prevalence of overweight was 26% and 11% (p < 0.001) in the Québec and Jamaican samples, respectively. In Québec, the adjusted odds ratio for being overweight was 3.03 (95% CI: 1.8-5.0) among children living in food-insecure households, in comparison to children living in food-secure households. Furthermore, girls who lived in food-insecure households had odds of 4.99 (95% CI: 2.4-10.5) for being overweight in comparison to girls who lived in food-secure households; no such differences were observed among boys. In Jamaica, children who lived in food-insecure households had significantly lower odds (OR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.4-0.9) for being overweight in comparison to children living in food-secure households. No gender differences were observed in the relationship between food-insecurity and overweight/obesity among Jamaican children.Conclusions: Public health interventions which aim to stem the epidemic of overweight/obesity should consider gender differences and other family factors associated with overweight/obesity in both developed and developing countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Delivery of effective primary, secondary, and tertiary injury prevention in homeless populations is complex and could be greatly aided by an improved understanding of contributing factors. METHODS: Injury and health conditions were examined for hospitalized New York City homeless persons (n = 326,073) and low socioeconomic status (SES) housed residents (n = 1,202,622) using 2000 to 2002 New York statewide hospital discharge data (Statewide Program and Research Cooperative System). Age- and gender-adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated within age groups of 0.1 years to 9 years, 10 years to 19 years, 20 years to 64 years, and >=65 years, with low SES housed as the comparison group. RESULTS: Comorbid conditions, injury, and injury mechanisms varied by age, gender, race or ethnicity, and housing status. Odds of unintentional injury in homeless versus low SES housed were higher in younger children aged 0 years to 9 years (1.34, 1.27-1.42), adults (1.13, 1.09-1.18), and elderly (1.25, 1.20-1.30). Falls were increased by 30% in children, 14% in adolescents or teenagers, and 47% in the elderly. More than one-quarter (26.9%) of fall hospitalizations in homeless children younger than 5 years were due to falls from furniture with more than threefold differences observed in both 3 year and 4 year olds (p = 0.0001). Several comorbid conditions with potential to complicate injury and postinjury care were increased in homeless including nutritional deficiencies, infections, alcohol and drug use, and mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Although homelessness presents unique, highly complex social and health issues that tend to overshadow the need for and the value of injury prevention, this study highlights potentially fruitful areas for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.

AB  - Question: Can a skills training intervention reduce sexual risk behaviours in homeless men who have mental illness? Design: Randomised controlled trial with 6 and 18 months follow up. Setting; 200 bed municipal men's shelter in New York City, New York, USA. Patients: 97 men attending a psychiatric outreach programme. 59 of the men were sexually active at baseline (defined as having had vaginal or oral sex in the past 6 mo); most were >/= 35 years of age (58%), African-American (58%) or Latino (35%), had not completed high school (56% and had psychiatric diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (57%) or major or bipolar depression (27%). For sexually active men, follow up was 100% at 6 months and 95% at 18 months. Intervention: 52 men were allocated to the Sex, Games, and Videotapes (SexG) intervention, which involved 15 interactive sessions (2 d/wk for 8 wks) facilitated by a mental health professional and a paraprofessional. Activities included storytelling, competitive games, acting scenes from their daily lives, and practising the decision making skills required for consistent condom use. 45 men were allocated to the control intervention which involved 2 sessions on HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases and basic instruction on condom use. Main outcome measures: Main outcome was a sexual risk index (the Vaginal Episode Equivalent [VEE]) based on a semistructured interview given by interviewers blinded to the participant's group assignment. The index assigned scores for each unprotected anal, vaginal, and oral sexual episode. Other outcomes included episodes of sex, episodes with condom use, and high risk episodes (multiple partners and unprotected anal or vaginal sex). Main results: Intention to treat analysis focused on the subgroup of men who were sexually active at baseline (n = 33 in the SexG group and n = 26 in the control group). At 6 months, sexually active men in the SexG group had a lower mean VEE index than sexually active men in the control group (1.0 v 3.1, p = 0.01). Although the total number of episodes of sex were similar for the 2 groups (261 v 247), the SexG group had a higher proportion of episodes with condom use than the control group (73% v 52%, p = 0.04), and a lower proportion of high risk episodes (24% v 58%, p=0.01). The between group difference in mean VEE scores decreased over time from 2.1 at 6 months to 1.6 at 18 months. Among the 38 men who were not sexually active at baseline (n = 19 in each group), the SexG group did not differ from the control group for number who were sexually active (11 v 9) or had unprotected sex (5 v 6) at 18 months. Conclusion: A skills training intervention reduced high risk sexual behaviours in sexually active homeless men who had mental illness.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to examine: 1) the relationship between being a runaway and the time since the first absconding event and adolescent substance use; 2) whether different kinds of psychoactive substances have a different temporal relationship to the first absconding event; and 3) whether the various reasons for the first absconding event are associated with different risks of substance use.Methods: Participants were drawn from the 2004-2006 nationwide outreach programs across 26 cities/towns in Taiwan. A total of 17,133 participants, age 12-18 years, who completed an anonymous questionnaire on their experience of running away and substances use and who were now living with their families, were included in the analysis.Results: The lifetime risk of tobacco, alcohol, betel nut, and illegal drug/inhalant use increased steadily from adolescents who had experienced a trial runaway episode (one time lasting <or= 1 day), to those with extended runaway experience (>or= 2 times or lasting > 1 day), when compared to those who had never ran away. Adolescents who had their first running away experience > 6 months previously had a greater risk of betel nut or illegal drug/inhalant use over the past 6-months than those with a similar experience within the last 6 months. Both alcohol and tobacco use were most frequently initiated before the first running away, whereas both betel nut and illegal drug/inhalant use were most frequently initiated after this event. When adolescents who were fleeing an unsatisfactory home life were compared to those who ran away for excitement, the risk of alcohol use was similar but the former tended to have a higher risk of tobacco, betel nut, and illegal drug/inhalant use.Conclusions: More significant running away and a longer time since the first absconding experience were associated with more advanced substance involvement among adolescents now living in a family setting. Once adolescents had left home, they developed additional psychoactive substance problems, regardless of their reasons for running away. These findings have implications for caregivers, teachers, and healthcare workers when trying to prevent and/or intervening in adolescent substance use.

AB  - Background: The outbreak of the pandemic flu, Influenza A H1N1 (Swine Flu) in early 2009, provided a major challenge to health services around the world. Previous pandemics have led to stockpiling of goods, the victimisation of particular population groups, and the cancellation of travel and the boycotting of particular foods (e.g. pork). We examined initial behavioural and attitudinal responses towards Influenza A, H1N1 ("Swine flu") in the six days following the WHO pandemic alert level 5, and regional differences in these responses.Methods: 328 respondents completed a cross-sectional Internet or paper-based questionnaire study in Malaysia (N = 180) or Europe (N = 148). Measures assessed changes in transport usage, purchase of preparatory goods for a pandemic, perceived risk groups, indicators of anxiety, assessed estimated mortality rates for seasonal flu, effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccination, and changes in pork consumptionResults: 26% of the respondents were 'very concerned' about being a flu victim (42% Malaysians, 5% Europeans, p < .001). 36% reported reduced public transport use (48% Malaysia, 22% Europe, p < .001), 39% flight cancellations (56% Malaysia, 17% Europe, p < .001). 8% had purchased preparatory materials (e.g. face masks: 8% Malaysia, 7% Europe), 41% Malaysia (15% Europe) intended to do so (p < .001). 63% of Europeans, 19% of Malaysians had discussed the pandemic with friends (p < .001). Groups seen as at 'high risk' of infection included the immune compromised (mentioned by 87% respondents), pig farmers (70%), elderly (57%), prostitutes/highly sexually active (53%), and the homeless (53%). In data collected only in Europe, 64% greatly underestimated the mortality rates of seasonal flu, 26% believed seasonal flu vaccination gave protection against swine flu. 7% had reduced/stopped eating pork. 3% had purchased anti-viral drugs for use at home, while 32% intended to do so if the pandemic worsened.Conclusion: Initial responses to Influenza A show large regional differences in anxiety, with Malaysians more anxious and more likely to reduce travel and to buy masks and food. Discussions with family and friends may reinforce existing anxiety levels. Particular groups (homosexuals, prostitutes, the homeless) are perceived as at greater risk, potentially leading to increased prejudice during a pandemic. Europeans underestimated mortality of seasonal flu, and require more information about the protection given by seasonal flu inoculation.

AB  - This is one of three Cochrane reviews that examine the role of the telephone in HIV/AIDS services. Both in developed and developing countries there is a large proportion of people who do not know they are infected with HIV. Knowledge of one's own HIV serostatus is necessary to access HIV support, care and treatment and to prevent acquisition or further transmission of HIV. Using telephones instead of face-to-face or other means of HIV test results delivery could lead to more people receiving their HIV test results. To assess the effectiveness of telephone use for delivery of HIV test results and post-test counselling.To evaluate the effectiveness of delivering HIV test results by telephone, we were interested in whether they can increase the proportion of people who receive their HIV test results and the number of people knowing their HIV status. We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PubMed Central, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health (CINAHL), WHOs The Global Health Library and Current Controlled Trials from 1980 to June 2011. We also searched grey literature sources such as Dissertation Abstracts International,CAB Direct Global Health, OpenSIGLE, The Healthcare Management Information Consortium, Google Scholar, Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, International AIDS Society and AEGIS Education Global Information System, and reference lists of relevant studies for this review. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials (qRCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series (ITS) studies comparing the effectiveness of telephone HIV test results notification and post-test counselling to face-to-face or other ways of HIV test result delivery in people regardless of their demographic characteristics and in all settings. Two reviewers independently searched, screened, assessed study quality and extracted data. A third reviewer resolved any disagreement. Out of 14 717 citations, only one study met the inclusion criteria; an RCT conducted on homeless and high-risk youth between September 1998 and October 1999 in Portland, United States. Participants (n=351) were offered counselling and oral HIV testing and were randomised into face-to-face (n=187 participants) and telephone (n=167) notification groups. The telephone notification group had the option of receiving HIV test results either by telephone or face-to-face. Overall, only 48% (n=168) of participants received their HIV test results and post-test counselling. Significantly more participants received their HIV test results in the telephone notification group compared to the face-to-face notification group; 58% (n=106) vs. 37% (n=62) (p < 0.001). In the telephone notification group, the majority of participants who received their HIV test results did so by telephone (88%, n=93). The study could not offer information about the effectiveness of telephone HIV test notification with HIV-positive participants because only two youth tested positive and both were assigned to the face-to-face notification group. The study had a high risk of bias. We found only one eligible study. Although this study showed the use of the telephone for HIV test results notification was more effective than face-to-face delivery, it had a high-risk of bias. The study was conducted about 13 years ago in a high-income country, on a high-risk population, with low HIV prevalence, and the applicability of its results to other settings and contexts is unclear. The study did not provide information about telephone HIV test results notification of HIV positive people since none of the intervention group participants were HIV positive. We found no information about the acceptability of the intervention to patients' and providers', its economic outcomes or potential adverse effects. There is a need for robust evidence from various settings on the effectiveness of telephone use for HIV test results notification.[CINAHL Note: The Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews contain interactive software that allows various calculations in the MetaView.]

AB  - Background: A 2004 UNICEF/UNAIDS/USAID survey in Blantyre, Malawi, examined methods to improve monitoring and evaluation of interventions aimed at orphans and vulnerable children.Objective: A derivative of this larger study, the present study utilized the household data collected to assess differences in food security status among orphan households with the aim of helping food security programmers focus resources on the households most affected.Methods: Orphan households were classified by number and type of orphans supported. Descriptive analyses and logistic regressions were performed to assess differential vulnerability to food insecurity according to these classifications.Results: Multiple-orphan households and multiple-orphan households that cared for at least one foster child were 2.42 and 6.87 times more likely to be food insecure, respectively, than nonorphan households. No other category of orphan household was at elevated risk.Conclusions: The food security impact of caring for orphans varied significantly among orphan households, requiring food security planners to focus resources on the households most heavily impacted by HIV/AIDS, including multiple-orphan households, rather than focusing on conventional designations of vulnerability, such as orphans and vulnerable children.

AB  - Background: Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) of opiate users has been studied in treatment settings, where assistance for drug use was sought. In this study we ascertain factors related to HRQL of young opiate users recruited outside treatment facilities, considering both genders separately.Methods: Current opiate users (18-30 y) were recruited in outdoor settings in three Spanish cities (Barcelona, Madrid, Seville). Standardised laptop interviews included socio-demographic data, drug use patterns, health related issues, the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) and the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP).Results: A total of 991 subjects (73% males), mean age = 25.7 years were interviewed. The mean global NHP score differed by gender (women: 41.2 (sd:23.8); men:34.1(sd:23.6);p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis was implemented separately by gender, variables independently related with global NHP score, both for males and females, were heroin and cocaine SDS scores. For women, only other drug related variables (alcohol intake and length of cocaine use) were independently associated with their HRQL. HIV+ males who suffered an opiate overdose or had psychiatric care in the last 12 months perceived their health as poorer, while those who had ever been in methadone treatment in the last 12 months perceived it as better. The model with both genders showed all factors for males plus quantity of alcohol and an interaction between gender and HIV status.Conclusions: Heroin users were found to be at a considerable risk of impaired HRQL, even in these young ages. A score approaching severity of dependence was the factor with the strongest relation with it.

AB  - SYNOPSIS: Involvement in clinical trials of traditionally underserved populations such as minorities, the homeless, substance abusers, and those living in rural areas has been a focus of both the National Cancer Institute and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). What factors are barriers to recruitment, retention, and compliance (RRC) of these populations? This study identified issues and strategies used to resolve barriers by surveying 18 NIH-funded Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA). Telephone interviews were conducted with a nurse at each site at the initiation of the site funding and 6 months later when sites had begun enrollment. The authors provide insight into both client-centered and structural problems contributing to subjects' noncompliance. [Original article accession number: 1995014112 (research, tables/charts)]

AB  - SYNOPSIS: This study examined differences in health care status and utilization patterns between the general ED pediatric population and children residing in shelters. Over a 9-month period, sheltered families presenting to the ED were given an 18-item questionnaire. Simultaneously, age-matched control patients from the general ED population in a 2:1 ratio were given the same tool. Variables studied were family composition, number of children under 3 years of age, length of time living in the shelter, method of payment, appropriateness of well-child care, immunization status, and tuberculosis testing. Shelter families lived an average of 7.8 months in the shelter, had more children, were headed mainly by single mothers, and had higher rates of unemployment and uninsurance. Shelter children more frequently had delayed immunizations, lower rates of TB testing, fewer identified primary healthcare sites, and higher admission rates from the ED.

AB  - SYNOPSIS: Homelessness is a problem that has increased in size and in our consciousness. This study examined a sample (N=1,252) from one center in Los Angeles being cared for at the UCLA School for Nursing Health Center. Analysis of disease and risk factors in this population provided the model. The report included a population description, special characteristics relevant to research, and special needs of the homeless. The research designs and instruments that worked best with this group were case study or survey methods rather than experimental designs; designs that do not require follow-up, retesting, or frequent testing; and tools that require the researcher to do most of the data recording. It was found that obtaining a truly random sample was almost impossible. Homeless populations may vary in demographics and health characteristics, thus limiting generalizability of findings from one group to another.

AB  - Background: Patient adherence to medications, particularly for conditions requiring prolonged treatment such as tuberculosis, is frequently less than ideal, and can result in poor treatment outcomes. Material incentives (given as cash, vouchers and tokens), have been used to improve adherence.Objectives: To assess the effects of material incentives in people undergoing diagnostic testing, or receiving prophylactic or curative therapy, for tuberculosis.Search Methods: We undertook a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; Science Citation Index; and reference lists of relevant publications; to 22 June 2011.Selection Criteria: Randomized controlled trials of material incentives in patients being investigated for tuberculosis, or on treatment for latent or active disease.Data Collection and Analysis: At least two authors independently screened and selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. The effects of interventions are compared using risk ratios (RR), and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.Main Results: We identified 11 eligible studies. Ten were conducted in the USA: in adolescents (one trial), in injection drug or cocaine users (four trials), in homeless adults (three trials), and in prisoners (two trials). One additional trial recruited malnourished men receiving active treatment for tuberculosis in Timor-Leste.Material incentives may increase the return rate for reading of tuberculin skin test results compared to normal care (two trials, 1371 participants: RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.29, low quality evidence).Similarly, incentives probably improve clinic re-attendance for initiation or continuation of antituberculosis prophylaxis (three trials, 595 participants: RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.96, moderate quality evidence), and may improve subsequent completion of prophylaxis in some settings (three trials, 869 participants: RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 4.58, low quality evidence).We currently don't know if incentives can improve long-term adherence and completion of antituberculosis treatment for active disease. Only one trial has assessed this and the incentive, given as a daily hot meal, was not well received by the population due to the inconvenience of attending the clinic at midday (one trial, 265 participants, RR 0.98, 95%CI 0.86 to 1.12, very low quality evidence).Several trials have compared different forms or levels of incentive. These comparisons remain limited to single trials and robust conclusions cannot be made. In summary, cash incentives may be more effective than non-cash incentives (return for test results: one trial, 651 participants: RR 1.13, 95%CI 1.07 to 1.19, low quality evidence, adherence to tuberculosis prophylaxis: one trial, 141 participants: RR 1.26, 95%CI 1.02 to 1.56, low quality evidence) and higher amounts of cash may be more effective than lower amounts (return for test results: one trial, 404 participants: RR 1.08, 95%CI 1.01 to 1.16, low quality evidence).Material incentives may also be more effective than motivational education at improving return for tuberculin skin test results (low quality evidence), but may be no more effective than peer counselling, or structured education at improving continuation or completion of prophylaxis (low quality evidence).Authors' Conclusions: There is limited evidence to support the use of material incentives to improve return rates for tuberculosis diagnostic test results and adherence to antituberculosis preventive therapy. The data are currently limited to trials among predominantly male drug users, homeless, and prisoner subpopulations in the USA, and therefore the results are not easily generalised to the wider adult population, or to low- and middle-income countries, where the tuberculosis burden is highest.Further high-quality studies are needed to assess both the costs and effectiveness of incentives to improve adherence to long-term treatment of tuberculosis.
