N2  - BACKGROUND: People who inject drugs (PWID) have low rates of COVID-19 testing yet are vulnerable to severe disease. In partnership with a mobile syringe service program (SSP) in San Diego County, CA, we developed the evidence-, community-, and Social Cognitive Theory-informed "LinkUP" intervention (tailored education, motivational interviewing, problem-solving, and planning) to increase COVID-19 testing uptake among PWID., PURPOSE: To assess preliminary efficacy of LinkUP in increasing PWID COVID-19 testing in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT)., METHODS: We referred participants (PWID, >=18 years old, San Diego County residents who had not recently undergone voluntary COVID-19 testing) to mobile SSP sites that had been randomized (by week) to offer the active LinkUP intervention or didactic attention-control conditions delivered by trained peer counselors. Following either condition, counselors offered on-site rapid COVID-19 antigen testing. Analyses estimated preliminary intervention efficacy and explored potential moderation., RESULTS: Among 150 participants, median age was 40.5 years, 33.3% identified as Hispanic/Latinx, 64.7% were male, 73.3% were experiencing homelessness, and 44.7% had prior mandatory COVID-19 testing. The LinkUP intervention was significantly associated with higher COVID-19 testing uptake (p < .0001). Homelessness moderated intervention effects; LinkUP increased COVID-19 testing uptake more among participants experiencing homelessness (adjusted risk ratio [aRR]: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.56-2.09; p < .0001) than those not experiencing homelessness (aRR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.01-1.43; p = .04)., CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this pilot RCT support the preliminary efficacy of the "LinkUP" intervention to increase COVID-19 testing among PWID and underscore the importance of academic-community partnerships and prevention service delivery through SSPs and other community-based organizations serving vulnerable populations.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to quantify the degree to which an underserved, Hispanic population in Los Angeles is impacted by SARS-CoV-2, and determine factors associated with paediatric seropositivity., DESIGN: Cross-sectional., SETTING: AltaMed, a Federally Qualified Health Center in Los Angeles., PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of households who had received healthcare at AltaMed Medical Group was invited to participate. Households with at least one adult and one paediatric participant between 5 and 17 years of age were eligible to participate. Consented participants completed a survey on social determinants of health and were tested for antibodies using Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2-IgG and SARS-CoV-2-IgM tests., PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Seropositive status., RESULTS: We analysed 390 adults (mean age in years, 38.98 (SD 12.11)) and 332 paediatric participants (11.26 (SD 3.51)) from 196 households. Estimated seropositivity was 52.11% (95% CI 49.61% to 55.19%) in paediatric participants and 63.58% (95% CI 60.39% to 65.24%) in adults. Seropositivity was 11.47% (95% CI 6.82% to 14.09%) lower in paediatric participants, but high relative to other populations. A household member with type 2 diabetes (OR 2.94 (95% CI 1.68 to 5.14)), receipt of food stamps (OR 1.66 (95% CI 1.08 to 2.56)) and lower head-of-household education (OR 1.73 (95% CI 1.06 to 2.84)) were associated with paediatric seropositivity., CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity is high in Hispanic children and adolescents in Los Angeles. Food insecure households with low head-of-household education, and at least one household member with type 2 diabetes, had the highest risk. These factors may inform paediatrician COVID-19 mitigation recommendations., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04901624. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Lack of nutritional knowledge and ineffective attitudes can complicate the problems faced by this group of street children and have significant effects on their behaviors. This study aimed to examine the effect of nutrition education on nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of street children in Kerman in 2021., METHODS: This experimental study was conducted on 70 street children supported by Aftab Children Support Center in Kerman in 2021. The participants were selected using convenience sampling and were divided into two intervention and control groups using a random number table. A nutrition distance education program was implemented using an educational compact disk (CD) for the participants in the intervention group, while the children in the control group did not receive any training. The children's nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors were assessed before and one month after the intervention using the Nutritional Behavior Questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed with SPSS software (version 22) using the chi-square test, paired and independent samples t-test, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)., RESULTS: The results revealed a significant difference in nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors after the intervention (p < 0.001) due to the effect of the nutrition training program. Accordingly, the mean scores of the participants in the intervention group for nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors increased by 11.45, 14.80, and 6.05 units after the intervention compared to their scores before the intervention. Furthermore, the effects of the training program on the participants' nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors were 89.6%, 91.5%, and 64.3%, respectively., CONCLUSION: The findings of this study concluded that training based on nutrition education improved the children's nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Thus, the officials in charge of promoting the health of vulnerable groups in the community need to provide the necessary facilities to implement effective training programs for street children and encourage them to participate in training programs.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: As part of a larger community-based, service-driven research project, the primary purpose of this pilot randomized study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of delivering time-limited adaptations of parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT) and child-parent psychotherapy (CPP) within a sample of children experiencing homelessness. The secondary goal was to examine the promise of both interventions in improving parent/child outcomes., METHOD: One hundred forty-four young children (18 month-5 years old; Mage = 3.48, SD = 1.09; 43.1% female; 78.5% Black/African American; 27.1% Hispanic) and their mothers were recruited from a women's homeless shelter and randomly assigned to 12 weeks of either PCIT or CPP delivered by shelter clinicians on-site. Attendance, fidelity, and program satisfaction were obtained. Families completed pre- and postintervention assessments, including observational data on maternal verbalizations during a child-led play session., RESULTS: Both time-limited PCIT and time-limited CPP were successfully implemented with similarly high levels of intervention fidelity (>90%) and satisfaction by mothers (85%). Completion rates were similar across both time-limited PCIT (76.6%) and time-limited CPP (71.4%). Both time-limited CPP and PCIT resulted in decreases in children's posttraumatic stress, parental stress, and increases in maternal positive verbalizations. Only time-limited PCIT resulted in significant improvements in externalizing behavior problems in children and reductions in maternal negative verbalizations., CONCLUSIONS: Time-limited PCIT and CPP are acceptable, feasible, and hold significant promise for helping families within a homeless shelter environment and by extension, other transitional and/or shelter environments. A full randomized trial is warranted to determine which program may offer a more effective intervention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).

N2  - Children who experience homelessness display substantial variation in outcomes, but little attention has been given to potential mechanisms linking their housing experiences to their functioning. This study explores these mechanisms using qualitative coding of 80 interviews with parents participating in a randomized control trial of housing interventions for families experiencing homelessness. Interviews were conducted an average of 7 months after families entered a homeless shelter, when most families had exited shelters to a variety of other housing options. Many parents described children as faring poorly on behavioral and educational outcomes while in shelters but displaying improvement after leaving the shelter. Parents commonly viewed shelters as contributing to behavioral disruptions, with restored autonomy and routines after exiting shelters contributing to recovery in functioning. Parents offered long-term rental subsidies viewed having a stable, adequate place of their own as helping their children fare better from reduced family stress, improved routines, and changes in children's expectations about stability. Findings indicate the importance of understanding differences in housing stability and quality among families who experience homelessness for how children fare-including differences in how housing interventions affect stability and quality. Policies expanding access to long-term rental subsidies could help improve outcomes for children. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Social deprivation is a major risk factor of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Yet, there is few studies evaluating interventions aiming at reducing the impact of social vulnerability on pregnancy outcomes., OBJECTIVE: To compare pregnancy outcomes between patients that received personalized pregnancy follow-up (PPFU) to address social vulnerability versus standard care., METHODS: Retrospective comparative cohort in a single institution between 2020 and 2021. A total of 3958 women with social vulnerability that delivered a singleton after 14 gestational weeks were included, within which 686 patients had a PPFU. Social vulnerability was defined by the presence of at least one of the following characteristics: social isolation, poor or insecure housing conditions, no work-related household income, and absence of standard health insurance (these four variables were combined as a social deprivation index (SDI)), recent immigration (< 12 month), interpersonal violence during pregnancy, being handicaped or minor, addiction during pregnancy. Maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were compared between patients that received PPFU versus standard care. The associations between poor pregnancy outcomes (premature birth before 37 gestational weeks (GW), premature birth before 34 GW, small for gestational age (SGA) and PPFU were tested using multivariate logistic regression and propensity score matching., RESULTS: After adjustment on SDI, maternal age, parity, body mass index, maternal origin and both high medical and obstetrical risk level before pregnancy, PPFU was an independent protective factor of premature birth before 37 gestational weeks (GW) (aOR = 0.63, 95%CI[0.46-0.86]). The result was similar for premature birth before 34 GW (aOR = 0.53, 95%CI [0.34-0.79]). There was no association between PPFU and SGA (aOR = 1.06, 95%CI [0.86 - 1.30]). Propensity score adjusted (PSa) OR for PPFU using the same variables unveiled similar results, PSaOR = 0.63, 95%CI[0.46-0.86] for premature birth before 37 GW, PSaOR = 0.52, 95%CI [0.34-0.78] for premature birth before 34 GW and PSaOR = 1.07, 95%CI [0.86 - 1.33] for SGA., CONCLUSIONS: This work suggests that PPFU improves pregnancy outcomes and emphasizes that the detection of social vulnerability during pregnancy is a major health issue.

N2  - Quality education can build a sustainable, happier world, but what experiences support student well-being? Numerous laboratory studies suggest that prosocial behavior predicts greater psychological well-being. However, relatively little work has examined whether real-world prosociality programs are associated with greater well-being in primary school-aged children (aged 5-12). In Study 1, we surveyed 24/25 students who completed their 6th Grade curriculum in a long-term care home alongside residents called "Elders," which offered numerous opportunities for planned and spontaneous helping. We found that the meaning that students derived from their prosocial interactions with the Elders was strongly associated with greater psychological well-being. In Study 2, we conducted a pre-registered field experiment with 238 primary school-aged children randomly assigned to package essential items for children who experience homelessness and/or poverty who were either demographically similar or dissimilar in age and/or gender to them as part of a classroom outing. Children self-reported their happiness both pre- and post-intervention. While happiness increased from pre- to post-intervention, this change did not differ for children who helped a similar or dissimilar recipient. These studies offer real-world evidence consistent with the possibility that engaging in prosocial classroom activities-over an afternoon or year-is associated with greater psychological well-being in primary school-aged children.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Permanent supportive housing (PSH) integrates long-term housing and supports for families and individuals experiencing homelessness. Although PSH is frequently provided to families with children, little is known about the impacts of PSH among children. We examined changes in health care visits among children receiving PSH compared with similar children who did not receive PSH., METHODS: We analyzed Pennsylvania Medicaid administrative data for children entering PSH between 2011 and 2016, matching to a comparison cohort with similar demographic and clinical characteristics who received non-PSH housing services. We conducted propensity score-weighted difference-in-differences (DID) analyses to compare changes in health care visits 3 years before and after children entered PSH versus changes in the comparison cohort., RESULTS: We matched 705 children receiving PSH to 3141 in the comparison cohort. Over 3 years following PSH entry, dental visits among children entering PSH increased differentially relative to the comparison cohort (DID: 12.70 visits per 1000 person-months, 95% confidence interval: 3.72 to 21.67). We did not find differential changes in preventive medicine visits, hospitalizations, or emergency department (ED) visits overall. When stratified by age, children <=5 years old at PSH entry experienced a greater decrease in ED visits relative to the comparison cohort (DID: -13.16 visits per 1000 person-months, 95% confidence interval: -26.23 to -0.10). However, emergency visit trends before PSH entry differed between the cohorts., CONCLUSIONS: Children in PSH had relatively greater increases in dental visits, and younger children entering PSH may have experienced relative reductions in ED visits. Policymakers should consider benefits to children when evaluating the overall value of PSH. Copyright © 2023 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The experience of homelessness and child protection involvement pose risks to children's school success. Elucidating processes by which these interrelated systems affect child well-being is important for guiding policy and practice., OBJECTIVE: This study examines the temporal relation between emergency shelter or transitional housing use and child protection involvement among school-aged children. We evaluated effects of both risk indicators on school attendance and school mobility., PARTICIPANT AND SETTING: Using integrated administrative data, we identified 3278 children (ages 4 to 15) whose families used emergency or transitional housing in Hennepin and Ramsey County of Minnesota during the 2014 and 2015 academic years. A propensity-score-matched comparison group of 2613 children who did not use emergency or transitional housing., METHOD: Through a series of logistic regressions and generalized estimating equations, we tested the temporal associations of emergency/transitional housing and child protection involvement as well as how both experiences affected school attendance and mobility., RESULTS: Experiences of emergency or transitional housing often proceeded or occurred concurrently with child protection involvement and increased the likelihood of child protection services. Emergency or transitional housing and child protection involvement posed risks for lower school attendance and greater school mobility., CONCLUSIONS: A multisystem approach to assist families across social services may be important for stabilizing children's housing and bolstering their success at school. A two-generation approach focused on residential and school stability and enhancing family resources could boost adaptive success of family members across contexts. Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of food insecurity and its relationship to diet quality are factors impacting the health of persons living across the United States-affiliated Pacific region (USAP)., OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe characterize the relationship between household food security status and diet quality of 2- to 8-y-old children across jurisdictions in the USAP., METHODS: Baseline data from 2- to 8-y-olds (n = 3099) enrolled in the Children's Healthy Living Program for Remote Underserved Minority Populations in the Pacific region, an obesity prevention study conducted in communities across Alaska, American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Guam, and Hawaii, and a concomitant prevalence study in communities across the Freely Associated States (FAS) (the Federated States of Micronesia: Kosrae, Pohnpei, Chuuk, Yap; Republic of Marshall Islands; Republic of Palau) were collected in 2012. Caregivers self-reported sociodemographic data and food insecurity. Assisted by their caregiver, children completed two dietary records on nonconsecutive, randomly assigned days. The Healthy Eating Index 2005 (HEI-2005) was used to assess the diet quality. Data were summarized overall and by jurisdiction. Differences in HEI-2005 and HEI component scores among jurisdictions and by household food security status were tested using 1-factor ANOVA., RESULTS: Half or more of participants from American Samoa, Guam, CNMI, and FAS reported household food insecurity (n = 295, 59.7%; n = 292, 49.9%; n = 267, 54.6%; n = 572, 69.0%, respectively). HEI-2005 scores varied by jurisdiction (P < 0.001) and were significantly lower among FAS participants (54.7 +/- 1.2) than among all other jurisdictions (P < 0.05). Total diet quality scores did not differ by food security status (59.9 +/- 0.8 food secure compared with 58.3 +/- 1.1 food insecure, P = 0.07); however, most diet quality adequacy component scores were significantly higher and moderation component scores significantly lower among participants in food secure households than those in food insecure households., CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in children's diet quality and household food security existed across USAP jurisdictions.

N2  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a widespread and devastating phenomenon resulting in a myriad of long-term consequences for survivors and their children. IPV victimization not only has negative health and economic consequences, it has also been linked to homelessness and housing instability. In response, the Domestic Violence Housing First (DVHF) model is being used in some domestic violence (DV) agencies to help survivors attain safe and stable housing. The model includes using individualized advocacy and/or flexible funding to help survivors meet these goals. Using a longitudinal, quasi-experimental design, the current study involved conducting interviews with survivors and examining agency records to investigate the effectiveness of this model. We hypothesized that survivors who received DVHF would experience less re-abuse and greater housing stability over 12 months compared to those who received services as usual (SAU). The sample included 345 IPV survivors who had been homeless or unstably housed when they approached one of five DV programs for help. Interviews were spaced 6 months apart (when survivors first sought services as well as 6 months and 12 months later). Longitudinal analyses showed that survivors who received the DVHF model reported greater improvements in housing stability at both the 6-month and 12-month time points compared to those receiving SAU. At the 12-month time point, survivors who had received DVHF reported decreased physical, psychological, and economic abuse, as well as the use of their children against them as a form of abuse. This study adds to a growing body of evidence supporting this model's effectiveness and adds to our understanding of factors impacting the long-term housing stability and safety for IPV survivors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The experience of homelessness and child protection involvement pose risks to children's school success. Elucidating processes by which these interrelated systems affect child well-being is important for guiding policy and practice., OBJECTIVE: This study examines the temporal relation between emergency shelter or transitional housing use and child protection involvement among school-aged children. We evaluated effects of both risk indicators on school attendance and school mobility., PARTICIPANT AND SETTING: Using integrated administrative data, we identified 3278 children (ages 4 to 15) whose families used emergency or transitional housing in Hennepin and Ramsey County of Minnesota during the 2014 and 2015 academic years. A propensity-score-matched comparison group of 2613 children who did not use emergency or transitional housing., METHOD: Through a series of logistic regressions and generalized estimating equations, we tested the temporal associations of emergency/transitional housing and child protection involvement as well as how both experiences affected school attendance and mobility., RESULTS: Experiences of emergency or transitional housing often proceeded or occurred concurrently with child protection involvement and increased the likelihood of child protection services. Emergency or transitional housing and child protection involvement posed risks for lower school attendance and greater school mobility., CONCLUSIONS: A multisystem approach to assist families across social services may be important for stabilizing children's housing and bolstering their success at school. A two-generation approach focused on residential and school stability and enhancing family resources could boost adaptive success of family members across contexts. Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To compare the incidence of inpatient psychiatric admissions and evaluate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among homeless individuals., Methods: This cross-sectional study utilized the Nationwide Inpatient Sample dataset for the year 2016-2017. US adult homeless patients (age >= 18 years) admitted to the hospital were age and sex matched (1:1) with non-homeless individuals using the propensity score matching technique., Results: The study included a total of 614,390 homeless patients (mean age = 46.1 years, 71.9% male). Most of the homeless patients were Black (24.8% vs 17.3% of the non-homeless population). Mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders were highly prevalent in homeless patients compared to those who were non-homeless (P < .001). Composite of psychiatric disorders was also significantly higher in the homeless group (64.9% vs 29.1%, P < .001). Suicidal ideation was present in 19.4% of the homeless individuals and in 2.9% of the non-homeless (P < .001). Hospital admissions related to any psychiatric condition were 33.9% in the homeless and 6.7% in the non-homeless (P < .001). Compared to the non-homeless, homeless patients admitted for psychiatric disorders had longer inpatient psychiatric admissions (8.7 vs 7.7 days, P < .001)., Conclusions: The results revealed a positive association between homelessness, comorbid psychiatric disorders, and suicidal ideations/attempts. Appropriate psychiatric screening measures are needed for the homeless. Homelessness is associated with longer inpatient psychiatric stay. The challenges faced in treating and preventing mental illness in the homeless should be investigated further. © Copyright 2022 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Household food insecurity persists in the United States and has important implications for health and well-being. Food insecurity in female-identified caregivers is particularly concerning, given its association with their mental health and adverse health outcomes for their children. Food insecurity is associated with disordered eating but, to our knowledge, no prior studies have examined an association between food insecurity and food addiction., OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine whether food insecurity is associated with higher food addiction symptom endorsement in low-income female adults., DESIGN: Secondary analysis of baseline data from a quasi-experimental study of a mindfulness-based intervention on gestational weight gain among low-income pregnant individuals and an observational study of low-income families., PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants in study 1 (n = 208) were English-speaking, low-income pregnant individuals with overweight or obesity, recruited in California from 2011 to 2013. Participants in study 2 (n = 181) were English-speaking, low-income female caregivers for children aged 8 through 10 years, recruited in Michigan from 2018 to 2019. Both studies recruited participants from community health clinics, social service agencies, and online advertisements., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was food addiction symptoms, assessed by the Yale Food Addiction Scale., STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Multivariate Poisson regression was used to examine the association between household food insecurity and food addiction symptoms in each sample, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics., RESULTS: In study 1, pregnant individuals in food-insecure households reported 21% higher food addiction symptoms than pregnant individuals in food-secure households (incidence rate ratio 1.21; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.47; P = .047). In study 2, caregivers in food-insecure households had 56% higher food addiction symptoms than caregivers in food-secure households (incidence rate ratio 1.56; 95% CI 1.01 to 2.40; P = .045)., CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary support for a relationship between household food insecurity and food addiction. Future research should examine potential mechanisms and whether interventions to reduce food insecurity lower risk of food addiction. Copyright © 2022 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of engaging unhoused peer ambassadors (PAs) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination efforts to reach people experiencing unsheltered homelessness in Los Angeles County., METHODS: From August to December 2021, vaccinated PAs aged >=18 years who could provide informed consent were recruited during vaccination events for same-day participation. Events were held at encampments, service providers (eg, housing agencies, food lines, and mobile showers), and roving locations around Los Angeles. PAs were asked to join outreach alongside community health workers and shared their experience getting vaccinated, receiving a $25 gift card for each hour they participated. Postevent surveys evaluated how many PAs enrolled and how long they participated. In October 2021, we added a preliminary effectiveness evaluation of how many additional vaccinations were attributable to PAs. Staff who enrolled the PAs estimated the number of additional people vaccinated because of talking with the PA., RESULTS: A total of 117 PAs were enrolled at 103 events, participating for an average of 2 hours. At events with the effectiveness evaluation, 197 additional people were vaccinated over 167 PA hours ($21.19 gift card cost per additional person vaccinated), accounting for >25% of all vaccines given at these events., DISCUSSION: Recruiting same-day unhoused PAs is a feasible, acceptable, and preliminarily effective technique to increase COVID-19 vaccination in unsheltered settings. The findings can inform delivery of other health services for people experiencing homelessness. Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

N2  - AIMS: Homeless mothers with young children in their care contend with high rates of substance use and low self-efficacy. However, a limited number of studies have examined these outcomes associated with housing and supportive services., DESIGN: Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) housing + support services (n = 80), (2) housing-only (n = 80), or (3) services as usual (SAU) (n = 80) and were re-assessed at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months postbaseline., SETTINGS: The study recruited a community-based sample from homeless service agencies and advertisements in a large Midwestern city., PARTICIPANTS: The study recruited two hundred forty (N = 240) women between the ages of 18 to 24 years, experiencing homelessness and with a substance use disorder (SUD) who also had a biological child under the age of 6 years in their care., MEASUREMENTS: We measured frequency of alcohol and drug use using the Form 90 semi-structured interview, and self-efficacy using Pearlin and Schooler's (1978) 7-item Mastery Scale., FINDINGS: Overall, mothers showed significant improvement in substance use and self-efficacy over time in each condition. However, as expected, patterns of change differentiated intervention groups with more mothers showing better substance use and self-efficacy outcomes in housing + supportive services than in SAU. Unexpectedly, more mothers in SAU showed better outcomes than those in housing-only., CONCLUSIONS: Substance use decreased and self-efficacy increased over time, but patterns of change characterized the intervention groups. In particular, findings suggest that when providing housing to this population, supportive services should also be offered. Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Adults experiencing homelessness have much higher rates of alcohol misuse than housed individuals. This study describes the development and preliminary effectiveness of a smartphone-based, just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) to reduce alcohol use among adults experiencing homelessness., METHODS: We conducted a pilot trial (N = 41; mean age [SD] = 45.2 [11.5]; 19.5% women) of the Smart-T Alcohol JITAI where participants completed brief ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) each day, received personalized treatment messages following each EMA, and accessed on-demand intervention content for 4 weeks. The prediction algorithm and treatment messages were developed based on an independent but similar sample as part of the trial. We examined three drinking outcomes: daily drinking (yes/no), drinks per day, and heavy episodic drinking, controlling for scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) at baseline, age, and sex using quadratic growth curve models., RESULTS: Over the 4-week period, participants showed a decline in all alcohol use outcomes. Participants also reported high levels of satisfaction with the JITAI., CONCLUSIONS: Use of the Smart-T Alcohol JITAI was well received and provided encouraging evidence that it may reduce any drinking, drinks per day, and heavy episodic drinking among adults experiencing homelessness.

N2  - Importance: There have been no published randomized clinical trials with a primary outcome of socioeconomic inclusion for young people who have experienced homelessness., Objective: To explore whether young people exiting homelessness who received rent subsidies and adult mentorship experienced more socioeconomic inclusion relative to young people who received only rent subsidies., Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a convergent mixed-methods, unblinded, 2-group, parallel randomized clinical trial with 1:1 allocation embedded within a community-based framework in 3 cities in Ontario, Canada. Participants were enrolled between March 1 and September 30, 2019, and were followed up through March 31, 2022., Interventions: Participants (n = 24) were randomly assigned adult mentors (n = 13) who had been recruited and screened by community partner agencies. All participants received portable rent subsidies (subsidy not tied to a specific location) for 2 years., Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary quantitative outcomes were self-reported measures of community integration (psychological and physical) and self-esteem-proxy indicators of socioeconomic inclusion. Community integration was measured with the Community Integration Scale, with a score range of 1 to 7 for the physical component and 4 to 20 for the psychological component; higher scores indicate higher integration. Self-esteem was measured with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, with a score range of 0 to 30; higher scores indicate greater self-esteem. Secondary quantitative outcomes included social connectedness, hopelessness, and academic and vocational participation. All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle., Results: A total of 24 youths (12 women [50.0%]; mean [SD] age, 21.8 [2.2] years [range, 18-26 years]; race and ethnicity: 10 White [41.7%], 8 Black [33.3%], 2 Asian [8.3%], 2 Indigenous [8.3%], and 2 different choice [8.3%]) transitioned out of homelessness and into market-rent housing. All youths in the group that received mentorship and in the group that did not receive mentorship had stable or nonsignificant improvements in all study outcomes at the primary end point of 18 months compared with baseline (mean [SD] Community Integration Scale psychological score: mentorship group, 11.3 [2.6] at baseline and 11.2 [3.9] at 18 months; no-mentorship group, 10.8 [4.1] at baseline and 13.2 [2.9] at 18 months; mean [SD] Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score: mentorship group, 16.0 [4.6] at baseline and 18.1 [5.2] at 18 months; no-mentorship group, 16.3 [6.1] at baseline and 19.6 [5.7] at 18 months). However, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the Community Integration Scale psychological score (adjusted mean difference, -2.0; 95% CI, -5.0 to 1.0; P = .18) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score (adjusted mean difference, -1.4; 95% CI, -5.0 to 2.3; P = .44) 18 months after randomization. Ancillary analysis suggested that youths with informal mentors (mentors outside the study) at baseline felt more psychologically integrated at 18 months relative to those with no informal mentors at baseline (adjusted mean difference, 3.6; 95% CI, 0.4-6.8; P = .03)., Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions made it challenging for mentors and mentees to connect, which may have affected the findings. Steady socioeconomic outcomes-potentially attributable to portable rent subsidies-are noteworthy, given the socioeconomic inequities this population has faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The possible benefit of informal mentorship warrants further investigation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Women comprise around 15% of admissions to provincial correctional institutions in Canada. Women in custody are known to have a high prevalence of mental health concerns, but little is known about how those referred to mental health services compare with referred men at a similar stage of imprisonment., AIMS: Our aim was to describe and compare clinical, social and demographic characteristics of a complete cohort of custodially remanded men and women who were referred to mental health services while under custodial remand in two correctional institutions., METHODS: We carried out retrospective analysis of data obtained from 4040 men and 1734 provincially detained women referred to mental health services in two correctional centres holding mainly pre-trial prisoners and serving a large mixed urban-rural catchment area in Toronto, Canada over a nearly five-year period. Men and women were first screened using the Brief Jail Mental Health Screen. Those who screened positive were assessed using the Jail Screening Assessment Tool the Brief Psychopathology Rating Scale-Expanded (BPRS-E) and the Clinical Global Impression-Corrections (CGI-C)., RESULTS: There were many similarities between men and women, but also some important differences. Women were more socioeconomically disadvantaged than men. More women than men reported having children, yet fewer reported having any form of employment or social supports, although men were more likely to report unstable housing. In addition, women were significantly more likely to have mood and anxiety problems and to be self-harming, but did not differ from men in current psychotic symptoms. We also found differences in patterns of substance use, with a higher proportion of women using heroin and methamphetamines but fewer women having accessed addiction services., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have implications for clinicians and service planners. They underscore the value of systematic screening for identifying need. More specifically, they suggest need for increased availability of addiction services for women as well as ensuring support for those women who have dependent-age children. Improvement in supports for entry into employment is particularly needed for women, while men are particularly likely to need access to stable housing. Copyright © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Emergency shelters are a core component of homeless service systems that address immediate basic needs. Service bans, which refer to temporary or permanent disallowances from a program or organization, are an underresearched phenomenon that can leave people experiencing homelessness without needed supports. This exploratory study examined the factors associated with shelter bans among people experiencing homelessness using secondary data from two Canadian studies: (1) a multisite randomized controlled trial of Housing First (At Home/Chez Soi Demonstration Project) and (2) a cross-sectional survey of youth experiencing homelessness across Canada (2019 Without a Home-National Youth Homelessness Survey). The two datasets were analyzed separately using logistic regression models with similar predictors to maximize the comparability of the results. Participants who experienced homelessness at an earlier age and had recent criminal justice system involvement were more likely to have shelter bans in both datasets. Impaired impulse control, more chronic medical conditions and living in Toronto were associated with increased likelihood of shelter bans in the At Home/Chez Soi dataset, whereas more adverse childhood experiences, physical violence victimization, engagement in survival sex behaviours and longer current episodes of homelessness were significant predictors of bans in the Without A Home dataset. Overall, the findings suggest that victimization and criminalization during homelessness may increase the risk of shelter loss from bans and further exclusion. The observed regional differences also highlight the potential limits of individual-level predictors. Further research is needed on shelter ban outcomes, as well as how capacity limits and organizational policies affect banning decisions. Copyright © 2022. The New York Academy of Medicine.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Inadequate housing contributes to the risk of family separation in nearly one-quarter of child maltreatment investigations. Child welfare struggles to identify and address the demand for housing assistance. A range of housing interventions shows promise for stabilizing families. Still, aid remains difficult to access, and little evidence exists for prioritizing households to interventions. Inefficient decisions about who to serve with scarce housing resources threaten to diminish resources and unintentionally place children at greater risk., OBJECTIVE: The present study leverages computational modeling to simulate the complex dynamics of coordinated child welfare response to inadequate housing. Simulations address the lack of microdata on current service delivery to inform policy-making that protects children from family insecurity., PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGS: A series of simulated policy experiments test strategies for maximizing access to appropriate housing assistance and minimizing system-wide family separations using US estimates of housing insecurity and child welfare involvement. Models incorporate the feedback loops involved in seeking and waiting for needed services, using information on national rates of housing insecurity among child welfare-involved families., RESULTS: Results demonstrate population-level improvements in family stability from enhanced targeting of housing assistance to families most likely to benefit, plus expanded access to housing interventions. Neither improved screening procedures nor more housing supports alone improve child welfare outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: Findings emphasize the importance of data-driven upstream policies for protecting inadequately housed children at risk of maltreatment.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The burden associated with schizophrenia is substantial. Impacts on the individual, healthcare system, and society may be particularly striking within the veteran population due to the presence of physical and mental health comorbidities. Disease burden is also influenced by a complex interplay between social determinants of health and health disparities. The objective of the current study was to compare non-healthcare societal outcomes between veterans with and without schizophrenia in the United States Veterans Health Administration (VHA)., METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the VHA database (01/2013-09/2019; study period). Veterans with schizophrenia (>=2 diagnoses of ICD-9295.xx, ICD-10 F20.x, F21, and/or F25.x during the study period) were identified; the index date was the earliest observed schizophrenia diagnosis. Veterans with schizophrenia were propensity score-matched to those without schizophrenia using baseline characteristics. A 12-month baseline and variable follow-up period were applied. The frequency of unemployment, divorce, incarceration, premature death, and homelessness were compared between the matched cohorts using standardized mean difference (SMD). Risk of unemployment and homelessness were estimated using logistic regression models., RESULTS: A total of 102,207 veterans remained in each cohort after matching (91% male; 61% White [per AMA]; median age, 59 years). Among veterans with schizophrenia, 42% had a substance use disorder and 30% had mental health-related comorbidities, compared with 25 and 15%, respectively, of veterans without schizophrenia. Veterans with schizophrenia were more likely to experience unemployment (69% vs. 41%; SMD: 0.81), divorce (35% vs. 28%; SMD: 0.67), homelessness (28% vs. 7%; SMD: 0.57), incarceration (0.4% vs. 0.1%; SMD: 0.47), and premature death (14% vs. 12%; SMD < 0.1) than veterans without schizophrenia. After further adjustments, the risk of unemployment and of homelessness were 5.4 and 4.5 times higher among veterans with versus without schizophrenia. Other predictors of unemployment included Black [per AMA] race and history of substance use disorder; for homelessness, younger age (18-34 years) and history of mental health-related comorbidities were additional predictors., CONCLUSION: A greater likelihood of adverse societal outcomes was observed among veterans with versus without schizophrenia. Given their elevated risk for unemployment and homelessness, veterans with schizophrenia should be a focus of targeted, multifactorial interventions to reduce disease burden. Copyright © 2022.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Research exploring associations between exposure to social determinants of health and breastfeeding is needed to identify breastfeeding barriers. Housing insecurity and household conditions (chaos and crowding) may affect breastfeeding by increasing maternal stress and discomfort and decreasing time available to breastfeed., RESEARCH AIM: We aimed to examine the relationships between housing insecurity, breastfeeding exclusivity intention during the early postnatal period, and breastfeeding exclusivity at 6 months postpartum among a sample "at risk" for suboptimal breastfeeding rates., METHODS: This study is a secondary data analysis of a longitudinal study at two time periods. Data were collected from English- and Spanish-speaking, Medicaid-eligible mother-infant dyads (N = 361) at near-birth and child aged 6 months, in New York City and Pittsburgh. Structural equation modeling was used to examine direct and indirect effects of housing insecurity on breastfeeding exclusivity at child aged 6 months., RESULTS: The path model showed that experiencing more markers of housing insecurity (i.e., foreclosure/eviction threat, history of homelessness, late rent) was predictive of significantly lower breastfeeding exclusivity at 6 months. This was partially mediated through less exclusive breastfeeding intention during the early postnatal period. Greater household crowding was associated with 6-month breastfeeding exclusivity when mediated by intention. Household crowding had differential effects by study site and participant race/ethnicity., CONCLUSION: Refinement of housing insecurity as a multi-dimensional construct can lead to the development of standardized data collection instruments, inform future methodological decisions in research addressing social determinants of health, and can inform the development of responsive individual- and structural-level interventions. The data used in this study were collected as part of the SMART Beginnings Randomized Controlled Trial (NCT02459327 registered at ClinicalTrials.gov).

N2  - This study assessed the acceptability of porridge from a corn-common bean flour blend to increase the diversity of complementary foods in Malawi. Porridges prepared using commercial corn-soybean flour (C-CSB), homemade orange corn-soybean flour (H-CSB), and orange corn-common bean flour (CCBB) were evaluated by 101 pairs of mothers and their respective children aged from 6 to 24 months. A home use test (HUT) setup was used in this study, and the flours were given sequentially to participating households following a randomized complete block design. Each sample type was evaluated for 3 days in a row followed by a 1-day break (washout period) between sample types. Based on aggregate mean scores, all the samples were liked by both the children and their mothers. However, clustering results revealed two distinct consumer segments for mothers as well as for children. Most of the mothers (59.4% in cluster 1) liked all the samples, while the minority (cluster 2) were neutral (neither like nor dislike) regarding the H-CSB porridge. Likewise, most children (66.3% in cluster 2) liked all the samples, while the rest in cluster 1 did not like CCBB porridge. Infants (<=12 months) and those from food-insecure households, respectively, were 5.42 and 6.75 times more likely to like the CCBB porridge than their counterparts. The study has demonstrated the potential of introducing CCBB complementary porridge in Malawi and possibly in other countries with similar food preferences and socioeconomic stature. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The study provides a solution to the limited diversity of complementary foods in sub-Saharan Africa and Malawi in particular. The findings can help food scientists, nutritionists, marketers, and policymakers develop strategies for promoting the consumption of orange corn-common bean porridge. Furthermore, the findings can inform decisions on commercializing orange corn-common bean flour by flour processors. Copyright © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists R.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Social networks may play positive and negative roles in the lives of young adults experiencing homelessness (YEH) who are transitioning into housing. Social networks can influence their alcohol and/or other drug (AOD) use, as well as provide immediate and long-term support necessary for a successful transition., METHODS: We adapted a four-session computer-assisted motivational interviewing social network intervention (MI-SNI) for YEH transitioning into housing. We iteratively adapted and beta tested the intervention for delivery by case managers at an organization that provides supportive housing to YEH. We conducted a focus group with agency staff (n = 6), role-play exercises with case managers (n = 3), and semi-structured interviews with residents (n = 6). Interview data were thematically analyzed with open coding. This study presents the first adaptation of an innovative social network-based motivational intervention to reduce AOD use and increase stable, prosocial supportive connections via visualizations of the structure and composition of the individual's social network., RESULTS: Participants rated sessions as "moderately" to "very" helpful and "good" quality on average. Participants agreed that the sessions were helpful, understandable, and satisfying and would work for new residents. Themes emerged in four broad categories: (1) Acceptability, (2) Positive benefits, (3) Visualization reactions, and (4) MI-SNI interface reactions. For the acceptability category, three sub-themes emerged: (1) understandability, (2) enjoyability and ease of use, (3) and barriers to acceptability. Five sub-themes emerged about the intervention's likelihood to trigger positive benefits: (1) learning/new insights, (2) enhancement to motivation to change, (3) making AOD changes, (4) building social support, and (5) the intervention's usefulness to some but not others. Five sub-themes also emerged from comments about the social network visualizations: (1) general positive comments, (2) understandability, (3) new insights, (4) triggering changes in social support, and (5) triggering changes in AOD use. When discussing the MI-SNI intervention interface beyond the visualizations, discussions emerged in three thematic categories: (1) discussion of name listing, (2) discussion of screen wording, and (3) the use of a computer interface to deliver the intervention., CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the MI-SNI is acceptable to YEH and can be feasibly delivered by case managers during case management sessions.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a brief intervention to promote responsible substance use and safe sex behaviors in youths experiencing homelessness (YEH)., METHODS: Design: A Solomon four-group (double randomized controlled trial) longitudinal design with repeated measures (3- and 6-month follow-ups) was used in drop-in centers for YEH in Austin, Texas and Columbus, Ohio from which 602 youths, 18-24 years-old (M = 21 +/- 1.8), 50% white; 69.9% heterosexual were recruited. A manualized one-on-one intervention consisted of six modules delivered via laptop computers. Modules focused on communication, goal-setting, substance use refusal, safe sex behaviors, enhanced psychological capital (hope, optimism, resilience, self-efficacy, gratitude), and life satisfaction. Valid and reliable measures of hope, optimism, future time perspective, resilience, social connectedness, gratitude, condom intention, self-efficacy for safe sex, safe sex behaviors, self-efficacy for substance use refusal, and life satisfaction were used to collect data for which three hypotheses were tested, using intent to treat, with multi-level modeling (R)., RESULTS: The analysis showed partial support for all hypotheses: (1) post-test outcomes were greater than pretests; (2) intervention group outcomes were greater than control group measures; and (3) significant effects for pretesting. YEH in Ohio completed significantly more sessions than YEH in Texas (p = .001), but took significantly longer to complete all six sessions (p = .001)., DISCUSSION: This brief intervention had significant effects on YEH to promote healthy attitudes and behaviors that merit further testing in larger samples.

N2  - Background: This proof-of-concept trial examined a 6-month Prevention Plus (PP) intervention implemented in a federally qualified health center on child standardized BMI (ZBMI), using a planned clinical effect threshold of -0.16 ZBMI. The relationship between food security status and PP delivered with caregiver goals (PP+) and without caregiver goals (PP-) on energy balance behaviors (i.e., fruits and vegetables, physical activity) and child ZBMI was explored. Methods: Seventy-three, underserved children, 4-10 years of age with a BMI >=85th percentile, were randomized to one of two interventions, PP+ and PP-, both providing 2.5 hours of contact time, implemented in five clinics by behavioral health consultants (BHCs). Outcomes were child anthropometrics (included 9-month follow-up), implementation data collected from electronic health records, and caregiver and BHC evaluations. Results: Children were 57.5% female and 78.1% Hispanic, with 32.9% from food-insecure households and 58.9% from households with an annual income of less than $20,000. Child ZBMI significantly (p < 0.05) decreased at 6 and 9 months (-0.08 +/- 0.24 and -0.12 +/- 0.43), with only PP+ reaching the clinical threshold at 9 months (PP+: -0.20 +/- 0.42 vs. PP-: -0.05 +/- 0.42). Sixty-four percent of families attended >=50% of the sessions, and BHCs delivered 78.5% +/- 23.5% of components at attended sessions. Caregivers were satisfied with the intervention and BHCs found the intervention helpful/useful. No relationship with food insecurity status and outcomes was found. Conclusions: PP+ when delivered by a primary care provider to underserved families showed promise for producing a clinically meaningful effect. Families and providers felt the intervention was a viable treatment option.

This study examined if home food environment, dietary quality, energy intake, and body weight changes during adolescent obesity treatment differed by food security status, and if changes in the home food environment were associated with changes in dietary quality and energy intake by food security status. Adolescents (n = 82; 13.7 +/- 1.2 years) with obesity participated in a 4-month BWL treatment. Food insecurity, home food environment (Home Food Inventory [HFI]), dietary quality (Healthy Eating Index [HEI]), energy intake, and body mass index (BMI) were assessed at baseline and post-treatment. A reduced obesogenic home food environment and improved dietary quality were observed for food secure (ps < 0.01), but not insecure households (ps > 0.05) (mean difference, HFI: -6.6 +/- 6.4 vs. -2.4 +/- 7.4; HEI: 5.1 +/- 14.4 vs. 2.7 +/- 17.7). Energy intake and BMI decreased for adolescents in food secure and insecure households (ps < 0.03) (mean difference; energy intake: -287 +/- 417 vs. -309 +/- 434 kcal/day; BMI: -1.0 +/- 1.4 vs. -0.7 +/- 1.4). BWL yielded similar reductions in energy intake and body weight yet did not offer the same benefits for improved dietary quality and the home food environment for adolescents with food insecurity.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The experience of homelessness for young people can affect social, emotional, and physical development, resulting in poorer physical and mental health outcomes. To reduce rates of youth homelessness, a better understanding of both risk and resilience is needed to inform future intervention development. This article presents a systematic review of published research reporting risk or resilience factors related to homelessness among young people in Western countries., METHODS: After thorough examination for inclusion criteria, 665 abstracts of peer-reviewed quantitative studies of risk or resilience factors for homelessness among young people (ages 0-25) that included an adequate comparison group (e.g., not homeless) were selected. After abstract and full-text screening, 16 articles were reviewed. A primary prevention framework was used to create an explanatory model for the onset of homelessness using risk and resilience factors., RESULTS: Common risk factors for youth homelessness included difficulties with family, mental health or substance use problems, a history of problem behaviors, a history of foster care, homelessness as a child, and running away. Common protective factors included a supportive family, a college education, and high socioeconomic status. Findings were integrated into a provisional developmental model of youth homelessness risk. Clinical implications of the model for service development are discussed, and a model for monitoring homelessness risk and resilience factors is proposed., CONCLUSIONS: Factors affecting homelessness risk among youths and adults differ, with family, foster care, and schooling playing a much more important role among youths. Findings highlight opportunities for youth homelessness prevention strategies and monitoring.

N2  - Importance: Socioeconomic factors are associated with the prevalence of depression, but their associations with prognosis are unknown. Understanding this association would aid in the clinical management of depression., Objective: To determine whether employment status, financial strain, housing status, and educational attainment inform prognosis for adults treated for depression in primary care, independent of treatment and after accounting for clinical prognostic factors., Data Sources: The Embase, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane (CENTRAL) databases were searched from database inception to October 8, 2021., Study Selection: Inclusion criteria were as follows: randomized clinical trials that used the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R; the most common comprehensive screening and diagnostic measure of depressive and anxiety symptoms in primary care randomized clinical trials), measured socioeconomic factors at baseline, and sampled patients with unipolar depression who sought treatment for depression from general physicians/practitioners or who scored 12 or more points on the CIS-R. Exclusion criteria included patients with depression secondary to a personality or psychotic disorder or neurologic condition, studies of bipolar or psychotic depression, studies that included children or adolescents, and feasibility studies. Studies were independently assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria by 2 reviewers., Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were extracted and cleaned by data managers for each included study, further cleaned by multiple reviewers, and cross-checked by study chief investigators. Risk of bias and quality were assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tools, respectively. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses-Individual Participant Data (PRISMA-IPD) reporting guidelines., Main Outcomes and Measures: Depressive symptoms at 3 to 4 months after baseline., Results: This systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis identified 9 eligible studies that provided individual patient data for 4864 patients (mean [SD] age, 42.5 (14.0) years; 3279 women [67.4%]). The 2-stage random-effects meta-analysis end point depressive symptom scale scores were 28% (95% CI, 20%-36%) higher for unemployed patients than for employed patients and 18% (95% CI, 6%-30%) lower for patients who were homeowners than for patients living with family or friends, in hostels, or homeless, which were equivalent to 4.2 points (95% CI, 3.6-6.2 points) and 2.9 points (95% CI, 1.1-4.9 points) on the Beck Depression Inventory II, respectively. Financial strain and educational attainment were associated with prognosis independent of treatment, but unlike employment and housing status, there was little evidence of associations after adjusting for clinical prognostic factors., Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that unemployment was associated with a poor prognosis whereas home ownership was associated with improved prognosis. These differences were clinically important and independent of the type of treatment received. Interventions that address employment or housing difficulties could improve outcomes for patients with depression.

N2  - My Strengths Training for Life TM (MST4Life TM) is a positive youth development program for improving wellbeing and social inclusion in young people experiencing homelessness. MST4Life TM addresses a gap in strengths-based programs aimed at promoting healthy and optimal development in vulnerable older adolescents/emerging adults. The program was co-developed with a UK housing service as part of a long-term (>8 years) community-academic partnership. This mixed-methods study describes a key step in developing and evaluating the program: exploring its feasibility and acceptability with 15 homeless young people (Mean age = 19.99 years, SD = 2.42; 60% male, 40% female). Participants experienced 8 weekly sessions within their local community, followed by a 4-day/3-night residential outdoor adventure trip. In addition to their attendance records, the viewpoints of the participants and their support workers were obtained using diary rooms and focus groups. Feasibility was indicated via the themes of attendance, engagement, and reaction. The findings suggested that young people enjoyed and perceived a need for the program, that they considered the program and its evaluation methods to be acceptable, and that both the community-based and outdoor adventure residential phases could be implemented as planned. Minor modifications are needed to recruitment strategies before it is more widely rolled out and evaluated.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is a paucity of data on outcomes of opioid use disorder (OUD) from low- and middle-income countries. We aimed to investigate the mortality as well as negative social and health outcomes in a 6-year follow-up study of a cohort of individuals with opioid use, including those with OUD, in Iran., DESIGN AND SETTING: Participants with opioid use initially interviewed in late 2011 in the Iranian National Mental Health Survey (IranMHS)-a household survey of 15-64-year-old population-were followed-up in early 2018., PARTICIPANTS: All respondents (n = 236) who had reported use of any opioids at least five times during the 12-month period prior to the index interview were included in the study., MEASUREMENTS: Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) version 2.1 was used for assessment of opioid use and OUD at baseline. Vital status in the follow-up was ascertained through contact with participants/informants, primarily via telephone calls and also through the death registration systems. Weighted incidence rates of negative consequences of opioid use (e.g. incarceration, suicide attempts, violent behavior) were estimated for those who were interviewed., FINDINGS: Seven (3.3%) of the 236 participants with opioid use including four (3.1%) of the 136 with OUD had died by the time of the follow-up interview, resulting in death rates of 0.49 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.21-1.38] and 0.53 (95% CI = 0.16-2.62) per 100 person-years, respectively. Overall, 35.0% of participants with opioid use and 44.0% of those with OUD among the 145 individuals interviewed at follow-up experienced non-fatal serious adverse outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: In Iran, opioid use and opioid use disorder are associated with increased mortality and other adverse outcomes.

N2  - Illicit drug use and cognitive distortions confer significant risks to youth suicidal thoughts and behaviors. However, there has been limited evidence regarding the efficacy of suicide prevention interventions with homeless youth, especially studies testing whether such interventions can reduce the risk for suicidal ideation associated with illicit drug use. Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) between the ages of 18 to 24 years were recruited from a drop-in center. Youth were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Youth reported their illicit drug use, cognitive distortions, and suicidal ideation 4 times over 9 months. A multiple-group multilevel structural equation model showed that higher illicit drug use at baseline predicted a slower reduction in cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation in the TAU group. These associations were not found in the CTSP + TAU group, suggesting an interruption of such risk from illicit drug use. Findings suggest that CTSP can reduce the risk of illicit drug use as a treatment barrier towards cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation among homeless youth, with implications to improve treatment efforts and to reduce premature mortality in a vulnerable population.

N2  - Access to appropriate health and social care is challenging for vulnerable populations. We used a 'pop-up' delivery model to bring community-based services in contact with communities with poor access to health and social care. Our aim was to examine whether pop-up events improve access to essential health and social support services for selected vulnerable communities and increase collaboration between community-based health and social services. Set in south-eastern Melbourne, two pop-up events were held, one with people at risk of homelessness attending a community lunch and the other with South Sudanese women helping at-risk youth. Providers represented 20 dental, housing, justice, employment and mental health services. We made structured observations of each event and held semi-structured interviews with consumers and providers. Pre-post surveys of managers assessed acceptability and perceived impact. We reached 100 community participants who had multiple needs, particularly for dentistry. Following the events, participants reported increased knowledge of services and access pathways, community members spoke of increased trust and partnerships between service providers were fostered. The pop-up model can increase provider collaboration and provide new options for vulnerable populations to access needed services. 'Bringing the service to the person' is a compelling alternative to asking consumers to negotiate complex access pathways.

N2  - This systematic review assessed peer-reviewed research studies on mortality rates of the homeless population within the United States. Extrapolated data included definitions of homelessness, mortality data sources, findings on mortality rates, and causes of premature mortality. Results demonstrate that individuals experiencing homelessness die earlier than comparison groups not experiencing homelessness. Methodology and findings varied across studies. Subpopulations included veterans, families, youth, and unsheltered. Causes of death varied across subpopulations and changed over time. Top causes of death, predominantly determined by ICD codes, stemmed from neoplasms, heart disease, and substance use disorder. Sources used for mortality data included the National Death Index (NDI), the Social Security Death Index (SSDI), state death occurrence files, and city vital statistics. Important research foci include standardization, subpopulation variations, policy implications, and the influence of mortality risk factors, such as poverty and racism.

N2  - In 2019-2020 we conducted a pilot study of a Nurse Practitioner clinic working with housing insecure children (0-18 years) that found high levels of developmental delay, missed immunizations and dental caries. This present non-randomized, concurrent mixed-methods study protocol explains the next phase of the research designed proving proof of concept for a Nurse Practitioner model of care for these vulnerable children. Focusing on identifying and understanding clinic admission processes, tracking referral pathways and uptake, and how many vulnerable children miss potential care and why. This will help us to understand and address gaps in health service delivery for this cohort., DESIGN: The study uses a concurrent mixed- method design where both qualitative and quantitative data are collected during the same period (between January 2021 and March 2022 as per the funding timeline)., METHODS: The concurrent mixed-method design will collect data from: A comprehensive assessment tool used by the Nurse Practitioner to evaluate the child accessing specialist homeless services, which assess their mental, physical and social health needs. Documentation about the child's referral needs and uptake by disadvantage families. Interviews with housing insecure families, and staff/managers of the specialist homeless service. A review of Nurse Practitioner case notes. Surveys of families with children accessing the Nurse Practitioner service., DISCUSSION: Addressing the childhood impacts of family homelessness is of global importance. Structural equation modelling, from the surveys and in-depth health assessments along with the thematic analysis of the interviews with parents and staff/managers provide an understanding of the relationships between referral uptake and variables such as education, homelessness and transport accessibility. Investigating the enablers and barriers to the usual health access and our extended referral uptake impacted by family homelessness enables a better understanding of the current health gaps., IMPACT: Just over one fifth of Australian children live with their families in some form of housing instability including homelessness. These children, aged from birth to 18 years, are often disconnected from health and similar social institutions, making them an underserviced population. Our research investigates a Nurse Practitioner services that helps reconnect children with services to help avoid poor long-term health outcomes. Copyright © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - HIV researchers use short messaging service (SMS)-based surveys to monitor health behaviors more closely than what would be possible with in-person assessment. Benefits are tempered by nonresponse to completing surveys. Understanding response patterns and their associated study participant characteristics would guide more tailored use of SMS-based surveys for HIV studies. We examined response to weekly 7-item SMS surveys administered as part of an HIV prevention trial. Using Mixture hidden Markov models (MHMM), we identified the underlying response patterns shared by subgroups of participants over time and quantified the association between these response patterns and participant characteristics. Three underlying response patterns were identified; responders, responders with phone-related errors, and non-responders. Non-responders versus responders were more likely to be younger, male, cis-gender, Black and Latinx participants with histories of homelessness, incarceration, and social support service utilization. Responders with phone-related errors compared to non-responders were more likely to be Black, Latinx, female, students, and have a history of incarceration and social support service utilization. More nuanced results from MHMM analyses better inform what strategies to use for increasing SMS response rates, including assisting in securing phone ownership/service for responders with phone-related errors and identifying alternative strategies for non-responders. Actively collecting and monitoring non-delivery notification data available from SMS gateway service companies offers another opportunity to identify and connect with participants when they are willing but unable to respond during follow-up.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study provides information on COVID-19 vaccination and attitudes among young adults with recent experiences of homelessness., METHODS: Participants (n = 134) from a clinical trial of a risk reduction program for youth experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles completed survey items about COVID-19 vaccinations between March and October 2021., RESULTS: A total of 29% of respondents were vaccinated, and 50% were not interested in getting vaccinated. Among the unvaccinated, 58% had not been offered the vaccine; furthermore, 38%-45% had strong distrust of the vaccine and were worried about its harmfulness. Vaccination status was generally unrelated to demographics, housing instability, service use, substance use, or mental health., DISCUSSION: Our data suggest that vaccination rates are lower among young adults with recent experiences of homelessness than those in the general US population. The results suggest a need for greater direct outreach that includes both offering the vaccine and addressing misconceptions about its safety to increase vaccination rates in this population.

N2  - Adequate dietary diversity among infants is often suboptimal in developing countries. We assessed the impact of nutrition counselling using a digital job aid on dietary diversity of children aged 6-23 months using data from a cluster randomised controlled trial in Bangladesh. The trial had five arms, each with 25 clusters. The four intervention arms provided counselling using a digital job aid and different prenatal and post-natal combinations of lipid-based supplements and the comparison arm with usual practice. We enrolled 1500 pregnant women and followed them until the children reached their second birthday. We developed a tablet-based system for intervention delivery, data collection and project supervision. We combined the four intervention arms (n = 855), in which community health workers (CHWs) provided age-appropriate complementary feeding counselling, to compare against the comparison arm (n = 403). We calculated the outcome indicators from the children's 24-h dietary recalls. Overall, the intervention increased the mean dietary diversity score by 0.09 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.2-0.16) and odds of minimum dietary diversity by 18% (95% CI: 0.99-1.40). However, there was a significant interaction on the effect of the intervention on dietary diversity by age. The mean dietary diversity score was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.11-0.37) higher in the intervention than in the comparison arm at 9 months and 0.14 (95% CI: 0.01-27) at 12 months of age. The intervention effect was non-significant at an older age. Overall, consumption of flesh food was 1.32 times higher in the intervention arm (odds ratio [OR] 1.32, 95% CI: 1.11-1.57) in 6-23 months of age. The intervention significantly improved child dietary diversity score in households with mild and moderate food insecurity by 0.27 (95% CI: 0.06-0.49) and 0.16 (0.05-27), respectively, but not with food-secure and severely food-insecure households. Although the study did not evaluate the impact of digital job aid alone, the findings indicate the utility of nutrition counselling by CHWs using a digital job aid to improve child feeding practices in broader programmes.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Cigarette smoking and associated high-risk behaviors are prevalent among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH), making appropriately tailored interventions targeting smoking behavior important for this group. We pilot tested a brief text-messaging intervention (TMI) as an adjunct to standard care for YEH who smoke and found promising preliminary effects of the intervention on smoking cessation. The purpose of the present study was to test the TMI's effect on the secondary outcomes of other substance use (including use of other tobacco/nicotine devices) and mental health symptoms., METHODS: A total of 77 participants completed the pilot randomized controlled trial, with 40 receiving the TMI (174 automated text messages plus a group smoking counseling session and provision of nicotine patches). They completed an assessment at baseline and another three months later that evaluated use of other tobacco/nicotine devices, alcohol, marijuana, and anxiety and depression symptoms., RESULTS: We found that the TMI helped to reduce secondary substance use behaviors and mental health symptoms among the participants; mainly there were medium effects of the intervention on changes in other tobacco/nicotine use, drinking, and anxiety and depression symptoms. The intervention did not have an effect on number of marijuana use days in the past month; however, past 30-day marijuana users who received the intervention benefited by reducing the number of times they used marijuana per day., CONCLUSIONS: In addition to helping reduce cigarette smoking, we found that a TMI for YEH was helpful in improving secondary outcomes, suggesting the promise of the TMI on benefiting YEH even beyond targeted smoking behavior., IMPLICATIONS: This pilot study demonstrates that by targeting cigarette smoking using a text message-based intervention among youth experiencing homelessness, effects may be seen in other areas of functioning such as other substance use and mental health., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03874585.

N2  - Importance: Women and families constitute the fastest-growing segments of the homeless population. However, there is limited evidence on whether women experiencing homelessness have poorer childbirth delivery outcomes and higher costs of care compared with women not experiencing homelessness., Objective: To compare childbirth delivery outcomes and costs of care between pregnant women experiencing homelessness vs those not experiencing homelessness., Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included 15029 pregnant women experiencing homelessness and 308242 pregnant women not experiencing homelessness who had a delivery hospitalization in 2014. The study used statewide databases that included all hospital admissions in 3 states (ie, Florida, Massachusetts, and New York). Delivery outcomes and delivery-associated costs were compared between pregnant women experiencing homelessness and those not experiencing homelessness cared for at the same hospital (analyzed using the overlap propensity-score weighting method and multivariable regression models with hospital fixed effects). The Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate procedure was used to account for multiple comparisons. Data were analyzed from January 2020 through May 2020., Exposure: Housing status at delivery hospitalization., Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcome variables included obstetric complications (ie, antepartum hemorrhage, placental abnormalities, premature rupture of the membranes, preterm labor, and postpartum hemorrhage), neonatal complications (ie, fetal distress, fetal growth restriction, and stillbirth), delivery method (ie, cesarean delivery), and delivery-associated costs., Results: Among 15029 pregnant women experiencing homelessness (mean [SD] age, 28.5 [5.9] years) compared with 308242 pregnant women not experiencing homelessness (mean [SD] age, 29.4 [5.8] years) within the same hospital, those experiencing homelessness were more likely to experience preterm labor (adjusted probability, 10.5% vs 6.7%; adjusted risk difference [aRD], 3.8%; 95% CI, 1.2%-6.5%; adjusted P = .03) and had higher delivery-associated costs (adjusted costs, $6306 vs $5888; aRD, $417; 95% CI, $156-$680; adjusted P = .02) compared with women not experiencing homelessness. Those experiencing homelessness also had a higher probability of placental abnormalities (adjusted probability, 4.0% vs 2.0%; aRD, 1.9%; 95% CI, 0.4%-3.5%; adjusted P = .053), although this difference was not statistically significant., Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that women experiencing homelessness, compared with those not experiencing homelessness, who had a delivery and were admitted to the same hospital were more likely to experience preterm labor and incurred higher delivery-associated costs. These findings suggest wide disparities in delivery-associated outcomes between women experiencing homelessness and those not experiencing homelessness in the US. The findings highlight the importance for health care professionals to actively screen pregnant women for homelessness during prenatal care visits and coordinate their care with community health programs and social housing programs to make sure their health care needs are met.

N2  - AIM: To assess the effectiveness of supported employment interventions for improving competitive employment in populations of people with conditions other than only severe mental illness., BACKGROUND: Supported employment interventions have been extensively tested in severe mental illness populations. These approaches may be beneficial outside of these populations., METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Scopus, JSTOR, PEDro, OTSeeker, and NIOSHTIC for trials including unemployed people with any condition and including severe mental illness if combined with other co-morbidities or other specific circumstances (e.g., homelessness). We excluded trials where inclusion was based on severe mental illness alone. Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias (RoB v2.0) and four reviewers extracted data. We assessed rates of competitive employment as compared to traditional vocational rehabilitation or waiting list/services as usual., FINDINGS: Ten randomised controlled trials (913 participants) were included. Supported employment was more effective than control interventions for improving competitive employment in seven trials: in people with affective disorders [risk ratio (RR) 10.61 (1.49, 75.38)]; mental disorders and justice involvement [RR 4.44 (1.36,14.46)]; veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [RR 2.73 (1.64, 4.54)]; formerly incarcerated veterans [RR 2.17 (1.09, 4.33)]; people receiving methadone treatment [RR 11.5 (1.62, 81.8)]; veterans with spinal cord injury at 12 months [RR 2.46 (1.16, 5.22)] and at 24 months [RR 2.81 (1.98, 7.37)]; and young people not in employment, education, or training [RR 5.90 (1.91-18.19)]. Three trials did not show significant benefits from supported employment: populations of workers with musculoskeletal injuries [RR 1.38 (1.00, 1.89)]; substance abuse [RR 1.85 (0.65, 5.41)]; and formerly homeless people with mental illness [RR 1.55 (0.76, 3.15)]. Supported employment interventions may be beneficial to people from more diverse populations than those with severe mental illness alone. Defining competitive employment and increasing (and standardising) measurement of non-vocational outcomes may help to improve research in this area.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) are at elevated risk of HIV/AIDS and disproportionately identify as racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minorities. We developed a new peer change agent (PCA) HIV prevention intervention with 3 arms: (1) an arm using an artificial intelligence (AI) planning algorithm to select PCAs; (2) a popularity arm, the standard PCA approach, operationalized as highest degree centrality (DC); and (3) an observation-only comparison group., SETTING: A total of 713 YEH were recruited from 3 drop-in centers in Los Angeles, CA., METHODS: Youth consented and completed a baseline survey that collected self-reported data on HIV knowledge, condom use, and social network information. A quasi-experimental pretest/posttest design was used; 472 youth (66.5% retention at 1 month postbaseline) and 415 youth (58.5% retention at 3 months postbaseline) completed follow-up. In each intervention arm (AI and DC), 20% of youth was selected as PCAs and attended a 4-hour initial training, followed by 7 weeks of half-hour follow-up sessions. Youth disseminated messages promoting HIV knowledge and condom use., RESULTS: Using generalized estimating equation models, there was a significant reduction over time (P < 0.001) and a significant time by AI arm interaction (P < 0.001) for condomless anal sex act. There was a significant increase in HIV knowledge over time among PCAs in DC and AI arms., CONCLUSIONS: PCA models that promote HIV knowledge and condom use are efficacious for YEH. Youth are able to serve as a bridge between interventionists and their community. Interventionists should consider working with computer scientists to solve implementation problems.

N2  - Young adults experiencing homelessness are at high risk of opioid and other substance use, poor mental health outcomes, exposure to trauma, and other risks. Providing access to stable housing has the potential to act as a powerful preventive intervention, but supportive housing programs have been studied most often among chronically homeless adults or adults with serious mental illness. The Housing First model, which does not precondition supportive housing on sobriety, may reduce drug use in homeless adults. In the present study, we piloted an adapted model of Housing First plus prevention services that was tailored to the needs of young adults (18-24 years) experiencing homelessness in the USA. Preventive services were added to the Housing First model and included youth-centered advocacy services, motivational interviewing, and HIV risk prevention services. This model was piloted in a single-arm study (n = 21) to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of a Housing First model over a 6-month period in preparation for a larger randomized trial. We use repeated measures ANOVA to test for changes in alcohol and drug use (percent days of use; alcohol or drug use consequences), housing stability, social network support, and cognitive distortions over 6 months of follow-up. A total of 17 youth completed the study (85% retention), and a high proportion of youth were stably housed at 6-month follow-up. Participation in intervention services was high with an average of 13.57 sessions for advocacy, 1.33 for MI, and 0.76 for HIV prevention. Alcohol use did not change significantly over time. However, drug use, drug use consequences, and cognitive distortions, and the size of youths' social networks that were drug using individuals decreased significantly. The Housing First model appeared to be feasible to deliver, and youth engaged in the supportive intervention services. The study demonstrates the potential for an adapted Housing First model to be delivered to youth experiencing homelessness and may improve outcomes, opening the way for larger randomized trials of the intervention.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Mental health and substance use disorder (MHSUD) patients in the emergency department (ED) have been facing increasing lengths of stay due to a shortage of inpatient beds. Previous research indicates mobile crisis outreach (MCO) reduces long ED stays for MHSUD patients. Our objective was to assess the impact of MCO contact on future ED utilization., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients presenting to a large Midwest university ED with an MHSUD chief complaint from 2015-2018. We defined the exposure as those who had MCO contact and any MHSUD-related ED visit within 30 days of MCO contact. The MCO patients were 2:1 propensity score-matched by demographic data and comorbidities matched to patients with no MCO contact. Outcomes were all-cause and psychiatric-specific reasons for return to the ED within one year of the index ED visit. We report descriptive statistics and odds ratios (OR) to describe the difference between the two groups, and hazard ratios (HR) to estimate the risk of return ED visit., RESULTS: The final sample included 106 MCO and 196 non-MCO patients. The MCO patients were more likely to be homeless (OR 14.8; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.87, 117), less likely to have adequate family or social support (OR 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31, 0.84), and less likely to have a hospital bed requested for them in the index visit by ED providers (OR 0.50; 95% CI, 0.29, 0.88). For those who returned to the ED, the median time for all-cause return to the ED was 28 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 6-93 days) for the MCO patients and 88 days (IQR: 20-164 days) for non-MCO patients. The risk of all-cause return to the ED was greater among MCO patients (67%) compared to non-MCO patients (49%) (adjusted HR: 1.66; 95% CI, 1.22, 2.27)., CONCLUSION: The MCO patients had less family and social support; however, they were less likely to require hospitalization for each visit, likely due to MCO involvement. Patients with MCO contact presented to the ED more frequently than non-MCO patients, which implies a strong linkage between the ED and MCO in our community. An effective referral to community service from the ED and MCO and collaboration could be the next step to improve healthcare utilization.

N2  - Background: Ensuring young people experience good sexual health is a key public health concern, yet some vulnerable groups of young people remain at higher risk of poor sexual health. These individuals require additional support to achieve good sexual health but the best way to provide this remains needs to be better understood. Methods: We searched for randomised controlled trials of behavioural and psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting sexual health in high-risk young populations. Outcomes of interest were indicators of sexual health (e.g., condom use, attitudes to contraception, knowledge of risk). Participants were under 25 years old and in one of the following high-risk groups: alcohol and other drug use; ethnic minority; homeless; justice-involved; LGBTQI+; mental ill-health; or out-of-home care. Results: Twenty-eight papers from 26 trials met our inclusion criteria, with all but one conducted in North America. Condom use was the most frequently reported outcome measure along with knowledge and attitudes towards sexual health but considerable differences in measures used made comparisons across studies difficult. Change in knowledge and attitudes did not consistently result in long-term change in behaviours. Conclusions: There remains a dearth of research undertaken outside of North America across all high-risk groups of young people. Future interventions should address sexual health more broadly than just the absence of negative biological outcomes, with LGBTQI+, homeless and mental ill-health populations targeted for such work. An international consensus on outcome measures would support the research field going forward, making future meta-analyses possible.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Longitudinal studies examining the life trajectories of young people after they have exited homelessness have identified concerns with persistent social and economic exclusion, struggles to shake off identities of homelessness, and housing instability. This pilot study sought to explore the feasibility of improving socioeconomic inclusion outcomes by bolstering identity capital (sense of purpose and control, self-efficacy and self-esteem) among young people who had experienced homelessness., METHODS: Nineteen individuals (aged 18-26) who had transitioned out of homelessness within the past three years participated in a six-week, six-session program focused on building identity capital. The study employed a mixed method prospective cohort hybrid design with an intervention group (Group One) and a delayed intervention comparison group (Group Two). Participants were interviewed every three months until nine months post-intervention., RESULTS: None of the youth who began the intervention dropped out of the program, with the exception of one participant who moved across the country and was unable to continue. Immediately after participating in the intervention, Group One had statistically significant improvements (p < .05) and large to very large effect sizes in self-esteem (d = 1.16) and physical community integration (d = 1.79) compared to changes in Group Two over the same period, which had not yet begun the intervention. In the pooled analysis, small to moderate effect sizes in hopelessness, physical community integration, and self-esteem were observed at all post-intervention time points. Notably, at six- and nine-months post-intervention, statistically significant improvements (p < .05) and moderate effect sizes in hopelessness (d = -0.73 and d = -0.60 respectively) and self-esteem (d = 0.71 and d = 0.53 respectively) were observed. Youth shared they appreciated the normalizing (vs. pathologizing) of strategies they needed to learn and spoke of the importance of framing new skills as something one needs "to have a better life" vs. "to get better.", CONCLUSIONS: These early findings signal that targeting identity capital is feasible and may be a promising approach to incorporate into a more complex intervention that includes housing, education, and employment supports to help youth transition out of homelessness. Future research could build on these findings through a sufficiently powered randomized controlled trial.

N2  - People experiencing homelessness and serious mental illness exhibit high rates of criminal justice system involvement. Researchers have debated the causes of such involvement among people experiencing serious mental illness, including what services to prioritize. Some, for example, have emphasized mental illness while others have emphasized poverty. We examined factors associated with criminal convictions among people experiencing homelessness and serious mental illness recruited to the Vancouver At Home study. Participants were recruited between October 2009 and June 2011. Comprehensive administrative data were examined over the five-year period preceding study baseline to identify risk and protective factors associated with criminal convictions among participants (n = 425). Eight variables were independently associated with criminal convictions, some of which included drug dependence (RR = 1.53; P = 0.009), psychiatric hospitalization (RR = 1.44; P = 0.030), an irregular frequency of social assistance payments (compared to regular payments; 1.75; P < 0.001), and prior conviction (RR = 3.56; P < 0.001). Collectively, findings of the present study implicate poverty, social marginalization, crises involving mental illness, and the need for long-term recovery-oriented services that address these conditions to reduce criminal convictions among people experiencing homelessness and serious mental illness.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of opioid-related overdose deaths has been rising for 30 years and has been further exacerbated amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Naloxone can reverse opioid overdose, lower death rates, and enable a transition to medication for opioid use disorder. Though current formulations for community use of naloxone have been shown to be safe and effective public health interventions, they rely on bystander presence. We sought to understand the preferences and minimum necessary conditions for wearing a device capable of sensing and reversing opioid overdose among people who regularly use opioids., METHODS: We conducted a combined cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interview at a respite center, shelter, and syringe exchange drop-in program in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, during the COVID-19 pandemic in August and September 2020. The primary aim was to explore the proportion of participants who would use a wearable device to detect and reverse overdose. Preferences regarding designs and functionalities were collected via a questionnaire with items having Likert-based response options and a semi-structured interview intended to elicit feedback on prototype designs. Independent variables included demographics, opioid use habits, and previous experience with overdose., RESULTS: A total of 97 adults with an opioid use history of at least 3 months were interviewed. A majority of survey participants (76%) reported a willingness to use a device capable of detecting an overdose and automatically administering a reversal agent upon initial survey. When reflecting on the prototype, most respondents (75.5%) reported that they would wear the device always or most of the time. Respondents indicated discreetness and comfort as important factors that increased their chance of uptake. Respondents suggested that people experiencing homelessness and those with low tolerance for opioids would be in greatest need of the device., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of people sampled with a history of opioid use in an urban setting were interested in having access to a device capable of detecting and reversing an opioid overdose. Participants emphasized privacy and comfort as the most important factors influencing their willingness to use such a device., TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04530591. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

N2  - Two recent randomized controlled efficacy trials showed that harm-reduction treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD)-or patient-driven treatment that does not require abstinence and instead supports decreased alcohol-related harm and improved quality of life (QoL)-is efficacious for adults experiencing homelessness and AUD. The present study provides qualitative and quantitative analysis of one component of harm-reduction treatment, participants' harm-reduction goal-setting, within these two trials. Aims of this secondary, dual-trial study (Trial 1 N = 208, Trial 2 N = 86) were to describe participant-generated harm-reduction goals and determine whether aspects of harm-reduction goal-setting predict treatment outcomes. Across both trials, qualitative findings indicated improving QoL, meeting basic needs, improving physical and mental health, and changing drinking behavior were participants' top four goals. Only 2%-6% of goals centered on attaining alcohol abstinence. Regarding quantitative findings, Trial 1 showed statistically significant increases in goals generation over the course of treatment, while proportion of achieved goals stayed constant. In Trial 2, number of goals generated remained constant, while proportion of goals achieved increased. Trial 2 findings showed greater goal generation over time was associated with better physical health-related QoL, and drinking-related goals predicted improved alcohol outcomes. Overall, this secondary, dual-trial study suggests patient-driven goal-setting in harm-reduction treatment is feasible: Participants generated diverse, personalized, and clinically relevant goals. This study built on positive efficacy trial findings, indicating participants' generation of goals was associated with improved treatment outcomes. More research is needed to further understand more nuanced relationships between harm-reduction goal-setting and treatment outcomes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).

N2  - BACKGROUND: People experiencing homelessness have higher rates of HIV than those who are stably housed. Mental health needs, substance use problems, and issues unique to homelessness such as lack of shelter and transiency need to be considered with regard to HIV prevention. To date, HIV prevention interventions for young adults experiencing homelessness have not specifically addressed modifiable real-time factors such as stress, sexual or drug use urge, or substance use, or been delivered at the time of heightened risk. Real-time, personalized HIV prevention messages may reduce HIV risk behaviors., OBJECTIVE: This pilot study tested the initial efficacy of an innovative, smartphone-based, just-in-time adaptive intervention that assessed predictors of HIV risk behaviors in real time and automatically provided behavioral feedback and goal attainment information., METHODS: A randomized attention control design was used among young adults experiencing homelessness, aged 18-25 years, recruited from shelters and drop-in centers in May 2019. Participants were randomized to either a control or an intervention group. The intervention (called MY-RID [Motivating Youth to Reduce Infection and Disconnection]) consisted of brief messages delivered via smartphone over 6 weeks in response to preidentified predictors that were assessed using ecological momentary assessments. Bayesian hierarchical regression models were used to assess intervention effects on sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, and their corresponding urges., RESULTS: Participants (N=97) were predominantly youth (mean age 21.2, SD 2.1 years) who identified as heterosexual (n=51, 52%), male (n=56, 57%), and African American (n=56, 57%). Reports of sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, stress, and all urges (ie, sexual, drug, alcohol) reduced over time in both groups. Daily drug use reduced by a factor of 13.8 times over 6 weeks in the intervention group relative to the control group (Multimedia Appendix 4). Lower urges for sex were found in the intervention group relative to the control group over the duration of the study. Finally, there was a statistically significant reduction in reports of feeling stressed the day before between the intervention and control conditions (P=.03)., CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate promising intervention effects on drug use, stress, and urges for sex in a hard-to-reach, high-risk population. The MY-RID intervention should be further tested in a larger randomized controlled trial to further investigate its efficacy and impact on sexual risk behaviors., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03911024; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03911024.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone and extended-release injection naltrexone are effective treatments, with distinct mechanisms, for opioid use disorder. The authors examined whether patients' demographic and clinical characteristics were associated with better response to one medication or the other., METHODS: In a multisite 24-week randomized comparative-effectiveness trial of assignment to buprenorphine-naloxone (N=287) compared with extended-release naltrexone (N=283) comprising inpatients planning to initiate medication treatment for opioid use disorder, 50 demographic and clinical characteristics were examined as moderators of the effect of medication assignment on relapse to regular opioid use and failure to initiate medication. Moderator-by-medication interactions were estimated using logistic regression with correction for multiple testing., RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat sample, patients who reported being homeless had a lower relapse rate if they were assigned to receive extended-release naltrexone (51.6%) compared with buprenorphine-naloxone (70.4%) (odds ratio=0.45, 95% CI=0.22, 0.90); patients who were not homeless had a higher relapse rate if they were assigned to extended-release naltrexone (70.9%) compared with buprenorphine-naloxone (53.1%) (odds ratio=2.15, 95% CI=1.44, 3.21). In the subsample of patients who initiated medication, the interaction was not significant, with a similar pattern of lower relapse with extended-release naltrexone (41.4%) compared with buprenorphine (68.6%) among homeless patients (odds ratio=0.32, 95% CI=0.15, 0.68) but less difference among those not homeless (extended-release naltrexone, 57.2%; buprenorphine, 52.0%; odds ratio=1.24, 95% CI=0.80, 1.90). For failure to initiate medication, moderators were stated preference for medication (failure was less likely if the patient was assigned to the medication preferred), parole and probation status (fewer failures with extended-release naltrexone for those on parole or probation), and presence of pain and timing of randomization (more failure with extended-release naltrexone for patients endorsing moderate to severe pain and randomized early while still undergoing medically managed withdrawal)., CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with opioid use disorder admitted to inpatient treatment, homelessness, parole and probation status, medication preference, and factors likely to influence tolerability of medication initiation may be important in matching patients to buprenorphine or extended-release naltrexone.

N2  - Cognitive distortions are conceptualized as one of the most potent predictors of suicide. However, little is known about the mediating and moderating mechanisms linking cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation. The present study examined a prospective moderated mediation model linking cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation, with drug use, social problem-solving, and perceived burdensomeness as the mediators and childhood sexual abuse as the moderator. Participants included 150 homeless youth who participated in a randomized clinical trial for suicide intervention. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. We analyzed the data using a multiple-group path model. Findings showed that social problem-solving and perceived burdensomeness sequentially mediated the association between cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation regardless of childhood sexual abuse, whereas drug use mediated the association between cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation only among youth reporting no history of sexual abuse. Findings highlight how coping processes, both adaptive and maladaptive, operate differently to predict suicidal ideation contingent on the effects of childhood sexual abuse in the context of cognitive distortions. Findings also underscore the importance of addressing the effects of childhood abuse to facilitate the efficiency of interventions that seek to reduce suicidal ideation among a vulnerable population.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study evaluated the potential benefit to graduate students' of participating in a service-learning program conducting a storybook reading program for children in a family homeless shelter., METHOD: Ten graduate students in the second year of a two-year master's degree program in communication science and disorders participated in the storybook reading program. The graduate students engaged in reflective writing about their experiences and completed self-ratings of confidence in preliteracy skills before and after program participation. Twenty graduate students in two comparison groups (10 students in a pre-program comparison group, and 10 in a post-program comparison group) also completed questionnaires. The mixed-methods study used quantitative analyses to analyze questionnaire ratings and qualitative methods to analyze reflective writings., RESULTS: Together, the quantitative and qualitative results indicated positive outcomes from the service-learning experience with regard to graduate students' perceived confidence in preliteracy skills and preparation for careers as speech-language pathologists. The results provide empirical data showing that service-learning experiences with at-risk populations can contribute to graduate students' clinical education and preparation as speech-language pathologists., CONCLUSION: The results support the value of service-learning experiences in communication sciences and disorders. Clinical preparation in preliteracy development also supports the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association statement on the roles and responsibilities of speech-language pathologists in relation to reading and writing in children.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Youth experiencing homelessness are at high risk for suicide, yet few studies have evaluated risk reduction interventions targeting suicidal ideation in this vulnerable population. A comprehensive approach to risk-reduction is needed that addresses basic needs and provides targeted interventions for those at highest risk. The protocol described builds on the design of the first randomized trial of Housing First (HF) for homeless youth. The primary objective is to determine whether housing combined with supportive services that include suicide screening and targeted psychotherapy (Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention) is effective for reducing suicidal ideation and other secondary outcomes (depression and suicide attempts). Additionally, we will explore mediators of the treatment effect (housing stability and substance use) and determinants of implementation., METHODS: Youth recruited to the HF trial will be randomized to HF + supportive services (n = 120), or supportive services alone (n = 120). The "Suicide Treatment Education and Prevention" (STEP) protocol will additionally screen youth in both arms at baseline and 3 months for suicidal ideation (SSI-W). Those who screen as moderate risk for suicide (SSI-W >= 10) will be offered CTSP, which includes up to 9 sessions over the first 6 months following enrollment. CTSP will be delivered in one-on-one sessions by a trained advocate. Research assessments will be collected to assess outcomes (including suicidal ideation) at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Qualitative interviews with subjects receiving CTSP and other stakeholders will explore implementation determinants., DISCUSSION: The study will fill an important gap in the literature about the added benefit of HF combined with supportive services including suicide screening and treatment for reducing suicidal ideation in homeless youth. With the urgent need to address both homelessness and suicide risk, evidence is needed about services that can be integrated into delivery settings for youth experiencing homelessness., TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04135703 .

N2  - Homeless youth experience high rates of suicidal ideation and attempts, yet limited research has examined predictors of treatment engagement among this population. Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) between the ages of 18 and 24 years were recruited from a drop-in center in Columbus, Ohio. Participants were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention + treatment as usual through a local drop-in center (CTSP + TAU) (N = 75) or TAU alone (N = 75), and treatment attendance among those assigned to CTSP + TAU was examined in this study. As expected, among youth engaged in CTSP + TAU, those with a history of intimate partner violence (IPV) showed decreased odds of treatment attendance. Additionally, youth randomized into CTSP + TAU with higher acquired capability for suicide (ACS) scores and those identifying as Black were more likely to attend treatment sessions. Findings suggest that effective treatment implementation must consider youth's trauma history, demographics and severity of suicidal ideation and behaviors. Copyright © 2021.

N2  - Despite the high prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts among homeless youth, little research has examined how suicide prevention interventions influence suicide-related risk and protective factors, and ultimately produce positive outcome in suicidality in this population. Drawing on the Diathesis-Stress Model and the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, the current study examined whether participation in Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) moderated the mediation link between social problem-solving, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, and suicidal ideation among a sample of homeless youth experiencing suicidal ideation. Social problem-solving refers to a set of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral coping responses in the face of stressful situations, and it is identified as a potent protective factor in alleviating perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, and reducing suicidal ideation. Participants included 150 homeless youth (M age= 20.99, range = 18-24; 41% female) who were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) (n = 75) or Treatment as Usual alone (n = 75). Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Findings showed that perceived burdensomeness mediated the association of social problem-solving with suicidal ideation only among youth participating in the CTSP condition. These findings provide evidence to support the promising effects of CTSP in enhancing the protective effects of social problem-solving on suicidal ideation through the mediating effects of perceived burdensomeness. Findings also have implications for improving intervention effectiveness with a community-based population at high risk of suicide. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Homeless youth experience high rates of substance use disorders, exposures to violence, mental and physical health conditions, and mortality. They have been particularly affected by the opioid crisis. However, no study to date has used a randomized controlled design to test preventive interventions of opioid and other drug use among this vulnerable population. Resolution of youth homelessness through housing and supportive services including prevention services, often referred to as "Housing First," has great potential to reduce the likelihood for the development of an opioid use disorder as well as other problem behaviors associated with living on the streets. Housing First has been tested through randomized trials among homeless adults with mental health and substance use disorders, but has not been empirically tested for opioid prevention among homeless youth., METHODS: Homeless youth will be recruited from a drop-in shelter site frequented by disconnected youth; they will be screened for eligibility, including current homelessness, age 18-24 years, and not currently meeting criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). In a controlled trial, 240 youth will then be randomized to one of two conditions, (1) housing + opioid and related risk prevention services, or (2) opioid and related risk prevention services alone. This project utilizes existing efficacious models of prevention to address opioid-related risks, including motivational interviewing, strengths-based outreach and advocacy, and an HIV risk preventive intervention. Follow-up will be conducted at 3, 6, 9 and 12-months post-baseline. The economic cost of each intervention will be determined to support implementation decisions with other providers and their funders., DISCUSSION: This study will provide essential information for researchers and providers on the efficacy of housing + opioid and related risk prevention services in an RCT for effects on opioid use and mechanisms underlying change. Because youth experiencing homelessness are at increased risk for a variety of adverse outcomes, the proposed intervention may produce substantial health care benefits to the youths and society at large.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Smoking rates are alarmingly high among young people experiencing homelessness (YEH), yet there are no evidence-based cessation programs for this population. This paper presents results from a pilot evaluation of a text messaging-based smoking cessation treatment, as an adjunct to brief group cessation counseling, to improve abstinence rates among 18-25-year-old smokers experiencing homelessness. The goal of this study was to estimate effect sizes for a larger trial and it was not powered to detect group differences., AIMS AND METHODS: YEH smokers who had a working cell phone with them at recruitment were randomized to receive a group counseling session, nicotine patches, and written material on quitting (n = 37) or a similar program that also included a 6-week automated text messaging intervention (TMI) to provide ongoing support for quitting (n = 40). Smoking outcomes were evaluated through a 90-day follow-up., RESULTS: Seven-day point prevalence abstinence at 90-day follow-up was higher in the TMI condition than standard condition (17.50% vs. 8.11%, respectively; Cohen's h = .37); however, the 90-day continuous abstinence rate was not statistically different from zero in either condition. Reductions in the number of days smoked in the past 30 days from baseline to follow-up were greater in the TMI condition than the standard condition (-14.24 vs. -8.62, respectively; Cohen's d = .49)., CONCLUSIONS: Adding a 6-week TMI support to a brief group counseling and pharmacotherapy protocol holds promise for smoking reduction and abstinence among YEH smokers. Results indicate that further development and evaluation of the TMI in this population is warranted., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03874585. Registered March 14, 2019, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03874585., IMPLICATIONS: This is the first study to evaluate the feasibility of using a text messaging-based intervention (TMI) for behavior change with 18-25 year olds experiencing homelessness, and more specifically, the first to test a TMI to provide ongoing support for smoking cessation. Small to medium effect sizes for the TMI are promising in terms of implementing a TMI using participants' own cell phones, as well as the efficacy of this approach as an adjunct to standard care (brief group counseling and pharmacotherapy) for smoking cessation among YEH.

N2  - Research on incarceration has focused on prisons, but jail detention is far more common than imprisonment. Jails are local institutions that detain people before trial or incarcerate them for short sentences for low-level offenses. Research from the 1970s and 1980s viewed jails as "managing the rabble," a small and deeply disadvantaged segment of urban populations that struggled with problems of addiction, mental illness, and homelessness. The 1990s and 2000s marked a period of mass criminalization in which new styles of policing and court processing produced large numbers of criminal cases for minor crimes, concentrated in low-income communities of color. In a period of widespread criminal justice contact for minor offenses, how common is jail incarceration for minority men, particularly in poor neighborhoods? We estimate cumulative risks of jail incarceration with an administrative data file that records all jail admissions and discharges in New York City from 2008 to 2017. Although New York has a low jail incarceration rate, we find that 26.8% of Black men and 16.2% of Latino men, in contrast to only 3% of White men, in New York have been jailed by age 38 y. We also find evidence of high rates of repeated incarceration among Black men and high incarceration risks in high-poverty neighborhoods. Despite the jail's great reach in New York, we also find that the incarcerated population declined in the study period, producing a large reduction in the prevalence of jail incarceration for Black and Latino men.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Smoking rates are significantly higher among young people experiencing homelessness than in the general population. Despite a willingness to quit, homeless youth have little success in doing so on their own, and existing cessation resources tailored to this population are lacking. Homeless youth generally enjoy the camaraderie and peer support that group-based programs offer, but continuous in-person support during a quit attempt can be prohibitively expensive., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an automated text messaging intervention (TMI) as an adjunct to group-based cessation counseling and provision of nicotine patches to help homeless youth quit smoking. This paper outlines the lessons learned from the implementation of the TMI intervention., METHODS: Homeless youth smokers aged 18 to 25 years who were interested in quitting (n=77) were recruited from drop-in centers serving homeless youth in the Los Angeles area. In this pilot randomized controlled trial, all participants received a group-based cessation counseling session and nicotine patches, with 52% (40/77) randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of text messages to provide additional support for their quit attempt. Participants received text messages on their own phone rather than receiving a study-issued phone for the TMI. We analyzed baseline and follow-up survey data as well as back-end data from the messaging platform to gauge the acceptability and feasibility of the TMI among the 40 participants who received it., RESULTS: Participants had widespread (smart)phone ownership-16.4% (36/219) were ineligible for study participation because they did not have a phone that could receive text messages. Participants experienced interruptions in their phone use (eg, 44% [16/36] changed phone numbers during the follow-up period) but reported being able to receive the majority of messages. These survey results were corroborated by back-end data (from the program used to administer the TMI) showing a message delivery rate of about 95%. Participant feedback points to the importance of carefully crafting text messages, which led to high (typically above 70%) approval of most text messaging components of the intervention. Qualitative feedback indicated that participants enjoyed the group counseling session that preceded the TMI and suggested including more such group elements into the intervention., CONCLUSIONS: The TMI was well accepted and feasible to support smoking cessation among homeless youth. Given high rates of smartphone ownership, the next generation of phone-based smoking cessation interventions for this population should consider using approaches beyond text messages and focus on finding ways to develop effective approaches to include group interaction using remote implementation. Given overall resource constraints and in particular the exigencies of the currently ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, phone-based interventions are a promising approach to support homeless youth, a population urgently in need of effective smoking cessation interventions., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03874585; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03874585., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR2-10.1186/s13722-020-00187-6.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear what the best strategy is for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among residents of homeless shelters and what individual factors are associated with testing positive for the virus. We sought to evaluate factors associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among residents of homeless shelters and to evaluate positivity rates in shelters where testing was conducted in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks or for surveillance., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart audit to obtain repeated cross-sectional data from outreach testing done at homeless shelters between Apr. 1 and July 31, 2020, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We compared the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate for shelters where testing was conducted because of an outbreak (at least 1 known case) with those tested for surveillance (no known cases). A patient-level analysis evaluated differences in demographic, health and behavioural characteristics of residents who did and did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2 at shelters with at least 2 positive cases., RESULTS: One thousand nasopharyngeal swabs were done on 872 unique residents at 20 shelter locations. Among the 504 tests done in outbreak settings, 69 (14%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 1 (0.2%) was indeterminate. Among the 496 tests done for surveillance, 11 (2%) were positive and none were indeterminate. Shelter residents who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were significantly less likely to have a health insurance card (54% v. 72%, p = 0.03) or to have visited another shelter in the last 14 days (0% v. 18%, p < 0.01). There was no association between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and medical history or symptoms., INTERPRETATION: Our findings support testing of asymptomatic shelter residents for SARS-CoV-2 when a positive case is identified at the same shelter. Surveillance testing when there are no known positive cases may detect outbreaks, but further research should identify efficient strategies given scarce testing resources.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Misuse/abuse of pregabalin is increasing worldwide. French Poison Control Centers (PCCs) recently received several unusual calls regarding the recreational use of pregabalin in adolescents. This study aims to describe this new and specific population of pregabalin misusers., METHODS: We extracted all cases of pregabalin intentional exposures reported to the French National Database of Poisonings (FNDP) from 2004 to 2020. We compared the proportion of recreational exposure to pregabalin between adolescents (10-17 years) and adults (>18 years). We reviewed all cases of pregabalin recreational exposures in adolescent in order to describe the characteristics of this population., RESULTS: During the study period, 382 cases of acute intentional exposure to pregabalin were reported in adolescents and 1188 in adults, 94/382 (24.6%) and 43/1188 (3.6%) were pregabalin recreational use, respectively (p < .0001). Almost all cases of pregabalin recreational use in adolescent were reported from 2018 (86/94; 91%). Most of those adolescent patients were males (male/female ratio - 5.3:1) and the median age was 15 years (range: 11-17.8). They were homeless or living in migrant shelters in most of the cases (73/90, 81%). Two-third of these exposures (62/94; 66%) involved other toxicant(s) than pregabalin. Most of the patients remains asymptomatic (10/94; 11%), or developed minor to moderate neurological symptoms (76/94; 81%). Eight developed severe symptoms (8/94; 8%) including coma (5/8) or generalized seizures (2/8). Five patients (5/8) required oro-tracheal intubation. No fatality was reported., CONCLUSIONS: We observed a sharp increase in pregabalin recreational use in adolescents in France. It should lead to prevention campaigns, targeted at the population at risk described in this study.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Studies indicate high rates of substance use among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH). Further, the social networks of YEH, although multi-dimensional in composition, are largely comprised of other YEH, substance users, and individuals who do not provide the youth with tangible or emotional support. For YEH who have the opportunity to enter a housing program, helping them to reduce their substance use and strengthen their prosocial supportive connections during this critical transition period may increase their stability and reduce their risk of re-entering homelessness. The goal of this study is to pilot test a brief motivational network intervention (MNI), delivered by case managers, to help former YEH who have recently transitioned to a housing program reduce their substance use and strengthen their prosocial supportive connections., METHODS/DESIGN: Up to 60 residents of housing programs in the Los Angeles area will be randomized to receive four sessions of usual case manager support or four sessions of case manager support + MNI. Each MNI session consists of three parts: (1) identifying two goals that are most important for the resident over the next year (e.g., get or keep a job, finish or stay in school, reduce substance use); (2) a network interview with the resident to capture network data pertaining to their interactions in the past 2 weeks; and (3) a discussion between the case manager and the resident of the resulting network visualizations, conducted in a Motivational Interviewing (MI) style, and what role the resident's network may play in reaching their most important goals over the next year., DISCUSSION: This study addresses a critical gap by pilot testing a computer-assisted MNI, delivered using MI techniques, that can help case managers work with recent YEH to reduce substance use and increase permanent supportive connections during the critical transitional period from homelessness to housing.

N2  - Youth homelessness has been demonstrated to disproportionately affect sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth compared to heterosexual cisgender peers. In this context, we aimed to compare health risks between service-seeking SGM and heterosexual cisgender youth experiencing homelessness, including harmful risks stemming from substance use and severity of symptoms of mental health disorders. We recruited 100 racially diverse, unstably housed participants aged 18-24 who access services at an urban non-profit organization in San Francisco, CA. Data analysis included 56 SGM participants who identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, unsure, transgender, and nongender, and 44 heterosexual cisgender participants. In contrast to previous studies reporting significantly higher frequency of substance use and more severe symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder among SGM youth compared to heterosexual cisgender peers, many of these health disparities were not observed in our diverse study population of service-seeking youth. Furthermore, with the exception of methamphetamine, SGM participants did not exhibit greater harmful risks resulting from substance use, such as health, social, financial, and legal complications. We discuss the reduced burden of health disparities between SGM and heterosexual cisgender youth in our service-seeking study population within the context of gender- and sexuality-affirming programming offered at the partnering community organization. We conclude that longitudinal data on these tailored community-level interventions are needed to further explore the reduced burden of health disparities observed among service-seeking SGM youth experiencing homelessness in San Francisco in order to continue supporting pathways out of homelessness for youth of all sexual and gender identities nationwide.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Researchers have pointed out the paucity of research investigating long-term consequences of experiencing homelessness in childhood or youth. Limited research has indicated that the experience of homelessness in childhood or youth is associated with adverse adjustment-related consequences in adulthood. Housing First (HF) has acknowledged effectiveness in improving housing outcomes among adults experiencing homelessness and living with serious mental illness, although some HF clients struggle with maintaining housing. The current study was conducted to examine whether the experience of homelessness in childhood or youth increases the odds of poorer housing stability following entry into high-fidelity HF among adults experiencing serious mental illness and who were formerly homeless., METHODS: Data were drawn from the active intervention arms of a HF randomized controlled trial in Metro Vancouver, Canada. Participants (n = 297) were referred to the study from service agencies serving adults experiencing homelessness and mental illness between October 2009 and June 2011. The Residential Time-Line Follow-Back Inventory was used to measure housing stability. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to estimate the association between first experiencing homelessness in childhood or youth and later housing stability as an adult in HF., RESULTS: Analyses indicated that homelessness in childhood or youth was negatively associated with experiencing housing stability as an adult in HF (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.31-0.90)., CONCLUSIONS: Further supports are needed within HF to increase housing stability among adult clients who have experienced homelessness in childhood or youth. Asking clients about the age they first experienced homelessness may be of clinical utility upon enrollment in HF and may help identify support needs related to developmental experiences. Results further emphasize the importance of intervening earlier in life in childhood and youth before experiencing homelessness or before it becomes chronic. Findings also contribute to a limited knowledge base regarding the adverse long-term consequences of childhood and youth homelessness., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN57595077 and ISRCTN66721740 .

N2  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about trends in overdose behaviors. This study explored non-fatal overdose and engagement in overdose prevention behaviors and compared these trends to city-wide overdose fatality rates from 2017 to 2019 in Baltimore, MD., METHODS: The analysis included people who used opioids (PWUO; N=502) recruited through a community-based study. Enrollment date was used to categorize participants into annual quarters. Logistic regression models examined change in overdose experiences and prevention behaviors with time. Baltimore's fatal overdoses were also mapped over the study period to assess overlaps in trends., RESULTS: The majority of the sample were male(68 %), Black(61 %), reported past 6 months homelessness(56 %), and were on average 45 years old. Most had witnessed(61 %), and 28 % had personally experienced an overdose in the past 6 months. Witnessing overdose marginally increased(abeta=0.182;p=0.058) while experiencing overdose did not significantly change by enrollment quarter. Most participants had or had been prescribed naloxone(72 %), and one fifth(22 %) regularly carried naloxone, with both access to(abeta=0,408;p=0.002) and carrying naloxone(abeta=0.302;p=0.006) increasing over time. Overdose communication remained stable, with 63 % of participants reporting discussing overdose sometimes/often. Among participants who injected (n=376), regularly injecting alone decreased(abeta=-0.207;p=0.055), and reporting others often/always having naloxone with them when injecting increased over time(abeta=0.573;p<0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Witnessed overdose marginally increased from 2017 to 2019, aligning with city trends of fatal overdose. Overdose prevention behaviors significantly increased over time. Despite reporting having naloxone or a naloxone prescription, most PWUO did not regularly carry naloxone, and many used alone. Social network diffusion interventions may be a strategy to promote normative overdose prevention behaviors. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we compare the effects of methamphetamine use versus other drugs on viremia in sexual minority men on antiretroviral therapy (ART)., METHODS: HIV-positive participants currently on ART (N = 230) were selected from an ongoing cohort of diverse young sexual minority men (mSTUDY) enrolled from August 2014 to May 2018. Substance use and sociodemographic factors associated with viremia outcomes were assessed using ordinal regression analysis with generalized estimating equations. Viremia outcomes were grouped as undetectable (<20 copies/mL), low level suppressed (21-200 copies/mL), or not suppressed (>200 copies/mL)., RESULTS: The prevalence of drug use across 825 study visits was 73 %, with methamphetamine use most prevalent (50 %). After adjusting for unstable housing and ART adherence, methamphetamine use, either alone (adjusted OR = 1.87; 95 % CI 1.03-3.40) or with other drugs (adjusted OR = 1.82; 95 % CI 1.12-2.95), was associated with higher odds of increasing viremia compared to no drug use. Other drug use excluding methamphetamine did not show a similar association (adjusted OR = 1.29; 95 % CI 0.80-2.09). Among our study population, nearly half the instances of viremia could be reduced if methamphetamine was discontinued (attributable fraction = 46 %; 95 % CI 3-71 %)., CONCLUSIONS: Methamphetamine use, either alone or in combination with other drugs, is associated with failure of viral suppression among sexual minority men on ART independent of adherence and sociodemographic factors. This accounts for nearly half of the observed instances of unsuppressed viremia in this study. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Individuals often report concurrent social risk factors such as food insecurity, unstable housing, and transportation barriers. Comparing relative changes between pairs of social risk factors may identify those that are more resistant to change., OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a method to describe relative changes in pairs of social risk factors., RESEARCH DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study., SUBJECTS: Participants in a randomized controlled trial of hypertension care in an Urban Indian Health Organization., MEASURES: We measured 7 social risk factors (housing, transportation, food, clothing, health care, utilities, and debts) at enrollment, 6, and 12 months among 295 participants in the trial. We hypothesized that pairwise comparisons could identify social risk factors that were less likely to change over time. We used conditional odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to rank each pair., RESULTS: Food, clothing, health care, utilities, and debts had more changes between 0 and 6 months relative to housing (OR=2.3, 3.4, 4.7, 3.5, and 3.4, respectively; all 95% CI excluded 1.0). These same social risk factors also had more changes between baseline and 6 months relative to transportation (OR=2.8, 3.4, 4.9, 4.7, and 4.1, respectively; all 95% CI excluded 1.0). Changes in housing and transportation risk factors were comparable (OR=0.7, 95% CI: 0.4-1.4). Relative changes between 6 and 12 months were similar., CONCLUSIONS: Housing and transportation exhibited fewer relative changes than other social risk factors and might be more resistant to change. Awareness of the relationships between social risk factors can help define priorities for intervention. Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Children who have been exposed to public (out-of-home) care experience a range of negative outcomes by late adolescence and early adulthood. The longer-term impact of childhood care is, however, uncertain., AIM: To examine if there is a prospective association between childhood public care and adverse life outcomes in middle-age., METHODS: We used data from the UK 1958 birth cohort study of 18 558 individuals. Parents reported offspring care status at age 7, 11 and 16. An array of social, criminal, cognitive, and health outcomes was self-reported by cohort members at age 42 (71% response proportion in eligible sample) and a cognitive test battery was administered at age 50 (62% response)., RESULTS: A total of 420 (3.8%) of 11 160 people in the analytical sample experienced childhood public care by age 16. Net of confounding factors, experience of public care (vs none) was linked to 11 of the 28 non-mutually exclusive endpoints captured in middle-age, with the most consistent effects apparent for psychosocial characteristics: 4/7 sociodemographic (eg, odds ratio; 95% confidence interval for homelessness: 2.1; 1.4 to 3.1); 2/2 antisocial (eg, use of illicit drug: 2.0; 1.2 to 3.5); 2/3 psychological (eg, mental distress: 1.6; 1.2 to 2.1); 1/3 health behaviours (eg, current cigarette smoker: 1.7; 1.3 to 2.2); 2/8 somatic health (physical disability: 2.7; 1.9 to 3.8); and 0/5 cognitive function (eg, beta coefficient; 95% confidence interval for immediate word recall: -0.1; -0.3 to 0.1) endpoints., CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that selected associations apparent between childhood care and outcomes in adolescence and early adulthood are also evident in middle-age.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Homeless shelters are a high-risk setting for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission because of crowding and shared hygiene facilities., OBJECTIVE: To investigate SARS-CoV-2 case counts across several adult and family homeless shelters in a major metropolitan area., DESIGN: Cross-sectional, community-based surveillance study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04141917)., SETTING: 14 homeless shelters in King County, Washington., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1434 study encounters were done in shelter residents and staff, regardless of symptoms., INTERVENTION: 2 strategies were used for SARS-CoV-2 testing: routine surveillance and contact tracing ("surge testing") events., MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measure was test positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection at shelters, determined by dividing the number of positive cases by the total number of participant encounters, regardless of symptoms. Sociodemographic, clinical, and virologic variables were assessed as correlates of viral positivity., RESULTS: Among 1434 encounters, 29 (2% [95% CI, 1.4% to 2.9%]) cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected across 5 shelters. Most (n = 21 [72.4%]) were detected during surge testing events rather than routine surveillance, and most (n = 21 [72.4% {CI, 52.8% to 87.3%}]) were asymptomatic at the time of sample collection. Persons who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 were more frequently aged 60 years or older than those without SARS-CoV-2 (44.8% vs. 15.9%). Eighty-six percent of persons with positive test results slept in a communal space rather than in a private or shared room., LIMITATION: Selection bias due to voluntary participation and a relatively small case count., CONCLUSION: Active surveillance and surge testing were used to detect multiple cases of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in homeless shelters. The findings suggest an unmet need for routine viral testing outside of clinical settings for homeless populations., PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Gates Ventures.

N2  - Longitudinal studies of cannabis exposure during early adolescence in the general population frequently report an increased risk of subsequently developing psychotic symptoms or a psychotic illness. However, there is a dearth of knowledge about the effects of early cannabis exposure on psychosis in homeless and precariously housed adults, who represent a population afflicted with high rates of psychosis. The aim of the present study was to examine how early cannabis exposure (by age 15) compared to later first use (after age 15) affected the expression of adult psychosis in this population. Secondary measures of psychopathology, drug use, cognition and brain structure were also collected. 437 subjects were recruited from single room occupancy hotels in the urban setting of the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, Canada. Psychiatric diagnoses were determined, and psychotic symptom severity was measured with the 5-factor PANSS. Participants completed a battery of neurocognitive tests, and brain structure was assessed using structural and diffusion tensor imaging MRI scans. Results indicated that early cannabis exposure was associated with an increased risk (OR = 1.09, p < .05) of developing substance induced psychosis, whereas later first use increased risk (OR = 2.19, p < .01) of developing schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. There was no group difference in neurocognitive function, although differences were observed in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and white matter tract diffusivity. These findings indicate that early cannabis exposure in this population may increase the risk of developing drug associated psychoses, which could potentially be mediated in part through altered neurodevelopmental brain changes.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: An earlier study from Nova Scotia showed that food insecurity (FI) is more prevalent (21.9%) in families of children with diabetes, yet little is known about its impact on these families. We aimed to describe the day-to-day experiences of families living with FI while caring for a child with type 1 diabetes (T1D)., METHODS: This investigation was a qualitative study with thematic analyses using semistructured interviews to explore perceptions of caregivers living with pediatric T1D and FI (N=13 households)., RESULTS: Three major themes emerged: 1) FI had a disproportionate impact on families after T1D diagnosis compared with before diagnosis. The cost of healthy food threatened food security before T1D; however, there is increased hardship once high-quality food and hypoglycemia supplies are required. 2) Sacrifices to combat FI have disproportionate impacts among family members. At times, caregivers sacrificed the needs (food, medicine) of other family members (including children) to prioritize the needs of the child with T1D. 3) Caregivers perceived T1D needs as posing unique barriers to traditional FI supports, such as school breakfast programs., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the realities of life with pediatric T1D and FI. Living with T1D and FI poses challenges, and caregivers often cope by making difficult choices when providing for their family. Caregivers struggled to meet dietary recommendations while finding that T1D needs are often not met by traditional FI supports. This suggests that T1D clinicians should assess FI and help families in problem solving to mitigate its impact. Copyright © 2020 Canadian Diabetes Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There is currently an incomplete picture of the long-term impact of homelessness on youth with mental health issues. There are also questions regarding homelessness as a predictor of mental health re-admissions., AIMS: To examine the mental health service presentation profile of young people affected by homelessness and mental health issues., METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of the medical records of homeless (n = 29) and non-homeless (n = 32) youth who attended the YouthLink specialist mental health service in 2010. We tracked their pattern of mental health service admissions at five time points during a total period of 10 years, including 2 years prior to, and up to 8 years following the YouthLink presentation. A regression analysis was used to examine factors hypothesized to contribute to mental health re-admissions., RESULTS: Homeless youth had significantly more frequent presentations to inpatient and outpatient mental health services, and emergency departments for mental health reasons. They were 11 times more likely to be re-admitted to a mental health inpatient ward than non-homeless youth. Prior hospital admission was an independent predictor, increasing by a factor of 2.2 for every inpatient admission., CONCLUSION: The impact of homelessness on mental health issues is enduring, and is a long-term predictor of hospital re-admission.

N2  - My Baby's First Teacher is an intervention designed specifically for parents with infants staying in emergency homeless shelters. Infants are overrepresented in shelter populations and face considerable risk to their development, including mental health. We utilized a randomized controlled design across three family shelters to evaluate the program's effectiveness with 24 dyads assigned to the intervention compared to 21 dyads in care-as-usual. Dyads were randomized by round at each site to account for shelter effects. We used path analysis to illustrate change over time and in relation to intervention assignment.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Our objective was to determine the proportion of patients in our emergency department (ED) who are unhoused or marginally housed and when they typically present to the ED., METHODS: We surveyed patients in an urban, safety-net ED from June-August 2018, using a sampling strategy that met them at all times of day, every day of the week. Patients used two social needs screening tools with additional questions on housing during sampling shifts representing two full weeks. Housing status was determined using items validated for housing stability, including PRAPARE, the Accountable Health Communities Survey, and items from the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Propensity scores estimated differences among respondents and non-respondents., RESULTS: Of those surveyed, 35% (95% confidence interval [CI], 31-38) identified as homeless and 28% (95% CI, 25-31) as unstably housed. Respondents and non-respondents were similar by propensity score. The average cumulative number of homeless and unstably housed patients arriving per daily 8-hour window peaks at 7 AM, with 46% (95% CI, 29-64) of the daily aggregate of those reporting homelessness and 44% (95% CI, 24-64) with unstable housing presenting over the next eight hours., CONCLUSION: The ED represents a low-barrier contact point for reaching individuals experiencing housing challenges, who may interact rarely with other institutions. The current prevalence of homelessness and housing instability among urban ED patients may be substantially higher than reported in historical and national-level statistics. Housing services offered within normal business hours would reach a meaningful number of those who are unhoused or marginally housed.

N2  - Finding fulfillment of basic psychological needs may be difficult for parents living in shelters after becoming homeless or after escaping violence. This study tested if experiencing nature was associated with the basic psychological needs of parents in shelters. Need satisfaction and need frustration were measured among parents in shelters (N = 160), with one measurement in the standard indoor context of the shelter and one measurement while experiencing nature. Experiencing nature was associated with enhanced need satisfaction (d = 0.28) and reduced need frustration (d = -0.24). The effect was especially pronounced for parents with young children. Our findings suggest that the physical environment matters for parents' basic psychological need fulfillment as they interact with their children in the context of sheltering. This finding opens a potential avenue for supporting parental functioning and resilience in the face of risk if these effects were to be replicated across settings using controlled experimental designs. At the very least, the findings may be discussed with practitioners and parents in the context of making shelter life and work more conducive to mental health and family functioning.

N2  - Importance: Responding to the substantial research on the relationship between social risk factors and health, enthusiasm has grown around social risk screening in health care settings, and numerous US health systems are experimenting with social risk screening initiatives. In the absence of standard social risk screening recommendations, some health systems are exploring using publicly available community-level data to identify patients who live in the most vulnerable communities as a way to characterize patient social and economic contexts, identify patients with potential social risks, and/or to target social risk screening efforts., Objective: To explore the utility of community-level data for accurately identifying patients with social risks by comparing the social deprivation index score for the census tract where a patient lives with patient-level social risk screening data., Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study using patient-level social risk screening data from the electronic health records of a national network of community health centers between June 24, 2016, and November 15, 2018, linked to geocoded community-level data from publicly available sources. Eligible patients were those with a recorded response to social risk screening questions about food, housing, and/or financial resource strain, and a valid address of sufficient quality for geocoding., Exposures: Social risk screening documented in the electronic health record., Main Outcomes and Measures: Community-level social risk was assessed using census tract-level social deprivation index score stratified by quartile. Patient-level social risks were identified using food insecurity, housing insecurity, and financial resource strain screening responses., Results: The final study sample included 36578 patients from 13 US states; 22113 (60.5%) received public insurance, 21181 (57.9%) were female, 17578 (48.1%) were White, and 10918 (29.8%) were Black. Although 6516 (60.0%) of those with at least 1 social risk factor were in the most deprived quartile of census tracts, patients with social risk factors lived in all census tracts. Overall, the accuracy of the community-level data for identifying patients with and without social risks was 48.0%., Conclusions and Relevance: Although there is overlap, patient-level and community-level approaches for assessing patient social risks are not equivalent. Using community-level data to guide patient-level activities may mean that some patients who could benefit from targeted interventions or care adjustments would not be identified.

N2  - The mental health and related quality of life of runaway adolescents are global public health issues. As few intervention studies have considered the family contexts of runaway adolescents, we aimed to develop an intervention tailored specifically to the needs of this population using an Intervention Mapping protocol. First, a literature review and interviews with runaway adolescents and youth shelter workers were conducted to create a logic model of the problem. Second, the behavioral and environmental outcomes were set to adapt to stressful situations and enable families to become more resourceful in dealing with family adversity, based on the results of needs assessment. Performance objectives and changeable determinants were also created by reviewing the pertinent theories and studies. Third, theory- and evidence-based methods to influence changes in the determinants were identified. Fourth, we designed an eight-session family-based mental health program incorporating individual and family approaches for runaway adolescents. Fifth, we determined that mental health nurses at community mental health centers linked to youth shelters would serve as the program implementers. Finally, we planned a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of our program on improving runaway adolescents' mental health status and perceived family functioning.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Global investments in neonatal survival have resulted in a growing number of children with morbidities surviving and requiring ongoing care. Little is known about the caregivers of these children in low- and middle-income countries, including maternal mental health which can further negatively impact child health and development outcomes. We aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with poor maternal mental health in mothers of children born preterm, low birthweight (LBW), and with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) at 24-47 months of age in rural Rwanda., METHODS: Cross-sectional study of children 24-47 months born preterm, LBW, or with HIE, and their mothers discharged from the Neonatal Care Unit (NCU) at Kirehe Hospital between May 2015-April 2016 or discharged and enrolled in a NCU follow-up program from May 2016-November 2017. Households were interviewed between October 2018 and June 2019. Mothers reported on their mental health and their child's development; children's anthropometrics were measured directly. Backwards stepwise procedures were used to assess factors associated with poor maternal mental health using logistic regression., RESULTS: Of 287 total children, 189 (65.9%) were born preterm/LBW and 34.1% had HIE and 213 (74.2%) screened positive for potential caregiver-reported disability. Half (n = 148, 51.6%) of mothers reported poor mental health. In the final model, poor maternal mental health was significantly associated with use of violent discipline (Odds Ratio [OR] 2.29, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.17,4.45) and having a child with caregiver-reported disability (OR 2.96, 95% CI 1.55, 5.67). Greater household food security (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.92) and being married (OR = 0.12, 95% CI 0.04-0.36) or living together as if married (OR = 0.13, 95% CI 0.05, 0.37) reduced the odds of poor mental health., CONCLUSIONS: Half of mothers of children born preterm, LBW and with HIE had poor mental health indicating a need for interventions to identify and address maternal mental health in this population. Mother's poor mental health was also associated with negative parenting practices. Specific interventions targeting mothers of children with disabilities, single mothers, and food insecure households could be additionally beneficial given their strong association with poor maternal mental health.

T1  - Gains in life expectancy in the Australian population due to reductions in smoking: comparisons between interventions targeting the population versus interventions in a specific high risk group.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Four decades of population-based tobacco control strategies have contributed to substantial reduction in smoking prevalence in Australia. However, smoking prevalence is still double in socially disadvantaged groups compared to those that are not. But not all tobacco control strategies successfully used in the general population is effective in specific high-risk population groups. Hence, an effective way to reduce smoking in high risk population groups may include targeting them specifically to identify and support smokers to quit. In this backdrop, we examined whether tobacco control interventions at the population-level are more effective in increasing life expectancy among Australians compared to interventions targeting a high risk group or a combination of the two when smoking prevalence is reduced to 10 and 0% respectively., METHODS: Using the risk percentiles approach, analyses were performed separately for men and women using data from various sources such as the 2014-15 National Health Survey linked to death registry, simulated data for high risk groups, and the Australian population and deaths data from the census. Indigenous status was simulated by preferentially assigning those who are indigenous to lower SES quintiles. The age-sex distribution of mental disorder status was simulated using its distribution from 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey with 25.9% of mentally ill being assigned to current smoking category and the rest to non-smoking category. The age-sex distribution of prisoners was simulated based on 2014 ABS Prisoners Australia survey with 74% of prisoners being assigned to current smoker category and the rest to non-smoker category. Homelessness status was simulated according to age, sex and indigenous status for 2011 census with all homeless being allocated to the lowest SES category. The age-sex distribution of total cholesterol level was simulated based on 2011-13 Australian Health Survey., RESULTS: The results showed that the combined approach for reducing smoking is most effective for improving life expectancy of Australians particularly for the socially disadvantaged and mentally ill groups both of which have high fraction of smokers in the population. For those who were mentally ill the gain in ALE due to reduction of smoking to 10% was 0.53 years for males and 0.36 years for females which were around 51 and 42% respectively of the maximal gains in ALE that could be achieved through complete cessation., CONCLUSIONS: Targeting high-risk population groups having substantial fraction of smokers in the population can strongly complement the existing population-based smoking reduction strategies. As population and high risk approaches are both important, the national prevention policies should make judicious use of both to maximize health gain.

N2  - Background Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality among people experiencing homelessness. This study investigated whether housing intervention affects cardiovascular disease risk factors among homeless adults with mental illnesses over a 24-month period. Methods and Results We conducted a randomized controlled trial of a Housing First intervention that provided community-based scattered-site housing and support services. Five hundred seventy-five participants were randomized to the intervention (n=301) or treatment as usual (TAU) (n=274). Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle using generalized estimating equations. There were no differences in change over 24 months between the 2 groups for blood pressure, tobacco, and cocaine/crack use. However, the intervention had an impact on reducing the number of days of alcohol intoxication by 1.58 days compared with TAU (95% CI, -2.88 to -0.27, P=0.0018). Over the 24-month period, both the intervention and TAU groups had significant reductions in tobacco and cocaine use. Conclusions The intervention, compared with TAU, did not result in greater improvements in many of the selected cardiovascular risk factors. Since the study took place in a service-rich city with a range of pre-existing supportive services and universal health insurance, the high level of usual services available to the TAU group may have contributed to reductions in their cardiovascular disease risk factors. Further research is needed to develop interventions to reduce risk factors of cardiovascular disease among people experiencing homelessness and mental illness beyond existing treatments.

T1  - Is a new structurally dispossessed class developing in the United States?.

N2  - This study inquires whether a new structurally dispossessed class is developing in the United States. The new class proposition is derived from social theory and operationalized by two empirical characteristics: not in the labor force (NILF) and family income below poverty. The primary data source is the Current Population Survey over the years from 1968 to 2018, and threshold demographic criteria for class development is specified as increasing size and diversity. Because evidence is found to support the latter criterion but not the former, the proposition that a new class is developing is partially rejected. The analysis finds that new social components are joining the NILF/impoverished including men, Hispanics, college graduates, and young adults. Second, that the NILF/impoverished are politically active in terms of electoral participation, and no more likely than the total electorate to have voted for a populist Presidential candidate in 2016. NILF/impoverished recipiency of state transfers varies over time, increasing through the Great Recession, then receding. The implications of the investigation are discussed in terms of the likelihood that the NILF/impoverished will generate new forms of political opposition to the rule of capital.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This paper compares the accuracy of predicting suicide from Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) or history of illness., POPULATION STUDIED: 5 313 965 Veterans who at least had two primary care visits between 2008 and 2016., STUDY DESIGN: The dependent variable was suicide or intentional self-injury. The independent variables were 10 495 International Classification of Disease (ICD) Version 9 codes, age, and gender. The ICD codes included 40 V-codes used for measuring SDoH, such as family disruption, family history of substance abuse, lack of education, legal impediments, social isolation, unemployment, and homelessness. The sample was randomly divided into training (90 percent) and validation (10 percent) sets. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AROC) was used to measure accuracy of predictions in the validation set., PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Separate analyses were done for inpatient and outpatient codes; the results were similar. In the hospitalized group, the mean age was 67.2 years, and 92.1 percent were male. The mean number of medical diagnostic codes during the study period was 37; and 12.9 percent had at least one SDoH V-code. At least one episode of suicide or intentional self-injury occurred in 1.89 percent of cases. SDoH V-codes, on average, elevated the risk of suicide or intentional self-injury by 24-fold (ranging from 4- to 86-fold). An index of 40 SDoH codes predicted suicide or intentional self-injury with an AROC of 0.64. An index of 10 445 medical diagnoses, without SDoH V-codes, had AROC of 0.77. The combined SDoH and medical diagnoses codes also had AROC of 0.77., CONCLUSION: In predicting suicide or intentional self-harm, SDoH V-codes add negligible information beyond what is already available in medical diagnosis codes., IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Policies that affect SDoH (eg, housing policies, resilience training) may not have an impact on suicide rates, if they do not change the underlying medical causes of SDoH.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine how state guidance documents address equity concerns in K-12 schools during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic., STUDY DESIGN: Using online searches, we collected state-level documents from all 50 states and the District of Columbia discussing reopening plans for K-12 schools in the 2020-2021 academic year. We examined whether these documents explicitly mentioned equity as a concern, as well as if and how they addressed the following equity issues: food insecurity and child nutrition, homelessness or temporary housing, lack of access to Internet/technology, students with disabilities or special needs, English-language learners, students involved with or on the verge of involvement with the Department of Children and Family Services or an equivalent agency, mental health support, students/staff at greater risk of severe illness from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and students/staff living with someone at greater risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection., RESULTS: Forty-four of 51 states (86%) explicitly mentioned equity as a concern or guiding principle. At least 90% of states offered guidance for 7 equity issues. Fewer than 75% of states addressed homelessness or temporary housing, students involved with or on the verge of involvement with Department of Children and Family Services or an equivalent agency, and students/staff living with someone at greater risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection., CONCLUSIONS: Wide variability exists in state-level guidance to help K-12 schools develop reopening plans that protect those who are most vulnerable to learning loss or reduced access to basic needs. Interpretation and implementation by local educational agencies will need to be assessed. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: People living in temporary housing for long periods after a disaster are at risk of poor mental health. This study investigated the post-disaster incidence and remission of common mental disorders among adults living in temporary housing for the 3 years following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake., METHODS: Three years after the disaster, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 1089 adult residents living in temporary housing in the disaster area, i.e., the shelter group, and a random sample of 852 community residents from non-disaster areas of East Japan. The World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to diagnose DSM-IV mood, anxiety, and alcohol use disorders. Information on demographic variables and disaster experiences was also collected., RESULTS: Response rates were 49 and 46% for the shelter group and the community residents, respectively. The incidence of mood/anxiety disorder in the shelter group was elevated only in the first year post-disaster compared to that of the general population. The rate of remission for mood and anxiety disorders was significantly lower in the shelter group than in the community residents. The proportion seeking medical treatment was higher in the shelter group., CONCLUSIONS: The onset of common mental disorders increased in the first year, but then levelled off in the following years among residents in temporary housing after the disaster. Remission from incident post-disaster mental disorders was slower in the shelter group than in the general population. Post-disaster mental health service could consider the greater incidence in the first year and prolonged remission of mental disorders among survivors with a long-term stay in temporary housing after a disaster.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study provides information on how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is affecting emerging adults currently or recently homeless in terms of engagement in protective behaviors, mental health, substance use, and access to services., METHODS: Ninety participants in an ongoing clinical trial of a risk reduction program for homeless, aged 18-25 years, were administered items about COVID-19 between April 10 and July 9, 2020., RESULTS: Most participants reported engaging in COVID-19 protective behaviors. Past week mental health symptoms were reported by 38%-48% of participants, depending on symptoms. Among those who used substances before the outbreak, 16%-28% reported increased use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. More than half of the participants reported increased difficulty meeting basic needs (e.g., food), and approximately 32%-44% reported more difficulty getting behavioral health services since the outbreak., CONCLUSIONS: Innovative strategies are needed to address the increased behavioral health needs of young people experiencing homelessness during events such as the COVID-19 outbreak.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Young people experiencing homelessness have alarmingly high rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use, which is associated with sexual risk behaviors such as unprotected sex, trading sex, and sex with multiple casual partners. Few risk reduction programs for this population have been developed and rigorously evaluated, particularly those that address both of these interrelated behaviors, use a collaborative and non-judgmental approach, and are feasible to deliver in settings where homeless young people seek services. This paper describes the protocol of a study evaluating a four-session Motivational Interviewing (MI)-based group risk reduction intervention for this population. The protocol has been shown to be efficacious in pilot work over 3 months with 200 homeless young adults [1]. The current study seeks to refine the intervention protocol and evaluate the program on a larger scale., METHODS/DESIGN: In a cluster-cross-over randomized controlled trial, 18-25 year olds will receive the AWARE risk reduction program (n = 200) or standard care (n = 200) at one of three drop-in centers serving homeless youth in the Los Angeles area. We will evaluate intervention effects on primary outcomes of AOD use and sexual risk behavior, as well as secondary outcomes of health-related quality of life and social stability, over a 12-month period., DISCUSSION: This project has the potential to fill a significant gap in prevention services by demonstrating that a brief intervention, feasible to deliver within settings where young people experiencing homelessness typically seeks services, can significantly reduce the interrelated problems of AOD use and sexual risk behavior.

N2  - Interventionists often prioritize quantitative evaluation criteria such as design (e.g., randomized controlled trials), delivery fidelity, and outcome effects to assess the success of an intervention. Albeit important, criteria such as these obscure other key metrics of success such as the role of the interactions between participants and intervention deliverers, or contextual factors that shape an intervention's activities and outcomes. In line with advocacy to expand evaluation criteria for health interventions, we designed this qualitative study to examine how a subsample of Black men in MEN Count, an HIV/STI risk reduction and healthy relationship intervention with employment and housing stability case management for Black men in Washington, DC, defined the intervention's success. We also examined the contextual factors that shaped participation in the study's peer counseling sessions. We conducted structured interviews with 38 Black men, ages 18 to 60 years (M = 31.1, SD = 9.33) who completed at least one of three peer counseling sessions. Analyses highlighted three key themes: (a) the favorable impact of Mr. Stroman, the lead peer counselor, on participants' willingness to participate in MEN Count and disclose their challenges-we dubbed this the "Stroman Effect"; (b) the importance of Black men intervention deliverers with relatable life experiences; and (c) how contextual factors such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic, needs for housing and employment services and safe spaces to talk about challenges, and absentee fathers shaped participation. We discuss the study's implications for sustainable programs after funding ends and future multilevel health interventions to promote health equity for poor urban Black men.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess relationships between material hardships, shortened sleep duration, and suboptimal sleep practices across infancy and toddlerhood in low-income Hispanic families., METHODS: We analyzed longitudinal data of 451 low-income Hispanic mother-child pairs from a child obesity prevention trial. During infancy and toddlerhood, we used adjusted linear regression to assess associations between material hardship (financial difficulty, food insecurity, housing disrepair, and multiple hardships), sleep duration (24-hour, night), and the number of suboptimal sleep practices (eg, later bedtime, co-sleeping). We used adjusted linear regression to assess the longitudinal association between the number of suboptimal sleep practices in infancy and toddlerhood, and tested whether specific or multiple hardships moderated this association., RESULTS: In infants, financial difficulty and multiple hardships were associated with decreased night sleep (B=-0.59 hours, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.04, -0.14; and B=-0.54 hours, 95% CI: -1.00, -0.08). Housing disrepair was associated with decreased 24-hour sleep (B=-0.64 hours, 95% CI: -1.29, -0.01). In toddlers, each additional suboptimal sleep practice was associated with a decrease in night sleep (B=-0.19 hours, 95% CI: -0.29, -0.09). Each additional suboptimal sleep practice in infancy was associated with a 0.30 increase in the number of suboptimal sleep practices in toddlerhood (P < .001), with greater increases for those with food insecurity or multiple hardships., CONCLUSION: Specific and multiple hardships shortened sleep duration during infancy, and moderated the increase of suboptimal sleep behaviors between infancy and toddlerhood. Future studies should consider these early critically sensitive periods for interventions to mitigate material hardships and establish healthy sleep practices.

N2  - Despite many similarities, there are key differences in the ability of providers in the United States to assist homeless youth compared to their colleagues in the United Kingdom. However, legislation, and strategies to identify and advocate for youth experiencing homelessness can lead to improved health outcomes and other psychosocial improvements for youth. This article highlights, compares and contrasts the systems with a goal of greater understanding and opportunities to assist youth experiencing homelessness in either country.

N2  - Economic vulnerability, such as homelessness and unemployment, contributes to HIV risk among U.S. racial minorities. Yet, few economic-strengthening interventions have been adapted for HIV prevention in this population. This study assessed the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial of a 20-week microenterprise intervention for economically-vulnerable African-American young adults. Engaging MicroenterprisE for Resource Generation and Health Empowerment (EMERGE) aimed to reduce sexual risk behaviors and increase employment and uptake of HIV preventive behaviors. The experimental group received text messages on job openings plus educational sessions, mentoring, a start-up grant, and business and HIV prevention text messages. The comparison group received text messages on job openings only. Primary feasibility objectives assessed recruitment, randomization, participation, and retention. Secondary objectives examined employment, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV preventive behaviors. Outcome assessments used an in-person pre- and post-intervention interview and a weekly text message survey. Several progression criteria for a definitive trial were met. Thirty-eight participants were randomized to experimental (n = 19) or comparison group (n = 19) of which 95% were retained. The comparison intervention enhanced willingness to be randomized and reduced non-participation. Mean age of participants was 21.0 years; 35% were male; 81% were unemployed. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of experimental participants completed >= 70% of intervention activities, and 74% completed >= 50% of intervention activities. Participation in intervention activities and outcome assessments was highest in the first half (~ 10 weeks) of the study. Seventy-one percent (71%) of weekly text message surveys received a response through week 14, but responsiveness declined to 37% of participants responding to >= 70% of weekly text message surveys at the end of the study. The experimental group reported higher employment (from 32% at baseline to 83% at week 26) and lower unprotected sex (79% to 58%) over time compared to reported changes in employment (37% to 47%) and unprotected sex (63% to 53%) over time in the comparison group. Conducting this feasibility trial was a critical step in the process of designing and testing a behavioral intervention. Development of a fully-powered effectiveness trial should take into account lessons learned regarding intervention duration, screening, and measurement.Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We examined associations between household food insecurity status and parental feeding behavior, weight perception, and child weight status in a diverse sample of young children., METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 2-year-old children in Greenlight, a cluster randomized trial to prevent childhood obesity. The exposure was food insecurity, defined as a positive response to a validated screen. Outcomes were parent feeding behaviors/beliefs measured by the Child Feeding Questionnaire and child weight status. t tests and linear regression were used to assess associations between food insecurity and each outcome. We adjusted for child sex, race/ethnicity, parent education, employment, site, number of children in the home, and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children status., RESULTS: Five hundred three households (37%) were food insecure. After adjusting for covariates, parents from insecure households reported more pressuring feeding behaviors (mean factor score 3.2 compared to food secure parents mean factor score 2.9, P = .01) and were more worried about their child becoming overweight (mean factor score 2.3 vs 2.0; P = .02). No differences were observed in monitoring or restrictive feeding behaviors. After adjusting for covariates, there was no difference in weight status or prevalence of overweight/obesity of children or parents based on household food insecurity status., CONCLUSIONS: Parents from food insecure households reported more pressuring feeding behaviors. This finding underscores the need to address food insecurity and potentially prevent harmful effects on child feeding. Parents in food insecure households might benefit from linkage with resources and education to develop healthier feeding behaviors. Copyright © 2020 Academic Pediatric Association.

N2  - We conducted a mixed-methods, formative evaluation of a peer-led parenting intervention for homeless families. Participants were parents living in temporary accommodation with self-identified difficulties related to parenting an index child aged 2-11 years. An evidence-based programme ('Empowering Parents, Empowering Communities') was adapted for delivery with the target population in London, UK. We assessed feasibility in terms of session attendance rate, intervention completion rate and potential for impact on a range of parent-reported outcomes measures. Acceptability and appropriateness were examined by a user satisfaction measure and qualitative interviews. The intervention was delivered across three group cohorts (N = 15). Thirteen parents completed the programme (including one parent who required two attempts). We found improvements in child behavioural difficulties, parenting knowledge and practices, while parental well-being and social support were unchanged. Participants were highly satisfied overall, with indications that the peer-led model mitigated negative expectancies of services and normalized experiences of parenting in challenging conditions. Parental self-care and 'the good enough parent' were strongly endorsed topics, although some content (e.g. timeout) was deemed impractical. These promising findings warrant further testing under controlled conditions.

N2  - Posttraumatic stress symptoms are a pressing issue among women experiencing incarceration and homelessness. Baseline data were collected among formerly incarcerated homeless women (N = 130) who were on average 38.9 (SD = 11.36, range 19-64) years of age and recruited into a pilot randomized control trial (RCT) intervention program. A logistic regression was used to assess correlates of PTSD symptoms. The majority of the sample self-reported witnessing violence (85%) and had moderate PTSD symptoms (M = 1.61, SD = 1.62, range: 0-4). No past month drug use (p = 0.006), higher anger scores (p = 0.002), greater emotional support (p = 0.009), and psychological frailty (p = 0.02) were significantly associated with higher odds of PTSD symptoms. Moreover, women who experienced minor family conflicts had lower odds of PTSD symptoms relative to those that had family conflicts most of the time (p = 0.02). Similarly, controlling for all other variables, women who had a higher positive social interaction score also had lower odds of PTSD symptoms (p = 0.006). These findings are a call to action for academicians, service providers, and health practitioners to develop an intervention which integrates comprehensive PTSD screening, and discussion of ways to build coping skills, relationships with family and social networks, and utilizes a trauma-informed approach during reentry.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Illicit drug use in adolescence has been linked to drug use and poor mental health in adult life, but few studies have examined the relation between adult economic and criminal justice outcomes., METHODS: We analysed data from 14 082 participants (6999 women) in the 1970 British Birth Cohort Study. Illicit drug use over study members' lifetime and in the past year were self-reported at 16 years of age. Thirteen outcomes were self-reported at 30 years of age, including illicit drug use, smoking, problems with alcohol, mental and physical health, experience of socioeconomic disadvantage and experiences with the criminal justice system., RESULTS: At 16 years of age, 20.3% of the participants had ever tried an illicit drug and 7.2% had used in the past year. After adjustment for childhood socioeconomic status and mental health problems, and following correction for multiple testing, there was a dose-response association between illicit drug use at 16 years with illicit drug use in adult life in the past year (OR; 95% CI - 1.83, 1.51 to 3.12), experiencing homelessness (1.74, 1.16 to 2.62), being arrested (1.57, 1.29 to 1.92) and cautioned (1.97, 1.50 to 2.57) by the police, and being found guilty at court (1.73, 1.34 to 2.23)., CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent drug use was associated with an array of social and criminal outcomes in later life.

T1  - Demeaning: Dehumanizing others by minimizing the importance of their psychological needs.
A1  - Schroeder, Juliana
A1  - Epley, Nicholas
Y1  - 2020//
Y2  - 20200504//
N2  - We document a tendency to demean others' needs: believing that psychological needs-those requiring mental capacity, and hence more uniquely human (e.g., need for meaning and autonomy)-are relatively less important to others compared with physical needs-those shared with other biological agents, and hence more animalistic (e.g., need for food and sleep). Because valuing psychological needs requires a sophisticated humanlike mind, agents presumed to have relatively weaker mental capacities should also be presumed to value psychological needs less compared with biological needs. Supporting this, our studies found that people demeaned the needs of nonhuman animals (e.g., chimpanzees) and historically dehumanized groups (e.g., drug addicts) more than the needs of close friends or oneself (Studies 1 and 3). Because mental capacities are more readily recognized through introspection than by external observation, people also demean peers' needs more than their own, inferring that one's own behavior is guided more strongly by psychological needs than identical behavior in others (Study 4). Two additional experiments suggest that demeaning could be a systematic error (Studies 5 and 6), as charity donors and students underestimated the importance of homeless people's psychological (vs. physical) needs compared with self-reports and choices from homeless people. Underestimating the importance of others' psychological needs could impair the ability to help others. These experiments indicate that demeaning is a unique facet of dehumanization reflecting a reliable, consequential, and potentially mistaken understanding of others' minds.

N2  - Little is known regarding the specific types of service models and collaborations that are necessary to support diverse populations of youth in transition out of homelessness. Transitional supports addressing the complex needs of this population are needed to stabilize the array of housing arrangements that youth access. This study was a pilot randomized controlled trial of one such critical time intervention, called the Housing Outreach Program-Collaboration (HOP-C). HOP-C is a multicomponent, multidisciplinary intervention that provides 6 months of mental health and peer support, along with transitional case management to youth who have transitioned into some form of stable housing out of homelessness. In this trial, 65 youth were randomized to receive HOP-C plus treatment as usual or transitional case management plus treatment as usual. Outcome assessments were completed by 30 treatment and 28 control participants. The findings suggest that this intervention is feasible with mental health, employment or education, and housing metrics favoring HOP-C with odds ratios ranging from 2.28 to 3.18 and better subjective housing stability. Other indicators showed less change. HOP-C appears feasible and should be tested in a fully powered trial, providing the intervention for a duration longer than 6 months. Overall, these data suggest the potential benefit in fostering city-level, multidisciplinary teams sourced from several organizations to support youth transitioning out of homelessness. Pragmatic trial method considerations for this population are also addressed as are the ethical considerations pertinent to engaging highly marginalized youth in clinical trials.

N2  - The effects of housing instability and homelessness on child and adult health are well documented. However, few studies have explored health and housing interventions for families with children with the objective of health improvement. Housing Prescriptions as Health Care is a randomized controlled trial that is investigating the impact on physical and mental health of integrating priority placement in affordable housing and the provision of services (case management, financial, and legal), compared to the standard of care (providing resource guides and hospital-based social work or care navigation services). In 2016-19 seventy-eight homeless or housing-unstable families defined as "medically complex"-with a child or adult member who used more health services than usual or had a chronic disease or disability-were enrolled in the trial, and sixty-seven completed a six-month follow-up. A difference-in-differences analysis at six months showed decreases in the share of children in fair or poor health and in average anxiety and depression scores among parents in the intervention group, relative to the control group. Findings suggest that a population-specific model that integrates health, housing, legal, and social services can improve health-related outcomes at the household level.

N2  - Homeless young adults are more likely than their never-homeless counterparts to abuse substances and engage in sexual risk behaviors. This study evaluated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of OnTrack, a smartphone application to self-monitor substance use and sexual risk behaviors, plus a brief motivational intervention (BMI), in reducing substance use and sexual risk among homeless young adults. A randomized controlled pilot trial (N = 60) compared OnTrack + BMI to treatment as usual (TAU) at an inner-city crisis shelter for homeless young adults (aged 18-21 years). Participants were assessed at baseline and 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks after baseline to evaluate substance use and sexual risk behaviors. Kruskal-Wallis tests determined differences between baseline and postintervention assessments. Logistic regression models examined treatment effect on change in outcomes between baseline and postintervention follow-up assessment, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in OnTrack + BMI significantly reduced past 2-week number of drinks (p = .023), times used marijuana (p = .046), times engaged in unprotected sex (p = .012), and times used drugs before sexual activity (p = .019). No reductions of substance use or sexual risk behaviors were found among participants in TAU (all ps > .05). After adjusting for baseline levels of substance use and sexual risk, participants in OnTrack + BMI had significantly lower odds than those in TAU for drinking alcohol (adjusted OR = 0.14; p = .01) and having unprotected sex (adjusted OR = 0.151; p = .032). OnTrack + BMI is feasible and effective in reducing past 2-week alcohol use and unprotected sex among homeless young adults. A larger randomized trial is warranted to replicate and extend present results. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Adverse childhood experiences are known risk factors for a range of social, economic, and health-related outcomes over the life course. Resilience is a known protective factor. This study examines the associations of adverse childhood experiences and resilience with poor mental health outcomes among homeless adults with mental illness., METHODS: This study utilized data from 565 homeless adults with mental illness participating in a Housing First intervention in Toronto (2009-2013) to evaluate their sociodemographic characteristics, adverse childhood experience exposure, resilience, and mental health outcomes. Descriptive statistics were generated, and logistic regression models were used to examine the association of total adverse childhood experience score and resilience with poor mental health outcomes. Analyses were conducted in 2019., RESULTS: The average total adverse childhood experience score was 4.1 (SD=2.8) among all study participants. Individuals with a lifetime duration of homelessness exceeding 36 months (p=0.011) had higher mean scores. Total score was positively associated with several mental illness diagnoses and psychopathology severity, indicated by co-occurring mental illness diagnoses (AOR=1.23, 95% CI=1.13, 1.33) and high Colorado Symptom Index scores (AOR=1.26, 95% CI=1.14, 1.38). Resilience served as a protective factor against several individual mental illness diagnoses, co-occurring mental illness diagnoses (AOR=0.85, 95% CI=0.76, 0.95), and high Colorado Symptom Index scores (AOR=0.69, 95% CI=0.61, 0.79)., CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the high prevalence of adverse childhood experiences and their negative impact on homeless adults with mental illness. Resilience protects against adverse childhood experience-associated poor mental health outcomes, thereby serving as a potential interventional target in homeless populations.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Evidence from randomized controlled trials establishes that medication treatment with methadone and buprenorphine reduces opioid use and improves treatment retention. However, little is known about the role of such medications compared with non-medication treatments in mitigating overdose risk among US patient populations receiving treatment in usual care settings. This study compared overdose mortality among those in medication versus non-medication treatments in specialty care settings., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using state-wide treatment data linked to death records. Survival analysis was used to analyze data in a time-to-event framework., SETTING: Services delivered by 757 providers in publicly funded out-patient specialty treatment programs in Maryland, USA between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2016., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 48 274 adults admitted to out-patient specialty treatment programs in 2015-16 for primary diagnosis of opioid use disorder., MEASUREMENTS: Main exposure was time in medication treatment (methadone/buprenorphine), time following medication treatment, time exposed to non-medication treatments and time following non-medication treatment. Main outcome was opioid overdose death during and after treatment. Hazard ratios were calculated using Cox proportional hazard regression. Propensity score weights were adjusted for patient information on sex, age, race, region of residence, marital and veteran status, employment, homelessness, primary opioid, mental health treatment, arrests and criminal justice referral., FINDINGS: The study population experienced 371 opioid overdose deaths. Periods in medication treatment were associated with substantially reduced hazard of opioid overdose death compared with periods in non-medication treatment [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.08-0.40]. Periods after discharge from non-medication treatment (aHR = 5.45, 95% CI = 2.80-9.53) and medication treatment (aHR = 5.85, 95% CI = 3.10-11.02) had similar and substantially elevated risks compared with periods in non-medication treatments., CONCLUSIONS: Among Maryland patients in specialty opioid treatment, periods in treatment are protective against overdose compared with periods out of care. Methadone and buprenorphine are associated with significantly lower overdose death compared with non-medication treatments during care but not after treatment is discontinued.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is much more prevalent among young people experiencing homelessness than in the general population of adolescents and young adults. Although many young homeless smokers are motivated to quit, there are no empirically-evaluated smoking cessation programs for this population. It is important that any such program address the factors known to be associated with quitting-related outcomes among homeless young people, to provide ongoing support in a way that accommodates the mobility of this population, and does not rely on scarce service provider resources for its delivery. The objective of this project is to develop and pilot test a text messaging-based intervention (TMI), as an adjunct to brief cessation counseling and provision of nicotine patches, to help homeless young people who want to quit smoking., METHODS/DESIGN: This pilot study will utilize a cluster cross-over randomized controlled design with up to 80 current smokers who desire to quit and are recruited from three drop-in centers serving young people experiencing homelessness in the Los Angeles area. All participants will be provided with a minimum standard of care: a 30-min group-based smoking cessation counseling session and free nicotine replacement. Half of these smokers will then also receive the TMI, as an adjunct to this standard care, which will provide 6 weeks of ongoing support for quitting. This support includes continued and more intensive education regarding nicotine dependence, quitting smoking, and relapse; does not require additional agency resources; can be available "on demand" to users; and includes features to personalize the quitting experience. This study will investigate whether receiving the TMI adjunct to standard smoking cessation care results in greater reductions in cigarette smoking compared to standard care alone over a 3-month period., DISCUSSION: This study has the potential to address an important gap in the clinical research literature on cigarette smoking cessation and provide empirical support for using a TMI to provide ongoing assistance and support for quitting among young smokers experiencing homelessness.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Car accidents due to unexpected forward or backward runaway by older drivers are a serious social problem. Although the cause of these accidents is often attributed to stepping on the accelerator instead of the brake, it is difficult to induce such pedal application errors systematically with usual drive simulators. We developed a simple personal computer system that induces the pedal errors, and investigate the effects of age on the error behaviors., METHODS: The system consisted of a laptop computer and a three-pedal foot mouse. It measured response time, accuracy, and flexibility of pedal operation to visual stimuli. The system displayed two open circles on the computer display, lighting one of the circles in a random order and interval. Subjects were instructed to press the foot pedal with their right foot as quickly as possible when the circle was lit; the ipsilateral pedal to the lit circle in a parallel mode and the contralateral pedal in a cross mode. When the correct pedal was pressed, the light went off immediately, but when the wrong pedal was pressed, the buzzer sounded and the light remained on until the correct pedal was pressed. During a 6-min trial, the mode was switched between parallel and cross every 2 min. During the cross mode, a cross mark appears on the display. The pedal responses were evaluated in 52 subjects divided into young (20-29 years), middle-aged (30-64 years), and older (65-84 years) groups. Additionally, the repeatability of the pedal response characteristic indicators was examined in 14 subjects who performed this test twice., RESULTS: The mean response time was 95 ms (17%) longer in the older group than in the young group. More characteristically, however, the older group showed 2.1 times more frequent pedal errors, fell into long hesitations (response freezing > 3 s) 16 times more often, and took 1.8 times longer period to correct the wrong pedal than the young groups. The indicators of pedal response characteristics showed within-individual repeatability to the extent that can identify the age-dependent changes., CONCLUSIONS: Hesitations and extended error correction time can be associated with increased crash risk due to unexpected runaway by older drivers. The system we have developed may help to uncover and evaluate physiological characteristics related to crash risk in the elderly population.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The TIP (Traumatic Injury Prevention) Project evaluated the impact on post-injury drug use of two brief motivational interventions compared to brief advice (BA) among injured patients who use drugs., METHOD: Three-group, single blind, randomized controlled trial in a Level 1Trauma Center enrolled 395 admitted patients with drug positive toxicology screen or verbal report of drug use in the previous 30 days. 34% were Hispanic, 45% non-Hispanic White, 16% non-Hispanic Black. 88% smoked marijuana, 28% used cocaine and 11% prescription opioids. Brief Advice (BA) provided advice to abstain from drugs, educational materials and referral to community resources. Brief Motivational Intervention (BMI) additionally included a 30-45 minute session, with assessment feedback, based on motivational interviewing. BMI + B included a telephone booster 4-weeks post-intervention. Drug use as measured by percent days abstinent and total abstinence, derived from the Timeline Follow back was the primary outcome., RESULTS: A significant reduction from baseline was observed at 3, 6, and 12 months in the primary outcomes of any drug use (excluding alcohol); cannabis and cocaine, the most frequently used drugs, were analyzed individually. There were no between group differences or group X time interactions. Similarly, there were no between groups differences on secondary outcomes including perceived health status, re-injury, arrest, incarceration, alcohol and drug treatment, employment, AA attendance, homelessness, physical abuse, and problems associated with alcohol and drug use., CONCLUSIONS: The study does not support use of these enhanced motivational interventions over brief advice for trauma patients with a positive screen for drug use.

N2  - Policing is an important structural determinant of HIV and other health risks faced by vulnerable populations, including people who sell sex and use drugs, though the role of routine police encounters is not well understood. Given the influence of policing on the risk environment of these groups, methods of measuring the aggregate impact of routine policing practices are urgently required. We developed and validated a novel, brief scale to measure police patrol practices (Police Practices Scale, PPS) among 250 street-based female sex workers (FSW) in Baltimore, Maryland, an urban setting with high levels of illegal drug activity. PPS items were developed from existing theory and ethnography with police and their encounters with FSW, and measured frequency of recent (past 3 months) police encounters. The 6-item scale was developed using exploratory factor analysis after examining the properties of the original 11 items. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to model the factor structure. A 2-factor model emerged, with law enforcement PPS items and police assistance PPS items loading on separate factors. Linear regression models were used to explore the relative distribution of these police encounters among FSW by modeling association with key socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics of the sample. Higher exposure to policing was observed among FSW who were homeless (beta = 0.71, p = 0.037), in daily sex work (beta = 1.32, p = 0.026), arrested in the past 12 months (beta = 1.44, p<0.001) or injecting drugs in the past 3 months (beta = 1.04, p<0.001). The PPS provides an important and novel contribution in measuring aggregate exposure to routine policing, though further validation is required. This scale could be used to evaluate the impact of policing on vulnerable populations' health outcomes, including HIV risk.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Limited research has evaluated the efficacy of suicide prevention interventions among homeless youth, especially considering how their connectedness with their family would impact treatment outcomes., METHOD: Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) between the ages of 18-24 years were recruited from a local drop-in center. Youth were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or Treatment as Usual alone. Youth reported their family network satisfaction at the baseline assessment, whereas their suicidal ideation, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness were assessed at baseline and three additional times during a nine-month period., RESULTS: A multiple-group autoregressive cross-lagged model suggests that CTSP was associated with lower suicidal ideation and lower thwarted belongingness only among those with high family network satisfaction. Among both groups, perceived burdensomeness predicted higher suicidal ideation, which in turn predicted lower perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. Additionally, only among youth with low family network satisfaction, thwarted belongingness predicted lower suicidal ideation., CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that family network satisfaction may be an important factor when considering cognitive interventions with homeless youth, with implications to improve treatment efforts and to reduce premature mortality, hospitalization and loss of human capital in a very high-risk population.

N2  - Research related to absconding and its associated risks is limited in relation to inpatients from private psychiatric units. This study aimed to compare patients who abscond from public and private psychiatric inpatient settings. Demographic data was collated on the subjects (n = 214) who all had a history of absconding. Public absconders (n = 159) were more likely to have a psychotic illness, increased number of psychiatric diagnoses, history of aggression, substance use and homelessness, when compared to private absconders. Predictors identified for private absconders (n = 55) were female gender and fewer drugs used. This study has implications for the different profiles of absconders between the public and private settings.

N2  -  Introduction:  Alaska Native communities experience high rates of alcohol and substance abuse and face challenges accessing quality, culturally appropriate treatment. Telepsychiatry could help bridge this gap, but no publications have examined its impacts for alcohol and substance abuse treatment directed at Alaska Native communities. This study explores one telepsychiatry clinic's impact on a residential substance abuse treatment serving the Alaska Native community in Anchorage, Alaska.  Methods:  Using a matched case - control design, 103 cases receiving telepsychiatry services between 2007 and 2012 were matched with 103 controls who did not. Outcome measures included length of stay, discharge plans, emergency room visits, and hospital admissions; clinical history, including previous suicide attempts, history of violence, and trauma history; social stressors such as current legal issues, unemployment, and homelessness; mental health, medical, and substance abuse diagnoses; and number of telepsychiatry appointments and nature of telepsychiatry services rendered.  Results:  Both groups exhibited high rates of mental and medical illness, socioeconomic challenges, and substance abuse. However, the telepsychiatry group demonstrated a significantly higher rate of post-traumatic stress disorder, history of violence, ongoing legal issues, and children in outside custody. It also remained engaged in treatment longer, had fewer discharges against medical advice, and was more likely to complete treatment.  Discussion/Conclusions:  Our study highlights this telepsychiatry clinic's real-world difference serving the complex substance abuse treatment needs of Alaska Native individuals. It also reinforces telepsychiatry's promise in serving other communities facing a high burden of addiction and mental illness yet facing barriers to high-quality, culturally competent services.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study explored factors associated with attrition of vulnerable women from a community-based, longitudinal mental health intervention study., DESIGN: The study employed a quasi-experimental, nonequivalent comparison group pretest-posttest design. The intervention consisted of six, 90-min meetings featuring education and support., SAMPLE: One hundred and eighteen women aged 18-88 years enrolled from four urban neighborhoods., MEASUREMENTS: The team used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Primary Health Questionnaire-9, a self-care knowledge for anxiety and depression instrument, and demographics to measure variables., INTERVENTION: Sessions occurred at trusted neighborhood sites. The team provided transportation, child care, and reminder calls or texts. Community health workers actively encouraged participants to continue in the study. The researchers did not offer financial incentives. Completion of the intervention involved attending four of six sessions., RESULTS: The study had a 39% attrition rate. Results , using a Chi-square test for independence, indicated significant associations between attrition, neighborhood/homelessness, and family income. Additionally, there were significant associations between attrition, a past diagnosis of anxiety, and a lack of concurrent therapy for anxiety/depression., CONCLUSIONS: This study identified social determinants and mental health factors linked to the attrition of urban, ethnically diverse, and impoverished women from longitudinal intervention studies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Service centres for homeless adults are potential settings for implementation of reintegration interventions. This study aimed to evaluate (i) the acceptability of a group-based programme among individuals from the broad population of homeless people and (ii) if a future study of its feasibility and acceptability for re-housed homeless people is warranted., METHODS: Recruiting participants and intervention facilitators from partnering service centres was thought to improve recruitment and retention, cost-effectiveness and social interactions compared to professional-led interventions. Seven adults with experience of homelessness (three females, four males, mean age 39 years, range 18-63) were recruited to participate in the intervention. The research protocol comprised completion pre/post of scales [Recovering Quality of Life questionnaire; Working Alliance Inventory-short form revised (WAI-SR)] and focus groups, and WAI-SR and focus groups after sessions 3 and 6., RESULTS: The intervention and research protocols were feasible, with all participants engaging in all sessions, completing all scales and attending all focus groups. The quantitative data demonstrated the feasibility of obtaining practically useful measures of relevant outcomes. In the four focus groups, the intervention received very favourable feedback., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated initial feasibility and acceptability of an intervention that places minimal burden on infrastructure and promotes user autonomy. This is an important advance as there is increasing recognition that the challenge of reintegration is as much a psychological and social problem as a housing problem. If effective, this style of intervention may serve as a template for future interventions with similar populations. Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.

N2  - PURPOSE: Compare selected sociodemographic and sexual risk characteristics of black/African American (black) men who have sex with men only (MSMO) and men who have sex with men and women (MSMW) in the southeastern United States (the South)., METHODS: We conducted bivariate and multivariable analyses to explore the sociodemographic characteristics and sexual risk behaviors of 584 MSMW and MSMO in the South., RESULTS: MSMW had lesser odds of having a college or graduate degree (aOR = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.19, 0.54) and having > 2 male oral sex partners (aOR = 0.20; 95% CI = 0.08, 0.48) compared to MSMO. MSMW had greater odds of being homeless (aOR = 3.11; 95% CI = 1.80, 5.38) and selecting "top" sexual position (aOR = 1.70; 95% CI = 1.07, 2.72) compared to MSMO., CONCLUSION: MSMW in the South experience social and structural factors that may affect their risk for HIV infection. Strategies to address these factors should be considered in prevention and care efforts for this population.

N2  - Few studies have evaluated the impact of nutritional supplementation among pregnant adolescents. We examined the effects of the Rang Din Nutrition Study (RDNS) interventions on children born to mothers <20 years of age. The RDNS was a cluster-randomized effectiveness trial with four arms: (1) women and children both received small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS-LNS), (2) women received iron and folic acid (IFA) and children received LNS (IFA-LNS), (3) women received IFA and children received micronutrient powder (MNP) (IFA-MNP), and (4) women received IFA and children received no supplements (IFA-Control). We enrolled 4011 women at <20 weeks gestation; 1552 were adolescents. Among adolescents, prenatal LNS reduced newborn stunting by 25% and small head size by 28% and had a marginally significant effect on newborn wasting, compared with IFA. Low birth weight and preterm birth were reduced only among adolescents with lower food security. Effects on subsequent growth status were observed only among female children in the LNS-LNS group: less stunting at 18 months (versus IFA-MNP) and lower prevalence of small head circumference and wasting at 24 months (versus IFA-Control). Initiatives targeting pregnant adolescents in similar settings should consider inclusion of small-quantity LNS, particularly for adolescents living in food-insecure households.

N2  - AIM: No previous study has investigated interventions for homeless youth suffering from first episode psychosis and comorbid substance use disorder (HYPS). An intensive assertive community intervention team (IACIT) offering outreach interventions, housing support as well as integrated care for early psychosis and substance use disorder (SUD) was created in 2012 at the Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal (CHUM). To explore the impact of the addition of an IACIT to an early intervention for psychosis service (EIS) on housing stability, functional and symptomatic outcomes and mental health service use., METHODS: A two-year longitudinal study comparing the outcome of HYPS receiving combined EIS and IACIT since 2012, to a historical cohort of HYPS receiving EIS only between 2005 and 2011. Socio-demographic data, housing stability, functioning, illness severity, SUD severity, emergency room visits and hospitalizations were assessed at admission, at 1 month, and every 3 months thereafter., RESULTS: HYPS receiving EIS + IACIT achieved housing stability more rapidly and spent less time hospitalized than HYPS getting EIS only (RR 2.38, P = .017). HYPS with cocaine misuse were less likely to attain housing stability (RR 0.25, P = .04). No between-group differences were found for psychiatric symptoms, functioning and SUD outcomes., CONCLUSION: The addition of IACIT-HYPS to EIS was associated with earlier housing stability and reduced total hospitalization days compared to EIS alone.

N2  - Aims: Homelessness is associated with poor health outcomes and increased use of hospital and emergency department (ED) services. Little is known about the duration of homelessness in relation to health care service use. The aim of this study was to examine the use of hospital and ED services among the homeless in Helsinki, Finland, and for the first time, to examine the relationship between service use and duration of homelessness. Methods: Six hundred and eighty-three persons staying at least one night in a shelter between September 2009 and September 2010 were followed until the end of 2014. Using negative binominal regression analysis we calculated the use of hospital and ED services and compared the use with that of a matched control group (N = 1361). We also analyzed service use in relation to the time spent homeless during follow-up. Results: The mean time spent homeless during the follow-up was 8.5 months, one third was temporarily homeless (less than 2% of the follow-up time), but recurrent episodes of homelessness were also common. The study group's incidence rate ratios for medical-surgical hospital days was 6.23 (95% CI: 4.73 to 8.21), for psychiatric hospital days 43.11 (95% CI: 23.02 to 80.74) and for ED visits 10.21 (95% CI: 8.77 to 11.90), compared with controls. The number of medical-surgical hospital days and ED visits/person-year increased as homelessness was prolonged, but the pattern was opposite for psychiatric hospital days. Conclusions: Homeless persons are heavy users of hospital and ED services, and there is also increased use among those temporarily homeless.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Aim of this cluster randomized trial was to examine the impact of a school feeding programme combining healthy meals provision and educational activities to reduce food insecurity., METHODS: Schools participating in the DIATROFI Program in Greece during the 2014-2015 school year were randomly allocated between a multicomponent intervention (MI: each student received a daily healthy meal along with educational actions; 28 schools) and an educational intervention (EI; 23 schools). A linear-mixed model was used to examine intervention effect on change from baseline in the food insecurity score, as measured via the Food Security Survey Module (FSSM). The analysis was based on 1442 pre-post intervention questionnaire pairs in the MI group and 986 in the EI group., RESULTS: The reduction in food insecurity score in the MI group was statistically significantly greater compared to the EI group, by 9.8% or -0.31 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.61 to -0.01] FSSM units after adjusting for potential confounders. MI intervention was significantly more effective compared to EI, among students in food insecure households (mean -0.44, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.04), students in households facing hunger (mean -1.04, 95% CI -1.91 to -0.17) and overweight/obese students (mean -0.36, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.01)., CONCLUSION: For interventions aiming to address childhood food insecurity, public health focus should be oriented towards school-based programmes combining food assistance with activities that promote healthy nutrition.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Housing insecurity and homelessness contribute to risk of maltreatment among one in five of the nearly 3.5 million children annually investigated for maltreatment in the United States. The Family Unification Program (FUP)-a federal initiative-connects inadequately housed families involved in child welfare with long-term rental subsidies to avoid foster placement. However, FUP remains understudied and underutilized with funding levels that serve only a fraction of eligible households. The present study uses system dynamics modeling to inform decision-making by testing policies for scaling FUP., METHOD: Simulations model delivery of FUP within child welfare from a feedback perspective. Calibrated on national data, models replicate trends in child welfare involvement from 2013 through 2016, and analyses forecast rates through 2019. Experiments test policies that enhance FUP. Outcomes track system-wide rates of family separation and returns on investment of expanded housing interventions., RESULTS: Dramatic expansions of FUP benefit more families and improve marginal return on investment. Yet, scale-up fails to reduce system-wide rates of family separation or generates substantial cost-savings., CONCLUSIONS: Simulations demonstrate structural challenges for scaling FUP. Constant demand for affordable housing constrains sustainable improvements in child protection. Child welfare responses to homelessness require innovations that reduce demand for housing services through prevention and earlier intervention.

N2  - Objective: To examine diet quality and dietary intake among residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods in the Southeast United States (U.S.) and to examine associations between dietary and socioeconomic factors. Design: We examined baseline data from an evaluation study of a healthy food access initiative. Participants were recruited from two urban settings comprising seven neighborhoods of high household poverty (17% to 62%). Participants completed in-person interviews with measures of education, household income, and food security and one unannounced 24-hour dietary recall by telephone with trained registered dietitians. Food desert residence was coded based on U.S. Census data. Proportions meeting 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI-2010) scores were computed. Associations between dietary variables and participant's education, household income, food security, and food desert residence were tested. Results: Participants (n = 465) were predominantly African American (92%), women (80%), and overweight or obese (79%), and 52 +/- 14 years of age. Sixty-three percent had low or very low food security, and 82% lived in census tracts of low income and low access to supermarkets (urban food desert). HEI-2010 scores averaged 48.8 +/- 13.1. A minority of participants met dietary guidelines. Diet quality was lower among participants with lower education and among those from food insecure households (p < .05). Household income and food security were positively associated with meeting several dietary guidelines (p < .05). Food desert residence was unrelated to diet variables. Conclusions: In this disadvantaged population, significant nutritional concerns were observed, and socioeconomic factors were associated with diet quality and meeting dietary guidelines. Interventions must address broader economic, social, and policy issues such as access to affordable healthy foods.

N2  - BACKGROUND: While there is a growing interest in addressing social determinants of health in clinical settings, there are limited data on the relationship between unstable housing and both obstetric outcomes and health care utilization., OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the relationship between unstable housing, obstetric outcomes, and health care utilization after birth., STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study. Data were drawn from a database of liveborn neonates linked to their mothers' hospital discharge records (2007-2012) maintained by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. The analytic sample included singleton pregnancies with both maternal and infant data available, restricted to births between the gestational age of 20 and 44 weeks, who presented at a hospital that documented at least 1 woman as having unstable housing using the International Classification of Diseases, ninth edition, codes (n = 2,898,035). Infants with chromosomal abnormalities and major birth defects were excluded. Women with unstable housing (lack of housing or inadequate housing) were identified using International Classification of Diseases, ninth edition, codes from clinical records. Outcomes of interest included preterm birth (<37 weeks' gestational age), early term birth (37-38 weeks gestational age), preterm labor, preeclampsia, chorioamnionitis, small for gestational age, long birth hospitalization length of stay after delivery (vaginal birth, >2 days; cesarean delivery, >4 days), emergency department visit within 3 months and 1 year after delivery, and readmission within 3 months and 1 year after delivery. We used exact propensity score matching without replacement to select a reference population to compare with the sample of women with unstable housing using a one-to-one ratio, matching for maternal age, race/ethnicity, parity, prior preterm birth, body mass index, tobacco use during pregnancy, drug/alcohol abuse during pregnancy, hypertension, diabetes, mental health condition during pregnancy, adequacy of prenatal care, education, and type of hospital. Odds of an adverse obstetric outcome were estimated using logistic regression., RESULTS: Of 2794 women with unstable housing identified, 83.0% (n = 2318) had an exact propensity score-matched control. Women with an unstable housing code had higher odds of preterm birth (odds ratio, 1.2, 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.4, P < .05), preterm labor (odds ratio, 1.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.2-1.6, P < .001), long length of stay (odds ratio, 1.6, 95% confidence interval, 1.4-1.8, P < .001), emergency department visits within 3 months (odds ratio, 2.4, 95% confidence interval, 2.1-2.8, P < .001) and 1 year after birth (odds ratio, 2.7, 95% confidence interval, 2.4-3.0, P < .001), and readmission within 3 months (odds ratio, 2.7, 95% confidence interval, 2.2-3.4, P < .0014) and 1 year after birth (odds ratio, 2.6, 95% confidence interval, 2.2-3.0, P < .001)., CONCLUSION: Unstable housing documentation is associated with adverse obstetric outcomes and high health care utilization. Housing and supplemental income for pregnant women should be explored as a potential intervention to prevent preterm birth and prevent increased health care utilization.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The CTN-0067 CHOICES trial tests implementation of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) versus treatment-as-usual (TAU) for opioid use disorders (OUD) in HIV clinics to improve HIV viral suppression. The study team investigated recruitment strategies to elucidate the barriers and facilitators to recruitment and enrollment in the study., MAIN TEXT: Methods: Semi-structured, in-depth, digitally recorded interviews were completed with study recruitment-related staff and medical providers (n = 26) from six participating HIV clinics in the fall of 2018. Interviews probed 1) factors that might prevent prospective participants from engaging in study recruitment and enrollment procedures and 2) strategies used by study staff that encourage eligible patient participation. Interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed using a content analysis approach., RESULTS: All respondents reported that barriers to recruitment and enrollment included challenging patient social and structural factors (e.g., homelessness or living environments with high substance use, criminal justice involvement), difficulty locating patients with unsuppressed HIV viral load and OUD within the HIV clinic, time-consuming study enrollment processes, and stigma around HIV and OUD which inhibited treatment seeking. Some respondents observed that distrust of research and researchers impeded recruitment activities in the community. A specific medication-related barrier was patient fear of opioid abstinence required prior to XR-NTX induction. Facilitators of recruitment included use of trusted peer outreach/recruitment workers in the community, hospitalizations that offered windows of opportunities for screening and XR-NTX induction, providing participant transportation, and partnerships with harm reduction organizations for referrals., CONCLUSIONS: Though study personnel encountered barriers to recruitment in the CHOICES study, persons with untreated HIV and OUD can be enrolled in multisite clinical trials by using enhanced recruitment strategies that extend outside of the HIV clinic. Employing peer outreach workers and collaborating with syringe service programs may be especially helpful in facilitating recruitment and merit inclusion in similar study protocols.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Nowadays there are more than 5 millions of immigrants (8.3% of general adult population) in Italy., AIM: To evaluate the potential impact of immigration and the possession of a permanent residence on blood pressure (BP) levels and control in a low income population of immigrants from different countries., METHODS: We evaluated clinical characteristics and social status of adult individuals with known diagnosis of hypertension afferent to the Poliambulatorio della Caritas Diocesana in Rome, Italy, between 2010-2016. Subjects were stratified according to their macro-areas of origin (Europe, Asia, Africa, South-America), housing (with or without house), and immigration status (presence or absence of residence permit). BP levels were measured in three consecutive visits according to recommendations from current European Guidelines., RESULTS: From an overall population sample of 9827 adult individuals, we initially identified 994 patients with a diagnosis of hypertension (10.1%), among whom 536 (5.4%) had valid BP data. Among these, 50.6% came from Europe, 21.6% from Africa, 24.1% from Asia, and 3.7% from South-America. They were predominantly male (54.7%), middle aged (42.8 +/- 12.1 years at arrival and 51.6 +/- 10.6 years at first visit) and untreated (72.8%) individuals with baseline systolic/diastolic BP levels of 156.9 +/- 22.2/97.3 +/- 12.4 mmHg). BP levels remained higher in homeless than in housed people at both visit 2 (150.0 +/- 21.8/92.6 +/- 12.9 mmHg vs. 142.9 +/- 19.3/89.9 +/- 11.6 mmHg; P < 0.001) and visit 3 (147.9 +/- 22.2/91.7 +/- 12.5 mmHg vs. 141.8 +/- 19.4/89.2 +/- 12.0 mmHg; P = 0.013). We also observed reductions of both systolic and diastolic BP levels compared to baseline values in immigrants stratified according to residence permit, although without relevant differences among groups., CONCLUSIONS: Beyond conventional risk factors, socio-economic issues, including lack of residence permit or habitation, may affect BP levels and control in frail populations of immigrants, which have been marginally considered before.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Youth often experience unique pathways into homelessness, such as family conflict, child abuse and neglect. Most research has focused on adult homeless populations, yet youth have specific needs that require adapted interventions. This review aims to synthesize evidence on interventions for youth and assess their impacts on health, social, and equity outcomes., METHODS: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and other databases from inception until February 9, 2018 for systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials on youth interventions conducted in high income countries. We screened title and abstract and full text for inclusion, and data extraction were completed in duplicate, following the PRISMA-E (equity) review approach., RESULTS: Our search identified 11,936 records. Four systematic reviews and 18 articles on randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Many studies reported on interventions including individual and family therapies, skill-building, case management, and structural interventions. Cognitive behavioural therapy led to improvements in depression and substance use, and studies of three family-based therapies reported decreases in substance use. Housing first, a structural intervention, led to improvements in housing stability. Many interventions showed inconsistent results compared to services as usual or other interventions, but often led to improvements over time in both the intervention and comparison group. The equity analysis showed that equity variables were inconsistently measured, but there was data to suggest differential outcomes based upon gender and ethnicity., CONCLUSIONS: This review identified a variety of interventions for youth experiencing homelessness. Promising interventions include cognitive behavioural therapy for addressing depression, family-based therapy for substance use outcomes, and housing programs for housing stability. Youth pathways are often unique and thus prevention and treatment may benefit from a tailored and flexible approach.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that non-medical prescription opioid (NMPO) use may be a risk factor for initiating heroin use; however, pathways from PO to heroin use among youth remain underexplored. We sought to examine the association between NMPO use and heroin initiation., METHODS: Between September 2005 and June 2017 data were derived from an open prospective cohort of street-involved youth aged 14-28 who use illegal drugs in Vancouver, Canada. The study included 526 youth who had never used non-injection heroin, and 652 youth who had never used injection heroin at baseline. We used Cox proportional hazards regressions to examine the association between NMPO use - in addition to other substance use patterns - and subsequent initiation into non-injection and injection heroin use., RESULTS: Among those who had never used non-injection heroin at baseline, 133 (25.3%) initiated non-injection heroin use during the study period. Among those who had never injected heroin at baseline, 137 (21.0%) initiated heroin injection during the study period. In multivariable analyses, NMPO use, crack use, and crystal methamphetamine use predicted non-injection heroin initiation (all p<0.05). In separate multivariable analyses, non-injection heroin and crystal methamphetamine predicted heroin injection initiation (all p<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Among street-involved youth in this setting, NMPO use predicted initiation into non-injection heroin use but not initiation into heroin injection. Interestingly, crack cocaine and crystal methamphetamine use were stronger predictors of heroin initiation than NMPO use was, suggesting that stimulant use may carry greater risks for heroin initiation than NMPO use.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Food insecurity is an important public health problem facing children in the United States. Although a number of previous studies suggest that food insecurity has negative impacts on health, these studies have not dealt thoroughly with issues of selection bias. We use propensity scoring techniques to approximate the causal effects of food insecurity on children's health and health care use outcomes., METHODS: We use nationally representative data from the 2013-2016 waves of the National Health Interview Study (N = 29 341). Using inverse probability of treatment weighting, a propensity scoring method, we examine a broad range of child health outcomes and account for a comprehensive set of controls, focusing on a sample of children 2 to 17 years old., RESULTS: Household food insecurity was related to significantly worse general health, some acute and chronic health problems, and worse health care access, including forgone care and heightened emergency department use, for children. Compared to rates had they not been food insecure, children in food-insecure household had rates of lifetime asthma diagnosis and depressive symptoms that were 19.1% and 27.9% higher, rates of foregone medical care that were 179.8% higher, and rates of emergency department use that were 25.9% higher. No significant differences emerged for most communicable diseases, such as ear infections or chicken pox, or conditions that may develop more gradually, including anemia and diabetes., CONCLUSIONS: Policies used to reduce household food insecurity among children may also reduce children's chronic and acute health problems and health care needs.

N2  - Homelessness is a national epidemic and individuals experiencing homelessness have decreased access to healthcare services. At the same time, physical therapy (PT) educational programs are required to teach students about cultural competence, pro-bono service, and advocacy for underserved populations. Having PT students provide pro-bono services to this population in a supervised environment is a mutually beneficial scenario for the patients, students, and the PT program., AIMS: The study objective was to evaluate whether participating in a student-run free clinic (SRFC) at a homeless shelter could change PT students' attitudes towards individuals experiencing homelessness., METHODS: Forty DPT students completed the Health Professionals' Attitude Toward the Homeless Inventory (HPATHI) with 19 volunteering (experimental group) to participate in the SRFC. The HPATHI was administered again immediately following participation in the SRFC to assess if their attitudes had changed., RESULTS: Baseline scores differed between the control and experimental group (p=0.03). However, post-scores of the experimental group did not differ compared to pre-scores. The subsequent analysis estimated differences on 4 of 19 questions, specifically within the personal advocacy and social advocacy subscales., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, PT students' attitudes did not change significantly after one session of volunteering at an SRFC in a homeless shelter. However, small changes were seen in personal and social advocacy subscales of the HPATHI.

N2  - People who are homeless use more hospital-based care than average, yet little is known about how hospital and shelter use are interrelated. We examined the timing of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations relative to entry into and exit from New York City homeless shelters, using an analysis of linked health care and shelter administrative databases. In the year before shelter entry and the year following shelter exit, 39.3 percent and 43.3 percent, respectively, of first-time adult shelter users had an ED visit or hospitalization. Hospital visits-particularly ED visits-began to increase several months before shelter entry and declined over several months after shelter exit, with spikes in ED visits and hospitalizations in the days immediately before shelter entry and following shelter exit. We recommend cross-system collaborations to better understand and address the co-occurring health and housing needs of vulnerable populations.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In the U.S., non-binary refers to transgender people who have a gender identity not aligned with their assigned sex at birth, and who identify outside of the traditional male-female binary, such as genderqueer, genderfluid, or gender nonconforming. Few data are available to characterize the health of non-binary adults., METHODS: The current study sought to fill this gap by conducting a secondary analysis of data from a non-probability sample of transgender and/or gender nonconforming adults in Massachusetts (sample mean age 32.6 years, 63% female assigned sex at birth; 79.4% white non-Hispanic/Latinx). Multivariable models were fit to compare non-binary (e.g., genderqueer) vs. binary (e.g., man/trans man, woman/trans woman) respondents across a range of social and health indicators., RESULTS: Overall, 40.9% identified their gender identity as non-binary. Non-binary respondents significantly differed from binary respondents on (all p<0.05): demographics (younger age, more female assigned sex at birth); gender affirmation (older age of identity recognition, lower current uptake of and future desires for medical gender affirmation); healthcare utilization (lower rates of being up-to-date in annual wellness visit, less mental healthcare utilization in past year); mental health and substance use (higher past-week depressive distress, higher hazardous alcohol use); social history (more unstably housed, more current students), violence victimization (lower rates of lifetime intimate partner violence), and social support (less family support)., CONCLUSION: Gender diversity, including whether people endorse a binary or non-binary gender identity, is a prevalent and an important aspect of transgender health. Demographic measures of gender identity that include binary and non-binary response options are recommended to inform future research and clinical care.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Identifying distinct patterns of tobacco product use can inform efforts to reduce poly-tobacco use among young people, but little is known regarding patterns of use among youth experiencing homelessness. This study identified patterns of using tobacco/nicotine products among youth experiencing homelessness, and assessed whether certain subgroups of youth were more likely than others to engage in specific patterns of use., METHODS: Data were collected from a probability sample of 469 homeless youth who used tobacco in the past month, recruited from 25 service and street sites in Los Angeles County. Participants reported on lifetime and past month use of natural cigarettes, cigars, little cigars/cigarillos, electronic nicotine delivery systems, hookah, and chewing tobacco. Latent class analysis was used to identify patterns of tobacco product use., RESULTS: We identified four main classes of use: traditional cigarettes smokers (34.7% of the sample), poly-tobacco experimenters (24.9%), current users of combustible products (natural cigarettes, cigars, little cigars/cigarillos; 27.1%), and current poly-tobacco users (13.1%). Youth who were male, slept outdoors, and screened positive for substance abuse disorder were more than twice as likely as their counterparts to be current poly-tobacco users relative to traditional cigarettes smokers., CONCLUSIONS: Rates of poly-tobacco experimentation and current use among youth experiencing homelessness are high. This suggests that efforts to reduce the use of tobacco products in this population should focus on the combined use of these products, and further, that users with the greatest poly-use may have competing unmet needs such as substance use disorders and more severe homelessness.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The paper presents two-year findings from a study investigating the effectiveness of Housing First (HF) with assertive community treatment (ACT) in helping individuals with serious mental illness, who are homeless or precariously housed and living in a small city, to become stably housed., METHODS: The research design was a parallel group non-blinded RCT with participants randomly assigned after the baseline interview to receive HF with ACT (N = 100) or treatment as usual (TAU; N = 101). Participants were interviewed every 3 months over 21/24 months to investigate changes on a range of housing and psychosocial outcomes. The primary outcomes were housing stability (as defined by a joint function of number of days housed and number of moves) and improvement in community functioning. Secondary predicted outcomes were improvements in self-rated physical and mental health status, substance use problems, quality of life, community integration, and recovery., RESULTS: An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted. Compared to TAU participants, HF participants who entered housing did so more quickly (23.30 versus 88.25 days, d = 1.02, 95% CI [0.50-1.53], p < 0.001), spent a greater proportion of time stably housed (Z = 5.30, p < 0.001, OR = 3.12, 95% CI [1.96-4.27]), and rated the quality of their housing more positively (Z = 4.59, p < 0.001, d = 0.43, 95% CI [0.25-0.62]). HF participants were also more likely to be housed continually in the final 6 months (i.e., 79.57% vs. 55.47%), chi2 (2, n = 170) = 11.46, p = .003, Cramer's V = 0.26, 95% CI [0.14-0.42]). HF participants showed greater gains in quality of life, (Z = 3.83, p < 0.001, ASMD = 0.50, 95% CI [0.24-0.75]), psychological integration (Z = 12.89, p < 0.001, pooled ASMD = 0.91, 95% CI [0.77-1.05]), and perceived recovery (Z = 2.26, p = 0.03, ASMD = 0.39, 95% CI [0.05-0.74]) than TAU participants., CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that HF ends homelessness significantly more rapidly than TAU for a majority of individuals with serious mental illness who have a history of homelessness and live in a small city. In addition, compared to TAU, HF produces psychosocial benefits for its recipients that include an enhanced quality of life, a greater sense of belonging in the community, and greater improvements in perceived recovery from mental illness., TRIAL REGISTRATION: International Standard Randomized Control Trial Number Register Identifier: ISRCTN42520374 , assigned August 18, 2009.

N2  - The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program was reauthorized February 8, 2018, and invests $2 billion over 5 years to improve mothers' and children's outcomes across the life course. Along with this investment, the home-visiting field is striving for implementation innovations to deliver the greatest impact to the most families at the most efficient cost through a focus on precision home visiting. Consistent with the precision home-visiting approach to identify meaningful subgroups to guide content tailoring, the purpose of this paper is to answer (1) how and to what degree an evidence-based home-visiting model benefits mothers and children with substance use or depression and (2) what baseline characteristics indicate who can benefit most. We completed a secondary data analysis of the most recently completed randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Family Spirit (N = 322), a federally endorsed home-visiting intervention designed for young Native American mothers and their children. We examined how baseline differences in mothers' substance use, depression, and demographic characteristics (household mobility, education, parity, and premature birth) moderated mothers' and children's intervention-related outcomes. Children born to mothers with past substance use histories benefited more from the intervention than children born to abstinent mothers (p < 0.01). Unstable housing, parity, and low educational attainment emerged as moderators of intervention effectiveness. Results from this investigation will serve as a basis for designing and evaluating a precision approach to Family Spirit and may provide lessons for other models to explore tailoring variables for optimal impact and efficiency.

N2  - Youth experiencing homelessness have been shown to experience high levels of both trauma and substance use. However, prior work has yet to consider how substance use, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and homelessness are temporally, or reciprocally, associated over time. The current study uses symptom-driven and experience-driven models to examine the reciprocal relationships between substance use, PTSD symptoms, and homelessness among a large sample of adolescents receiving substance use treatment in the United States. Adolescents (n = 20,069; Mage = 15.6; 74% male) completed baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-month assessments. Autoregressive latent trajectory with structured residual (ALT-SR) models were used to examine within- and between-person relationships. We found continued support for prior work at the between-person level of analysis. At the within-person level, during the treatment phase, PTSD emerged as a key mechanism predicting both return to use and increased days of homelessness posttreatment. Further, greater substance use at treatment completion was associated with greater PTSD symptoms and homelessness, prospectively. The current study extends the previous work to consider individual level processes in conjunction with overarching event level predictors of homelessness. We found that PTSD symptomology is a driving factor that influences, both directly and indirectly, experiences of homelessness posttreatment. Interventions may wish to incorporate trauma informed approaches for youth entering treatment as this may mitigate long-term experiences of homelessness and return to substance use.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Economic vulnerability, such as homelessness and unemployment, contributes to the HIV risk among racial minorities in the U.S., who are disproportionately infected. Yet, few economic-strengthening interventions have been adapted for HIV prevention in economically-vulnerable African-American young adults. Engaging Microenterprise for Resource Generation and Health Empowerment (EMERGE) is a feasibility randomized clinical trial of an HIV prevention microenterprise intervention with integrated text messages ("nudges") that are informed by behavioral economic principles. The trial aims to reduce sexual risk behaviors and increase employment and uptake of HIV preventive behaviors., METHODS/DESIGN: In total, 40 young adults who are African-American, aged 18-24, live in Baltimore City, have experienced at least one episode of homelessness in the last 12 months, are unemployed or underemployed (fewer than 10 h per week), are not enrolled in school, own a cell phone with text messaging, and report at least one episode of unprotected or unsafe sex in the prior 12 months will be recruited from two community-based organizations providing residential supportive services to urban youth. Participants will undergo a 3-week run-in period and thereafter be randomly assigned to one of two groups with active interventions for 20 weeks. The first group ("comparison") will receive text messages with information on job openings. The second group ("experimental") will receive text messages with information on job openings plus information on HIV prevention and business educational sessions, a mentored apprenticeship, and a start-up grant, and business and HIV prevention text messages based on principles from behavioral economics. The two primary outcomes relate to the feasibility of conducting a larger trial. Secondary outcomes relate to employment, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV preventive practices. All participants will be assessed using an in-person questionnaire at pre-intervention (prior to randomization) and at 3 weeks post-intervention. To obtain repeated, longitudinal measures, participants will be assessed weekly using text message surveys from pre-intervention up to 3 weeks post-intervention., DISCUSSION: This study will be one of the first U.S.-based feasibility randomized clinical trials of an HIV prevention microenterprise intervention for economically-vulnerable African-American young adults. The findings will inform whether and how to conduct a larger efficacy trial for HIV risk reduction in this population., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03766165 .

N2  - BACKGROUND: Youth homelessness is a substantial issue, and many youths experiencing homelessness have mental health issues as both a cause and consequence of homelessness. These youths face many barriers to receiving traditional mental health services, and as a result, only a few youths experiencing homelessness receive any form of mental health care., OBJECTIVE: This project aimed to develop and determine the feasibility and acceptability of engaging young adults (ie, individuals aged 18-24 years) experiencing homelessness in a remotely delivered mental health intervention. This intervention provided brief emotional support and coping skills, drawing from cognitive behavioral principles as an introduction into psychosocial support. The intervention was piloted in a homeless shelter network., METHODS: A total of 35 young adults experiencing homelessness participated in a single-arm feasibility pilot trial. Participants received a mobile phone, a service and data plan, and 1 month of support from a coach consisting of up to 3 brief phone sessions, text messaging, and mobile mental health apps. We evaluated feasibility by looking at completion of sessions as well as the overall program and acceptability with satisfaction ratings. We also collected clinical symptoms at baseline and the end of the 1-month support period. We used validity items to identify participants who might be responding inappropriately and thus only report satisfaction ratings and clinical outcomes from valid responses., RESULTS: Most participants (20/35, 57%) completed all 3 of their phone sessions, with an average of 2.09 sessions (SD 1.22) completed by each participant. Participants sent an average of 15.06 text messages (SD 12.62) and received an average of 19.34 messages (SD 12.70). We found higher rates of satisfaction among the participants with valid responses, with 100% (23/23) of such participants indicating that they would recommend participation to someone else and 52% (12/23) reporting that they were very or extremely satisfied with their participation. We found very little change from pre- to posttreatment on measures of depression (d=0.27), post-traumatic stress disorder (d=0.17), and emotion regulation (d=0.10)., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that it was feasible to engage homeless young adults in mental health services in this technology-based intervention with high rates of satisfaction. We did not find changes in clinical outcomes; however, we had a small sample size and a brief intervention. Technology might be an important avenue to reach young adults experiencing homelessness, but additional work could explore proper interventions to deliver with such a platform., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03620682; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03620682.

T1  - The Effect of the Earned Income Tax Credit on Housing and Living Arrangements.
A1  - Pilkauskas, Natasha

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - As rents have risen and wages have not kept pace, housing affordability in the United States has declined over the last 15 years, impacting the housing and living arrangements of low-income families. Housing subsidies improve the housing situations of low-income families, but less than one in four eligible families receive a voucher. In this article, we analyze whether one of the largest anti-poverty programs in the United States-the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)-affects the housing (eviction, homelessness, and affordability) and living arrangements (doubling up, number of people in the household, and crowding) of low-income families. Using the Current Population Survey, the American Community Survey/decennial census, and the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, we employ a parameterized difference-in-differences strategy to examine whether policy-induced expansions to the EITC affect the housing and living arrangements of single mothers. Results suggest that a $1,000 increase in the EITC improves housing by reducing housing cost burdens, but it has no effect on eviction or homelessness. Increases in the EITC also reduce doubling up (living with additional, nonnuclear family adults)-in particular, doubling up in someone else's home-and reduce three-generation/multigenerational coresidence, suggesting that mothers have a preference to live independently. We find weak evidence for a reduction in overall household size, yet the EITC does reduce household crowding. Although the EITC is not an explicit housing policy, expansions to the EITC are generally linked with improved housing outcomes for single mothers and their children.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There is limited experimental evidence on transitional care interventions beyond 30 days post-discharge and in vulnerable populations., OBJECTIVE: Evaluate effects of a transitional care practice (TC) that comprehensively addresses patients' medical and psychosocial needs following hospital discharge., DESIGN: Pragmatic, randomized comparative effectiveness trial., PATIENTS: Adults discharged from an initial emergency, observation, or inpatient hospital encounter with no trusted usual source of care., INTERVENTIONS: TC intervention included a scheduled post-discharge appointment at the TC practice, where a multidisciplinary team comprehensively assessed patients' medical and psychosocial needs, addressed modifiable barriers, and subsequent linkage to a new primary care source. Routine Care involved assistance scheduling a post-discharge appointment with a primary care provider that often partnered with the hospital where the initial encounter occurred., MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was a binary indicator of death or additional hospital encounters within 90 days of initial discharge. Secondary outcomes included any additional hospital encounters, and counts of hospital encounters, over 180 days., KEY RESULTS: Four hundred ninety patients were randomized to TC intervention and 164 to Routine Care; 34.6% were uninsured, 49.7% had Medicaid, and 57.4% were homeless or lived in a high-poverty area. There was no significant difference between arms in the 90-day probability of death or additional hospital encounters (relative risk [RR] 0.89; 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-1.13). However, TC patients had 37% and 35% lower probability of any inpatient admission over 90 days (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.43-0.91) and 180 days (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.47-0.89), respectively. Over 180 days, TC patients had 42% fewer inpatient admissions (incidence rate ratio 0.58; 95% CI 0.37-0.90)., CONCLUSIONS: Among patients randomized to a patient-centered transitional care intervention, there was no significant reduction in 90-day probability of death or additional hospital encounters. However, there were significant decreases in measures of inpatient admissions over 180 days., TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03066492.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With 47 600 opioid-related deaths in 2017, the yearly deaths have surpassed the HIV/AIDS peak yearly death rates. Residential rehabilitation (RR) and medication-assisted treatments (MAT) are commonly utilized treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD)., METHODS: All patients (n = 182) who were admitted to the Boston Veterans Health Administration for inpatient admission for medically supervised opioid withdrawal in 2015 were included. Deceased patients were matched 1:1, based on age and sex to living patients from the 182-patient cohort. Nationwide electronic medical records were analyzed from 2015 through 2018. Via multilinear regression, risk factor correlation to all-cause mortality (the dependent variable) was our main outcome. Primary risk factors included recurrent admissions for medically supervised withdrawals and exposure to RR or MAT. Secondary risk factors were opioid use traits, nonopioid drug use, partner support, education level, homelessness, and employment., RESULTS: 18.4% (n = 34) were deceased by the time of follow-up-equivalent to 4760 deaths per 100 000 person-years. A total of 61.8% (n = 21) of these deaths were directly related to opioid use. Completion of RR correlated with lower predicted mortality (beta = -8.21, P = 0.03). In contrast, attending RR but not completing correlated with higher predicted mortality rate (beta = 6.51, P = 0.046). Concurrent benzodiazepine use (beta = 8.99, P = 0.047), generalized anxiety disorder (beta = 7.13, P = 0.03) and major depressive disorder (beta = 5.44, P = 0.04) increased risk of death., CONCLUSION AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: OUD carries a shockingly high lethality in Veterans requiring inpatient admission for opioid withdrawal, particularly when there are untreated comorbid psychiatric conditions. RR and MAT are correlated to lower all-cause mortality in this population and should be highly utilized. Given the extremely high mortality, intensive system-wide interventions are needed for the care of Veterans with OUD. On the basis of the reduced predicted mortality with RR and MAT, further research into novel MATs as well as refining RR programs should be a major focus. (Am J Addict 2019;28:318-323).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Head and neck tuberculosis (HNTB) especially cervical lymphadenopathy are the most common extrapulmonary indications of TB, but remain a diagnostic challenge. In this study, we describe and analyze the epidemiologic characteristics of HNTB on a population-level., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 547 HNTB cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's TB Genotyping Information Management System in Texas from 2009 to 2016 and compare and contrast differences between diagnosed exclusively HNTB and HNTB with concurrent pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB)., RESULTS: The majority of patients with HNTB were diagnosed with cervical lymphadenopathy (96.9%), age 25-44 (47.3%) and female (52.7%). Co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus, being homeless, excessive alcohol use within the past 12 months and drug use were more frequently seen for HNTB with concurrent pulmonary involvement compared to reported patients with exclusively HNTB. The highest prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineage in exclusively HNTB was Euro-American L4 (52.3%), followed by Indo-Oceanic L1 (21.5%) and East-Asian L2 (13.1%). One multidrug resistant TB case was identified. Seven deaths were reported during treatment., CONCLUSION: Our findings provide a better understanding of the epidemiology of HNTB and characteristics associated with the disease at the population-level, which is important in managing HNTB patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: School-delivered nutrition assistance programs have improved dietary intake for children from food-insecure households during the school year. However, little is known about their diet quality and eating patterns during summer months., OBJECTIVE: School-aged children's summer month weekday and weekend day diet quality and eating patterns were assessed by household food insecurity., DESIGN: Secondary analysis of cross-sectional data was employed., PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: During the summers of 2011 through 2017, baseline data were collected from parent-child dyads participating in one of two community-based obesity prevention trials in metropolitan Minnesota (N=218). The mean age of children was 10 years; 50% were girls, 49% were nonwhite, and 25% were from food-insecure households., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Children from food-secure and food-insecure households were identified by using the short form of the US Household Food Security Survey. Healthy Eating Index 2015 and eating patterns-including energy intake and consumption of whole fruits, vegetables, 100% fruit/vegetable juice, and sugar-sweetened beverages-were estimated by means of 24-hour dietary recall interviews conducted on weekdays and weekend days., STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: General linear modeling was used to examine diet quality and eating patterns by food insecurity, controlling for child age, child body mass index z score, and parent education., RESULTS: Children from food-insecure and food-secure households had Healthy Eating Index 2015 scores less than 50. Children from food-insecure households reported less energy intake, fewer cups of whole fruit, and more sugar-sweetened beverage consumption for every 1,000 kcal consumed on a weekend day when compared with their counterparts from food-secure households (P<0.05). Similar results were not seen for weekday eating patterns., CONCLUSIONS: Whole fruit and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption varied by food insecurity on weekend days during summer months. Because children tend to gain weight during summer months, efforts to increase weekend access to whole fruits and promote water consumption may contribute to weight gain prevention and healthy development, especially for children from food-insecure households.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In the UK, hepatitis B virus (HBV) incidence is associated with migrants from particular high-burden countries and population groups deemed 'hard-to-reach' by standard healthcare services: the homeless, people who inject drugs and ex-prisoners. Currently, there is a national targeted HBV vaccine policy for such at-risk groups, but there is limited recent evidence about 1) the levels of vaccine uptake, 2) the factors associated with incomplete vaccination, and 3) reasons for incomplete vaccination., METHODS: A questionnaire capturing social and medical history, demographic factors and information about HBV vaccination status was completed by individuals deemed hard-to-reach due to socio-structural factors that criminalise, isolate and stigmatise who consented to participate in a randomised controlled trial of a peer intervention to promote engagement with hepatitis C services. The questionnaire also captured the reasons for incomplete vaccination. Descriptive, univariable and multivariable regression analyses were undertaken., RESULTS: Three hundred fourty six participants completed the questionnaire. 1) 52.3% (n = 181) reported full HBV vaccination. 2) Within a multivariable model adjusting for sociodemographic variables, the presence of one or two or more socio-structural factors that are included in the national targeted vaccination policy was associated with protection against incomplete HBV vaccination (51.7% vaccine coverage in those with one factor, odds ratio 0.43 [95% confidence interval 0.20-0.92]); 70.1% coverage with two or more factors, 0.19 [0.09-0.39]; overall p-value < 0.001). Being female was also associated with lower vaccine uptake (2.37 [1.24-4.57], 0.01). Examining the socio-structural factors individually, intravenous drug use was associated with protection against incomplete HBV vaccination. 3) The most common reasons declared for incomplete vaccination were never being offered the vaccine or not returning for further doses., CONCLUSION: Within this study of HBV vaccination uptake among hard-to-reach population groups in London, UK, we document 52.3% coverage of the full vaccine course. Critically, although participants recommended for immunisation within national guidelines had an increased likelihood of receiving a complete vaccine course, we note surprisingly low coverage in the presence of the risk factors that are national indicators for vaccination. Public health bodies should make additional efforts to improve coverage in the hard-to-reach through improved vaccine delivery systems., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN24707359 , Registered 19th October 2012.

N2  - BACKGROUND: NEETs (young people not in employment, education or training) are at higher risk for poorer mental and physical health. In France, the Missions locales (MLs) are the only social structures dedicated to this population. We sought to determine whether the systematic offer of a social and preventive medicine consultation at a ML might increase NEET participants' access to training in the 12 months following the intervention., METHODS: This intervention research was a parallel randomised controlled interventional study conducted at five MLs in mainland France in 2011-2012. It included 976 NEETs aged 18 to 25 years who attended one of the five MLs. At inclusion, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to three groups: those in the first group were invited to see a social worker (not studied in this paper), those in the second group were invited to see a doctor and a social worker (intervention group), and the third was a control group. The primary outcome was participation in at least one training session during the year following study inclusion., RESULTS: Among the 976 participants, 504 were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 472 to the control group; 704 (72.1%) were included in the analyses. A significantly higher proportion of the participants in the intervention group participated in a training session in the 12 months following the intervention than of those in the control group (63.3% vs 55.6%; p = 0.04). This difference was significantly greater for women, those less than 21 years of age, those unstably housed and those with a lower level of education., CONCLUSIONS: Social and preventive medicine consultations that are fully integrated into the social services for NEETs have an impact on their access to training and contribute to changing some of their health-related behaviours. This may improve their access to the labour market.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To compare health-related quality of life and prevalence of chronic diseases in housed and homeless populations., DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey with an age-matched and sex-matched housed comparison group., SETTING: Hostels, day centres and soup runs in London and Birmingham, England., PARTICIPANTS: Homeless participants were either sleeping rough or living in hostels and had a history of sleeping rough. The comparison group was drawn from the Health Survey for England. The study included 1336 homeless and 13 360 housed participants., OUTCOME MEASURES: Chronic diseases were self-reported asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), epilepsy, heart problems, stroke and diabetes. Health-related quality of life was measured using EQ-5D-3L., RESULTS: Housed participants in more deprived neighbourhoods were more likely to report disease. Homeless participants were substantially more likely than housed participants in the most deprived quintile to report all diseases except diabetes (which had similar prevalence in homeless participants and the most deprived housed group). For example, the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was 1.1% (95% CI 0.7% to 1.6%) in the least deprived housed quintile; 2.0% (95% CI 1.5% to 2.6%) in the most deprived housed quintile; and 14.0% (95% CI 12.2% to 16.0%) in the homeless group. Social gradients were also seen for problems in each EQ-5D-3L domain in the housed population, but homeless participants had similar likelihood of reporting problems as the most deprived housed group. The exception was problems related to anxiety, which were substantially more common in homeless people than any of the housed groups., CONCLUSIONS: While differences in health between housed socioeconomic groups can be described as a 'slope', differences in health between housed and homeless people are better understood as a 'cliff'.

N2  - Social quality is the extent to which people are able to participate in social relationships under conditions which enhance their well-being, capacities and potential and enables them to shape their own circumstances and contribute to societal development. We assessed whether women in homeless shelters differed from men on social quality factors that constitute the quality of their daily life and whether factor scores changed at a different rate for women and men after shelter exit. Data were collected as part of a randomised controlled trial. In 18 shelters across the Netherlands, 183 participants were recruited between December 2010 and December 2012 and followed for 9 months. Adults were eligible if they were about to move from shelter to (supported) independent housing and their shelter stay had been shorter than 14 months. At baseline, women were significantly younger than men. They were more likely to have children, to have minor children staying with them, to be lower educated, to be unemployed and to have been victimised than men. Women had used more services and reported lower self-esteem, less satisfaction with health and empowerment and higher psychological distress. They were less likely than men to have used alcohol excessively or cannabis. We found no significant differences between women and men in changes over time on the social quality factors. As women were disadvantaged at baseline compared to men regarding many factors, we concluded that women in homeless shelters are a particularly vulnerable group. Moreover, an opportunity remains for shelter services to improve women's social quality during and after their shelter stay. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

N2  - PURPOSE: To compare clinical characteristics and outcomes between critically ill homeless and non-homeless patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in a Korea., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical charts of homeless and non-homeless patients admitted to ICU at Seoul Boramae Medical Center between January 2012 and December 2017. Patients were selected using 1: 2 propensity score matching including age, sex, and type of ICU and multivariate analyses were performed to determine risk factors for hospital and ICU mortality., RESULTS: 56 homeless and 112 non-homeless matched patients were analyzed. The homeless patients were younger, included more men, and exhibited significantly higher readmission and ER admission rates. Although hospital and ICU mortality rates were similar between two groups, the homeless patients were significantly less likely to have family or substitute decision-makers and generally died after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Adjusted multivariate analysis showed that homelessness was not an independent predictor of ICU or hospital mortality. The length of ICU stay was comparable between groups., CONCLUSIONS: In Korea, ICU-admitted homeless patients are well managed without differences in terms of organ support quality and exhibit the same prognosis as non-homeless patients. However, the quality of end-of-life care for homeless patients remains poor. Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare clinician perspectives for the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) with those of adolescent patients and parents., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., SETTING: Urban academic pediatric and adolescent medicine practices and school-based health clinics in a large urban community with a high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections and a national sample of adolescent-serving clinicians., PARTICIPANTS: Female patients aged 12-19 years, parents raising an adolescent older than the age of 12 years in the urban community, and clinicians who serve adolescents recruited from regional and national listservs., INTERVENTIONS: None., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual analogue scale scores on a scale of 0-10 corresponding to preferences on patient disposition in 17 clinical scenarios for a hypothetical patient with PID., RESULTS: Compared with adolescents, clinicians were significantly more likely to endorse hospitalizations when patients presented with severe or complicated illness (beta = 0.9; standard error [SE], 0.22; P < .001), possible surgical emergency (beta = 0.83; SE, 0.2; P < .001), concurrent pregnancy (beta = 0.59; SE, 0.3; P = .046), or failure of outpatient treatment (beta = 0.58; SE, 0.29; P = .045). Compared with clinicians, adolescents were significantly more likely to endorse hospitalizations when patients presented at a young age (beta = 1.36; SE, 0.38; P < .001), were homeless (beta = 0.88; SE, 0.32; P = .007), were afraid to inform a partner (beta = 1.66; SE, 0.40; P < .001), or had unaware parents (beta = 2.86; SE, 0.39; P < .001)., CONCLUSION: Clinicians were more likely to recommend hospitalization when doing so adhered to national guidelines on PID treatment. Adolescents opted for hospitalization more often than clinicians in scenarios in which patients exhibited social vulnerability. Clinicians should engage with adolescents in shared disposition planning and use a more nuanced approach to PID management for adolescents who might not be able to tolerate an outpatient regimen.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Indigenous people in Canada are not only over-represented among the homeless population but their pathways to homelessness may differ from those of non-Indigenous people. This study investigated the history and current status of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people experiencing homelessness and mental illness. We hypothesised that compared with non-Indigenous people, those who are Indigenous would demonstrate histories of displacement earlier in life, higher rates of trauma and self-medication with alcohol and other substances., DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective data were collected from a sample recruited through referral from diverse social and health agencies in Winnipeg and Vancouver., PARTICIPANTS: Eligibility included being 19 years or older, current mental disorder and homelessness., MEASURES: Data were collected via interviews, using questionnaires, on sociodemographics (eg, age, ethnicity, education), mental illness, substance use, physical health, service use and quality of life. Univariate and multivariable models were used to model the association between Indigenous ethnicity and dependent variables., RESULTS: A total of 1010 people met the inclusion criteria, of whom 439 self-identified as Indigenous. In adjusted models, Indigenous ethnicity was independently associated with being homeless at a younger age, having a lifetime duration of homelessness longer than 3 years, post-traumatic stress disorder, less severe mental disorder, alcohol dependence, more severe substance use in the past month and infectious disease. Indigenous participants were also nearly twice as likely as others (47% vs 25%) to have children younger than 18 years., CONCLUSIONS: Among Canadians who are homeless and mentally ill, those who are Indigenous have distinct histories and current needs that are consistent with the legacy of colonisation. Responses to Indigenous homelessness must be developed within the context of reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians, addressing trauma, substance use and family separations., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN42520374, ISRCTN57595077, ISRCTN66721740.

N2  - BACKGROUND: People who use drugs (PWUD) commonly experience housing vulnerability due to the intersection of drug laws, housing policies, gentrification, and social marginalization. Housing vulnerability produces social suffering amongst PWUD and is linked to health and social harms. In Vancouver, Canada, the rapid gentrification of the Downtown Eastside - a low-income inner-city neighbourhood - and the lack of affordable housing has led to residential evictions emerging as a key community concern. This study sought to understand the policies and practices that produced evictions among PWUD, situating vulnerabilities to evictions within the context of wider structural vulnerability of PWUD., METHODS: Between June 2015 and March 2016, baseline and 3-6 month follow-up qualitative interviews were conducted with recently evicted (past 60 days) PWUD in the Downtown Eastside. Participants were recruited by Peer Research Assistants. Baseline interviews (n = 56) focused on causes and socio-legal contexts of evictions, with follow-up interviews (n=41) focusing on longer-term impacts. Interviews were analyzed thematically and interpreted by drawing on the concept of structural vulnerability., RESULTS: Most participants were evicted unlawfully, unfairly, and into homelessness. Participants were rendered structurally vulnerable to unlawful evictions by the shortcomings of existing residential tenancy laws and current dispute mechanisms. Residents of non-profit buildings, for whom it was unclear if provincial residential protections apply, found their housing security further undermined through the denial of rights extended to privately-housed tenants. Attempts to assert tenant rights further increased participants' vulnerability to eviction through landlord retaliation and targeting., CONCLUSION: Findings demonstrate the inadequacy of existing housing policies and tenancy supports to account for the structural vulnerability of PWUD and their role in driving harms. Policy reforms are needed to address unlawful evictions and increase tenancy security, and must be accompanied by low-barrier interventions to more fully address this key driver of social suffering among PWUD.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Little is known about long-term viral suppression rates for patients who start antiretroviral therapy (ART) soon after diagnosis. We describe virologic outcomes from the San Francisco-based Ward 86 Rapid ART Program for Individuals with an HIV Diagnosis (RAPID) ART program., DESIGN: Retrospective review of clinic-based cohort., METHODS: In 2013, Ward 86 adopted immediate ART at the first visit after HIV diagnosis. Patients were referred from testing sites, offered same or next-day intakes, and received multidisciplinary evaluation, support, and insurance enrollment/optimization. Patients were provided ART starter packs and close follow-up. Demographics and labs were extracted from medical records. Subsequent viral loads were obtained from public health surveillance data. Kaplan-Meier curves summarized distribution of times to first viral suppression; viral suppression rates at last viral load recorded were calculated., RESULTS: Of 225 patients referred to RAPID ART from 2013 to 2017, 216 (96%) were started on immediate-ART: median age 30; 7.9% women; 11.6% African-American, 26.9% Hispanic, 36.6% white; 51.4% with substance use; 48.1% with mental health diagnoses; 30.6% unstably housed; baseline median CD4 cell count 441 cells/mul median viral load 37 011. By 1 year after intake, 95.8% achieved viral suppression to less than 200 cells/mul at least once. Over a median follow-up time of 1.09 years (0-3.92), 14.7% of patients had viral rebound, but most (78%) resuppressed. Viral suppression rates were 92.1% at last recorded viral load., CONCLUSION: In an urban clinic with high rates of mental illness, substance use and housing instability, immediate ART provided through a RAPID program resulted in viral suppression at last viral load measurement for more than 90% of patients over a median of 1.09 years. RAPID ART for vulnerable populations is acceptable, feasible, and successful with multidisciplinary care and municipal support.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate treatment outcomes and associated characteristics of persons experiencing homelessness who received 12-weekly doses of directly observed isoniazid and rifapentine (3HP/DOT) treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI)., METHODS: Among homeless persons treated with 3HP/DOT during July 2011 -June 2015 in 11 U.S. TB programs, we conducted descriptive analyses of observational data, and identified associations between sociodemographic factors and treatment outcomes. Qualitative interviews were conducted to understand programmatic experiences., RESULTS: Of 393 persons experiencing homelessness (median age: 50 years; range: 13-74 years), 301 (76.6%) completed treatment, 55 (14.0%) were lost to follow-up, 18 (4.6%) stopped because of an adverse event (AE), and 19 (4.8%) stopped after relocations or refusing treatment. Eighty-one (20.6%) had at least one AE. Persons aged >=65 were more likely to discontinue treatment than persons aged 31-44 years. Programs reported difficulty in following up with persons experiencing homelessness because of relocations, mistrust, and alcohol or drug use., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of administering the 3HP/DOT LTBI regimen to persons experiencing homelessness, a high-risk population.

N2  - Children learn to like a wide variety of healthy foods through exposure in their early feeding environment. While some children may reject foods during this learning process, parents may perceive persistent refusal as 'fussy' or 'picky' eating. Low-income parents may provide fussy children with a narrow range of foods that they will like and accept to avoid food and economic waste; inadvertently limiting children's exposure to a variety of healthy foods. This 'risk aversion' to food rejection may be particularly salient in food insecure households where resources are further constrained. We aimed to examine if food insecurity modifies the relationship between child fussy eating and parents' food provision and feeding with respect to exposure to a variety of healthy foods. Australian mothers residing in a low-income community (N=260) completed a cross-sectional survey on their preschool-aged child's 'food fussiness', household food insecurity and food exposure practices. Food exposure practices included the home availability of fruit and vegetables, and children's tasting of a variety of fruit and vegetables (food provision); and whether parents prepared alternative meals for their child (feeding). Mothers reporting food insecurity (11%) were less likely to have fruit frequently available in the home compared to mothers reporting food security. Food insecurity moderated the relationship between fussy eating and food exposure practices insofar that food secure mothers were more likely to prepare alternative meals for fussier children. Family resources and child fussy eating behaviours are identified as important contextual factors in food provision and feeding. Findings from the current study suggest that health professionals, researchers and policymakers tailor interventions to consider both the needs of families and child eating characteristics.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Directly observed treatment (DOT) has been the standard of care for tuberculosis since the early 1990s, but it is inconvenient for patients and service providers. Video-observed therapy (VOT) has been conditionally recommended by WHO as an alternative to DOT. We tested whether levels of treatment observation were improved with VOT., METHODS: We did a multicentre, analyst-blinded, randomised controlled superiority trial in 22 clinics in England (UK). Eligible participants were patients aged at least 16 years with active pulmonary or non-pulmonary tuberculosis who were eligible for DOT according to local guidance. Exclusion criteria included patients who did not have access to charging a smartphone. We randomly assigned participants to either VOT (daily remote observation using a smartphone app) or DOT (observations done three to five times per week in the home, community, or clinic settings). Randomisation was done by the SealedEnvelope service using minimisation. DOT involved treatment observation by a health-care or lay worker, with any remaining daily doses self-administered. VOT was provided by a centralised service in London. Patients were trained to record and send videos of every dose ingested 7 days per week using a smartphone app. Trained treatment observers viewed these videos through a password-protected website. Patients were also encouraged to report adverse drug events on the videos. Smartphones and data plans were provided free of charge by study investigators. DOT or VOT observation records were completed by observers until treatment or study end. The primary outcome was completion of 80% or more scheduled treatment observations over the first 2 months following enrolment. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and restricted (including only patients completing at least 1 week of observation on allocated arm) analyses were done. Superiority was determined by a 15% difference in the proportion of patients with the primary outcome (60% vs 75%). This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number registry, number ISRCTN26184967., FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2014, and Oct 1, 2016, we randomly assigned 226 patients; 112 to VOT and 114 to DOT. Overall, 131 (58%) patients had a history of homelessness, imprisonment, drug use, alcohol problems or mental health problems. In the ITT analysis, 78 (70%) of 112 patients on VOT achieved >=80% scheduled observations successfully completed during the first 2 months compared with 35 (31%) of 114 on DOT (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 5.48, 95% CI 3.10-9.68; p<0.0001). In the restricted analysis, 78 (77%) of 101 patients on VOT achieved the primary outcome compared with 35 (63%) of 56 on DOT (adjusted OR 2.52; 95% CI 1.17-5.54; p=0.017). Stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting were the most common adverse events reported (in 16 [14%] of 112 on VOT and nine [8%] of 114 on DOT)., INTERPRETATION: VOT was a more effective approach to observation of tuberculosis treatment than DOT. VOT is likely to be preferable to DOT for many patients across a broad range of settings, providing a more acceptable, effective, and cheaper option for supervision of daily and multiple daily doses than DOT., FUNDING: National Institute for Health Research.

N2  - In Canada, about 6,000 youth are homeless every night, many of whom suffer from addiction and psychotic disorders. To facilitate the exit out of homelessness, access to care and to improve psychosis and addiction outcomes, a new intensive outreach intervention team (EQIIP SOL) was created in Montreal (2012). It offers intensive outreach services dedicated to homeless youth suffering from first episode psychosis and addiction (HYFEPA) in addition to an early psychosis intervention service (EIS) in collaboration with the Addiction Psychiatry Unit. Our aim is to describe the characteristics, clinical, functional and housing outcomes of HYFEPA followed by EQIIP SOL. This two years long prospective longitudinal study with all HYFEPA (n=42) admitted to EQIIP SOL between 2012-2015 reports at multiple time points, clinical (CGI, GAF), functional (SOFAS, work/study, housing autonomy) and substance use disorder (DUS, AUS) outcomes and acute services use (hospitalizations, emergency room visits). We observed that, at baseline, HYFEPA showed poor prognostic factors (eg. cluster B personality, substance use disorders, legal problems, childhood trauma and lower education level). The majority reached housing stability after 6 months and their functioning and illness severity improved with time. This suggests that HYFEPA improve with an intensive outreach intervention team integrated to an EIS. Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Purpose To assess the radiologic findings associated with intimate partner violence (IPV). Materials and Methods Electronic medical records of 185 patients referred to the IPV support program from the emergency department (ED) between January 2015 and October 2016 were retrospectively reviewed and compared with an age- and sex-matched control group of 555 subjects (1:3 ratio of IPV victims to control subjects) who presented to the ED. Reports of all imaging studies performed within 5 years prior to the index ED visit were reviewed. Results The majority of patients who experienced IPV (mean age, 34.2 years +/- 12.2 [standard deviation]) were female (178 of 185 [96.2%]) and were largely African American (69 of 185 [37.3%]). Demographic and clinical variables independently associated with IPV were race (odds ratio [OR] range, 3.2-5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8, 12.7), psychiatric comorbidities (OR, 5.4; 95% CI: 3.4, 8.8), and homelessness (OR, 13.0; 95% CI: 5.4, 31.2). IPV victims underwent more imaging studies in the preceding 5 years (median, four studies) than did control subjects (median, one study). Obstetric-gynecologic findings (OR, 4.4; 95% CI: 2.1, 9.6) and acute fractures (OR, 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.3) seen on images were independently associated with IPV. The addition of imaging findings to demographic and clinical variables increased the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the multivariate model to detect IPV (0.87 vs 0.86, P < .01), and the cross-validated multivariate model had an AUC of 0.85. Acute fractures involved the face or skull (range, P < .01 to P = .05), and chronic fractures affected the extremities and nasal bone (P < .01 and P = .05, respectively) more frequently in the IPV group than in the control group. Conclusion Intimate partner violence victims undergo more imaging studies and have a higher frequency of potential violence-related imaging findings when compared with age- and sex-matched control subjects. © RSNA, 2019 See also the editorial by Flores and Narayan in this issue.

N2  - Human trafficking is a significant and growing public health concern. Subgroups of adolescents and young adults are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking, especially youth who are unstably housed or homeless. While youth experiencing trafficking come into contact with the healthcare system, they are often not identified during routine assessment due to lack of specific inquiry and low disclosure. Therefore, we utilized a mixed-methods study design to assess the differences in the identification of human trafficking among youth experiencing homelessness (n = 129) between a standard psychosocial assessment tool and a human trafficking specific assessment tool. Findings indicate that the tool developed to specifically assess for human trafficking was more likely to identify youth experiencing sexual and labor exploitation, as well as the risk factors for human trafficking. Secondly, youth reported that mistrust of the system, fear of involving the police if reported, not wanting to interact with the mental healthcare system, and stigma are barriers to disclosing human trafficking. In conclusion, healthcare providers caring for youth experiencing homelessness should adopt improved screening tools for human trafficking to reduce the risk of missed opportunities for prevention and treatment among this high-risk population of youth.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of an integrated care model on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of formerly chronically homeless individuals in permanent supportive housing., METHODS: From 2014 to 2017, eligible individuals in Houston, Texas (n = 323), were placed in 1 of 2 permanent supportive housing service delivery models. Both models included coordinated care teams. In the intervention group, teams had a single plan of care with the partnering clinic. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and 36-item Short Form Survey were administered at baseline and every 6 months for 30 months. We assessed intervention group emergency department use at 2 years. We evaluated change by using hierarchical linear growth models., RESULTS: There was a significant and clinically meaningful increase in HRQOL in the intervention group, with the intervention group reporting improvement over the comparison group. Intervention group emergency department use decreased by 70% (no comparison group)., CONCLUSIONS: Those in the intervention group with a single, coordinated plan of care reported significant and clinically meaningful increases in their HRQOL. Public Health Implications. Coordinated care models have potential to reduce societal costs and increase HRQOL, providing a financial and humanitarian justification for the continued investment in collaborative care in permanent supportive housing.

N2  - About 1.3 million homeless students attend schools across the US, yet little is known about their substance use patterns, especially substance use on school grounds. The objectives of this study were to examine differences in substance use on and off school grounds between nonsheltered homeless, sheltered homeless, and nonhomeless public school students, and to examine the relationship between homelessness and substance use in school. Data were from a statewide representative sample from the California Healthy Kids Survey collected in 2011-2013, (n=390,028). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were applied. Findings show that compared to nonhomeless students, homeless students, both sheltered and nonsheltered, reported higher rates of age at first time of use under the age of 10, and recent substance use, for an array of substances, indulging alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and other illegal drugs. Additionally about 50% of nonsheltered homeless students, and 15% of sheltered homeless students reported having used substances in school in the past 30days. Results from logistic regressions indicate that homelessness is associated with substance use in school. Particularly, nonsheltered homeless students were 17.41, 12.09, 11.36 and 17.59 times more likely to report smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, using marijuana and using other illegal drugs (respectively) in school in the past 30days, compared to nonhomeless students. Sheltered homeless students were also more likely to use substances in school compared to nonhomeless students, but less likely compared to nonsheltered students. Findings highlight the need to develop differentiated school-based responses to each homeless subgroup and have conceptual, scientific and policy implications. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background: Despite the popularity of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) among young people across North America and Europe, MDMA is rarely explored in studies of young people at high risk of injecting drugs. We conducted a study among street-involved youth who use illicit drugs in Vancouver, Canada, to understand if use of MDMA is associated with initiation of injection drugs. Methods: We followed injection-naive participants in the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), an ongoing prospective cohort of street-involved youth aged 14-26 who use illicit drugs. Bivariate and multivariate extended Cox models with time-updated variables were used to examine the association between MDMA use and initiation of injection drug use between September 2005 and May 2015. Results: Among 483 youth, 306 (63.4%) had a history of MDMA use and 218 (45.1%) had used MDMA in the previous 6 months at baseline. A total of 105 (21.7%) youth initiated injection drug use over the 10-year period, yielding an incidence density of 8.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.96-10.30) per 100 person-years. MDMA use was not significantly associated with initiating injection drugs at the bivariate (hazard ratio: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.61-1.42) or multivariate (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.57-1.35) level, after adjusting for socio-demographic and substance use confounders. Conclusions: Amid ongoing frequent use of MDMA among some young people in North America, we did not observe an elevated risk of injection initiation among those who used MDMA in this cohort of street-involved youth.

N2  - To achieve WHO hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination targets by 2030, mathematical models suggest there needs to be significant scale-up of treatment among people who inject drugs (PWID). We tested whether people who actively inject drugs can be recruited and treated successfully through a community needle and syringe programme (NSP), and assessed rates of re-infection. 105 HCV RNA positive participants were enrolled prospectively. Participants were recruited from the largest NSP in Dundee over 42 months. 94/105 individuals commenced treatment. Genotype 1 (G1) individuals (n = 37) were treated with peg-interferon+ribavirin+Simepravir/Telaprevir. Genotype 2/3 (G2/3) (n = 57) received peg-interferon+ribavirin. Weekly study visits took place within the NSP. Mean age of participants was 34.0 years (SD 6.9), 71.3% (61/94) were male. One in five (20/94) participants were homeless. 68.1% (64/94) were on OST (opiate substitution therapy) at enrolment; participants injected median 6.5 times/wk. In terms of clinical outcomes, >80% treatment adherence was 71.3% (67/94). There was no difference in SVR-12 rates by genotype: 81.0% (30/37) for G1 and 82.5% (47/55) for G2/3. At 18 months post-treatment, 15/77 participants were reinfected, followed up over 69.8 person-years, yielding a re-infection rate of 21.5/100 person-years (95% CI 13.00-35.65). This trial demonstrates that HCV treatment can be delivered successfully to the target population of treatment as prevention strategies. We report higher rates of re-infection than existing estimates among PWID. Scale-up of HCV treatment should be pursued alongside a comprehensive programme of harm reduction interventions to help minimize re-infection and reduce HCV transmission.

N2  - This article examines the feasibility of a complex intervention designed to facilitate the transition of youth out of homelessness. It is intended to contribute to efforts to build out the youth homelessness intervention literature, which is underdeveloped relative to descriptive characterizations of risk. The 6-month intervention examined here, referred to as the Housing Outreach Program-Collaboration (HOP-C), is comprised of transitional outreach-based case management, individual and group mental health supports, and peer support. The intervention was delivered through a multiagency, interdisciplinary collaboration. Feasibility was assessed using a mixed methods design that included prepost intervention metrics and the study site was a large Canadian urban center. A total of 31 youth participated in the study with 28 completing the intervention. Overall, implementation and youth engagement was successful though patterns and intensity of engagement were quite variable. While prepost, self-report metrics improved modestly, substantial gains were observed in employment, education, and mental health service connectedness. Qualitative themes focused on the benefits of a flexible, multicomponent approach, close attention to seamless delivery and common factors, and supporting youth in the balance of isolation versus independence. These findings suggested that this tertiary prevention approach is feasible and warrants further investigation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).

N2  - Drop-in centers offer a range of services to assist unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness, but little is known about their perceptions of drop-in centers or use of different services. A random sample of 273 youth experiencing homelessness in the Los Angeles area who had ever used a drop-in center was surveyed. Most youth heard about local drop-in centers from peers (65.1%). They generally reported positive perceptions of the drop-in center environment, staff, and clients; overall, 57.8% were "very" or "extremely" satisfied with the services they had received. Nearly all youth cited basic services (e.g., food, showers, clothes) as a reason they went to drop-in centers; far fewer reported going to obtain higher-level services (e.g., case management). Perceptions and utilization did not differ by sexual orientation; however, non-white youth were more likely than Whites to use drop-in centers for certain higher-level services. Strategies for engaging youth in drop-in center services are discussed.

N2  - AIMS/INTRODUCTION: The diabetes status of homeless people has not been elucidated because of the limited access to this population. We carried out a survey of the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes among homeless men in Nagoya, Japan, and assessed the associations between diabetes prevalence and sociodemographic characteristics., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Interviews relating to individuals' sociodemographic background, mental illness and cognitive ability, and blood sampling were carried out for 106 homeless men (mean age 54.2 +/- 12.7 years). Diabetes, prediabetes and normoglycemia were diagnosed according to the individual's hemoglobin A1c level: >=6.5%, 6.4-6.0% and <=5.9%, respectively. Mental illness and cognitive disability were diagnosed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III, respectively. Associations between the prevalence of diabetes/prediabetes and mental illness/cognitive disability or sociodemographic background were analyzed using the chi2 -test., RESULTS: Seven (6.6%) and 12 (11.3%) participants were diagnosed as having diabetes and prediabetes, respectively, which was a similar trend to that of general populations in Japan National Health and Nutrition Survey data. There was a significant difference in the prediabetes prevalence between groups with and without a history of having social support; however, no significant associations were found between the diabetes/prediabetes prevalence and mental illness/cognitive ability or participants' sociodemographic background., CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of diabetes in Japanese homeless men was similar to that in the general population, and the prediabetes incidence was lower in the group with social support than in that without. Early intervention for preventing diabetes and social support that focuses on diabetes management is important for homeless people. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Food insecurity is associated with childhood obesity possibly mediated through caregiver feeding practices and beliefs. We examined if caregiver feeding practices differed by household food security status in a diverse sample of infants. We hypothesized that feeding practices differ based on food security status., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Included in the baseline cross-sectional analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial to prevent obesity were 842 caregivers of 2-month-old infants presenting for well-child care at 4 academic institutions. Food insecurity exposure was based on an affirmative answer to 1 of 2 items in a 2-item validated questionnaire. Chi-square tests examined the association between parent feeding practices and food security status. Logistic regression adjusted for covariates. Differences in caregiver feeding practices by food security status and race/ethnicity were explored with an interaction term (food security status x race/ethnicity)., RESULTS: Forty-three percent of families screened as food insecure. In adjusted logistic regression, parents from food-insecure households were more likely to endorse that "the best way to make an infant stop crying is to feed him or her" (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-2.29) and "when my baby cries, I immediately feed him or her" (aOR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.06-1.83). Food-insecure caregivers less frequently endorsed paying attention to their baby when he or she is full or hungry (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34-0.96). Racial/ethnic differences in beliefs and behaviors were observed by food security status., CONCLUSIONS: During early infancy, feeding practices differed among caregivers by household food security status. Further research is needed to examine whether these practices are associated with increased risk of obesity and obesity-related morbidity. Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Child maltreatment is a complex and multifaceted construct in need of advanced statistical techniques to improve its measurement. The current study compared the predictive utility of a cumulative index to a factor analytic approach for constructing a measure of maltreatment. Data were from Waves III and IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Wave III: n = 14,800; Wave IV: n = 12,288). As adults, participants retrospectively reported on their childhood experiences of physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, supervisory neglect, and social services investigations. Both the cumulative index and a two-factor solution showed evidence of convergent validity, predicting lifetime incidence of homelessness, being paid for sex, and various measures of running away or living apart from biological parents, and prospectively predicting depression, substance use, and criminal behavior. The latent variables, derived from a factor analytic approach, had greater explanatory power for many outcomes compared to the cumulative index, even when controlling for sociodemographic variables. Results suggest that factor analysis is a better methodology than a cumulative index for measuring maltreatment in large datasets when explanatory power for external outcomes is of greatest concern.

N2  - AIM: Coupling data on future resource consumption with baseline characteristics can provide vital information of future consumption patterns for newly diagnosed patients. This study tested whether higher need (as measured by severity of illness) and other baseline characteristics of newly diagnosed patients were associated with higher future service costs., METHOD: Five hundred forty-seven patients between 18 and 45 years randomized to the OPUS trial was analysed in the study. Multiple regression analysis was applied to estimate the impact of the explanatory variables on mean total costs, which consisted of total health care costs and costs of supportive living facilities., RESULTS: Lower age, higher level of symptoms (global assessment of functioning), alcohol or cannabis misuse, and being homeless were associated with higher total costs over 5 years, whereas sex, duration of untreated psychosis, and educational level did not show any impact on future resource consumption., CONCLUSION: The association between future costs and severity of illness suggests that higher needs among patients were associated with higher resource input level. Our results also indicate that other factors than need might affect future costs, for example, parents who serve as advocates for young patients had impact on future health costs. We also found indications of potential barriers among patients with other citizenship in access to health-care services. The strength of the study is that resource data were extracted from official Danish registers and interviewers collected information on clinical characteristics. The results are likely to be context-specific but can be generalized to settings with similar treatment practices. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There is scarce evidence on prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among individuals who are homeless and diagnosed with severe mental illness. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of HCV infection and associated risk factors in a representative sample of adults from At Home study., METHODS: The Vancouver At Home study is part of the At Home/Chez Soi (AH/CS) project-a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of a Housing First intervention among homeless persons with mental illness in five Canadian cities between 2009 and 2013 with a 2-year follow-up period., RESULTS: Of 497 participants, 28% reported positive HCV serostatus. Educational level equal or less than eighth grade (AOR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 4.8), history of incarceration (AOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.5), substance dependence (AOR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.1, 3.7) and injection drug use during one month prior to the recruitment (AOR: 7.8, 95% CI: 4.0, 15.0) were associated with an increased risk of HCV infection. Having a psychotic disorder (AOR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.3, 1.0) and age < 25 (AOR: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.0, 0.7) were associated with a lower risk. Blood tests performed on 30 participants agreed with self-report in 97% of cases [Kappa = 0.9 (95% CI: 0.6, 1.3), PABAK = 0.9]., CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of HCV among individuals who were homeless with mental illness underlies the importance of prevention and treatment of HCV in this population, especially those with concurrent substance use disorders. Self-report seems to be a valid tool for evaluation of the HCV status in this population. Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Homelessness is a critical public health issue and socioeconomic epidemic associated with a disproportionate burden of disease and significant decrease in life expectancy. We compared emergency care utilization between individuals with documented homelessness to those enrolled in Medicaid without documented homelessness., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study consisting of electronic medical record review of demographics, chief complaints, and health care utilization metrics of adults with homelessness compared to a group enrolled in Medicaid without identified homelessness. The chart review spanned two years of emergency visits at a single urban, academic, tertiary care medical center. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariate analyses were utilized., RESULTS: Over the study period, 986 patients experiencing homelessness accounted for 7532 ED visits, with a mean of 7.6 (SD 19.9) and max of 316 visits. The control group of 3482 Medicaid patients had 5477 ED visits, with a mean of 1.6 visits (SD 2.1) and max of 49 visits. When controlling for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and ESI, those living with homelessness were 7.65 times more likely to return to the ED within 30days of their previous visit, 9.97 times more likely to return within 6months, 10.63 times more likely to return within one year, and 11 times more likely to return within 2years., CONCLUSIONS: Compared to non-homeless Medicaid patients, patients with documented homelessness were over seven times more likely to return to the ED within 30days and over eleven times more likely to return to the ED in two years.

N2  - This study considers risk associated with family homelessness for school functioning and experimental evidence on the effects of different housing interventions over time. Students in homeless families (N = 172; Mage = 7.31; SD = 4.15) were randomized to housing interventions that focus on acute risks (community-based rapid rehousing), chronic risks (permanent subsidy), or usual care (UC). A matched group of low-income, housed students served as an additional reference for effects on attendance, school mobility, and reading and math achievement across 4 years. Findings partially support the chronic-risk hypothesis that family homelessness interferes with achievement through its relation to deep poverty. Children randomly assigned to UC perform as well or better than children assigned to housing interventions in this municipality. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a combined strategy of human papillomavirus virus (HPV) vaccination and high-risk HPV screening to reduce the occurrence of anogenital and oropharyngeal neoplasms among men who have sex with men, people with HIV, homeless people, transgender women, female sex workers and rape victims., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This mixed methods study evaluates the effectiveness of a combined vaccination-screening strategy to reduce HPV prevalence/incidence and occurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasms grade 2+ and/or anal intraepithelial neoplasms grade 2+, using Kaplan-Meier. The time-to-event method will evaluate time from positive results for specific anogenital HPV to incidence of anogenital lesions containing that HPV type., RESULTS: People vaccinated against HPV and screened for HPV as a primary test will have lower prevalence and incidence of HPV infection and consequently lower frequency of HPV-related anogenital and oropharyngeal lesions., CONCLUSIONS: Thisstudy will generate scientific evidence on effectiveness of a combined vaccination-screening strategy to reduce the burden of HPV-associated neoplasms.

N2  - Abstract: Poor adherence to antipsychotics, which affects outcome, is frequent in first episode psychosis (FEP). Most randomized studies demonstrate no superiority of long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAI-AP) over oral antipsychotics (OAP). However, participants in these studies represent a minority of patients who may benefit from LAI-AP. Mirror and naturalistic studies generally demonstrate efficacy of LAI-AP on more representative samples, but studies on FEP are scarce., Aim: To describe LAI-AP's utilization and impact on FEP outcome in a naturalistic setting., Methods: A 3-year longitudinal prospective and retrospective descriptive study of all consecutive admissions from two Early Intervention Services for psychosis (EIS) in Montreal, Canada, compared the characteristics and evolution of patients who received LAI-AP for at least 12 months to those who received OAP only., Results: From 375 FEP patients included, 26,7% received LAI-AP during their follow-up. They were more likely to have poor prognostic factors (male gender, lower premorbid functioning, homelessness, substance use disorder and schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses). Despite a more severe illness and lower functioning in the LAI-AP group, at admission and study endpoint, clinical and functional improvements were observed., Conclusion: Early prescription of LAI-AP seems beneficial in FEP with poor prognostic factors.

N2  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious public health problem in many regions of the world, especially in the poorest areas. For this reason, screening for active and latent forms must be considered when dealing with high-risk groups such as irregular immigrants in Western countries. We conducted a retrospective cohort study by recruiting subjects aged >=15 years who underwent a tuberculin skin test at a dedicated National Health Service Centre in a northern Italian province between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013. These participants were followed up until 31 December 2016. We aimed at evaluating an experimental protocol for active and latent tuberculosis screening, focusing on patient compliance, feasibility, and capability to detect clinical forms of the disease. We enrolled 368 irregular immigrants, i.e., immigrants not having a valid residence permit and who were therefore not entitled to choose a general practitioner. In total, 90.22% of these completed all the steps for the screening of active TB, while 87.33% also undertook screening for the latent form of the disease. Homelessness, self-reported prostitution, female sex, and employment status adversely affected compliance. Chronic alcohol consumption was associated with increased risk of no beginning or interruption of the procedures. All of the five patients with active TB successfully completed the treatment. Overall, adherence to the screening program was high compared to other studies in immigrants, possibly owing to organizational factors such as the availability of cultural mediators, the network between the different health services, the presence of dedicated nursing staff and a free-of-charge service. In addition, selected vulnerable subgroups should be targeted using tailored screening and follow-up programs.

T1  - Substance use and social stability of homeless youth: A comparison of three interventions.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - The current study identified subgroups of homeless youth and young adults that exhibited distinct co-occurring patterns of substance use and social stability (e.g., employment, school attendance, and housing), and evaluated the relative effectiveness of the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA), Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), and case management (CM) in interrupting substance use and improving social stability. The differentiating effects of personal characteristics on the co-occurrence of substance use and social stability were also examined. Participants included 270 homeless youth and young adults who were randomly assigned to one of the three intervention conditions: CRA, n = 93, MET, n = 86, or CM, n = 91. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months postbaseline. A dual trajectory latent class growth analysis identified four co-occurring patterns: low-stable substance use paired with low-increasing social stability, high-stable substance use paired with low-stable social stability, high-declining substance use paired with low-increasing social stability, and low-increasing substance use paired with high-stable social stability. Findings showed that CRA was superior in improving substance use and social stability simultaneously compared to MET and CM, and further, CM was more effective than MET. Personal factors including race, age, coping strategies, and behavior problems differentiated the co-occurring patterns of substance use and social stability. The findings underscore the significance in identifying subgroups of homeless youth that vary in problem severity in terms of their substance use and social stability, and offer evidence to help practitioners identify the most effective intervention that responds to the needs of homeless youth.

N2  - Virtual Reality (VR) has been increasingly referred to as the "ultimate empathy machine" since it allows users to experience any situation from any point of view. However, empirical evidence supporting the claim that VR is a more effective method of eliciting empathy than traditional perspective-taking is limited. Two experiments were conducted in order to compare the short and long-term effects of a traditional perspective-taking task and a VR perspective-taking task (Study 1), and to explore the role of technological immersion when it comes to different types of mediated perspective-taking tasks (Study 2). Results of Study 1 show that over the course of eight weeks participants in both conditions reported feeling empathetic and connected to the homeless at similar rates, however, participants who became homeless in VR had more positive, longer-lasting attitudes toward the homeless and signed a petition supporting the homeless at a significantly higher rate than participants who performed a traditional perspective-taking task. Study 2 compared three different types of perspective-taking tasks with different levels of immersion (traditional vs. desktop computer vs. VR) and a control condition (where participants received fact-driven information about the homeless). Results show that participants who performed any type of perspective-taking task reported feeling more empathetic and connected to the homeless than the participants who only received information. Replicating the results from Study 1, there was no difference in self-report measures for any of the perspective-taking conditions, however, a significantly higher number of participants in the VR condition signed a petition supporting affordable housing for the homeless compared to the traditional and less immersive conditions. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

N2  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) against women and food insecurity are an ever growing public health concerns in Ethiopia. However, the connection between the two is not yet well investigated. Therefore, this study compares IPV by household food security status and examines the association between IPV and food insecurity and among currently married women in childbearing age in Arba Minch town, South Ethiopia. A community based comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among 696 currently married women (15-49). A quantitative data was collected using a pretested and structured questionnaire on randomly selected women. Logistic regression was done using IBM SPSS version 20. Statistical significance was declared at p-value of less than 0.05 and odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval was used to show the degree of association. Lifetime and current IPV were 62.4% and 50%, respectively. Sixty-three (23.6%) and 285 (66.4%) women who experienced current IPV were from food secured and insecure households, respectively (P-value<0.001). The odds of experiencing current IPV were higher among women from food insecure households (AOR=6.59,95% CI(4.54,9.57)) and who were in the age range of 30-39 (AOR=2.16, 95% CI(1.34,3.56)) and it was lower among women with 10 and more years age difference with their husband (AOR=0.52, 95% CI (0.31,0.88)) and with high decision-making power (AOR=0.61, 95% CI (0.38.0.96)) than their reference groups. The prevalence of current IPV was significantly higher among women from food insecure households as compared to their counterparts. The odds of experiencing current IPV were higher among women from food insecure households. Policy makers and programme planners should consider improving urban women's household food security status in order to improve gender inequality and empower women. Multisectorial effort is needed to improve women education and other behavioral factors.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In 2012, Massachusetts changed its emergency shelter eligibility policy for homeless families. One new criterion to document homelessness was staying in a location "not meant for human habitation," and the emergency department (ED) fulfilled this requirement. Our aim for this study is to analyze the frequency and costs of pediatric ED visits for homelessness before and after this policy., METHODS: This is a retrospective study of ED visits for homelessness at a children's hospital from March 2010 to February 2016. A natural language processing tool was used to identify cases, which were manually reviewed for inclusion. We compared demographic and homelessness circumstance characteristics and conducted an interrupted time series analysis to compare ED visits by homeless children before and after the policy. We compared the change in ED visits for homelessness to the number of homeless children in Massachusetts. We analyzed payment data for each visit., RESULTS: There were 312 ED visits for homelessness; 95% (n = 297) of visits were after the policy. These visits increased 4.5 times after the policy (95% confidence interval: 1.33 to 15.23). Children seen after the policy were more likely to have no medical complaint (rate ratio: 3.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.18 to 9.01). Although the number of homeless children in Massachusetts increased 1.4 times over the study period, ED visits for homelessness increased 13-fold. Payments (average: $557 per visit) were >4 times what a night in a shelter would cost; 89% of payments were made through state-based insurance plans., CONCLUSIONS: A policy change to Massachusetts' shelter eligibility was associated with increased pediatric ED visits for homelessness along with substantial health care costs.

N2  - What housing and service interventions work best to reduce homelessness for families in the United States? The Family Options Study randomly assigned 2,282 families recruited in homeless shelters across 12 sites to priority access to one of three active interventions or to usual care in their communities. The interventions were long-term rent subsidies, short-term rent subsidies, and transitional housing in supervised programs with intensive psychosocial services. In two waves of follow-up data collected 20and 37 months later, priority access to long-term rent subsidies reduced homelessness sand food insecurity and improved other aspects of adult and child well-being relative to usual care, at a cost 9 percent higher. The other interventions had little effect. The study provides support for the view that homelessness for most families is an economic problem that long-term rent subsidies resolve and does not support the view that families must address psychosocial problems to succeed in housing. It has implications for focusing government resources on this important social problem.

N2  - The effects of a resilience enhancement programme on resilience, depression, anxiety, and problem drinking among female runaway youths living in shelters were evaluated. Participants were 32 youths (16 experimental and 16 control participants), assessed at pre-test, post-test, and one-month follow-up. The programme incorporated five protective factors associated with resilience: self-esteem, self-regulation, relational skills, problem-solving skills, and goal-setting skills. There were significant group-by-time interaction effects for resilience, anxiety, and problem drinking at one-month follow-up. The preliminary results suggest that providing female runaway youths with this programme focusing on protective factors may enhance resilience and mitigate anxiety, and problem drinking.

N2  - AIM: To assess the acceptability for GPS to use the French shared Electronic Health Record (Dossier Medical Partage, "DMP") when caring for Homeless People (HP)., METHODS: Mixed, sequential, qualitative-quantitative study. The qualitative phase consisted of semi-structured interviews with GPs involved in the care of HP. During the quantitative phase, questionnaires were sent to 150 randomized GPs providing routine healthcare in Marseille. Social and practical acceptability was studied by means of a Likert Scale., RESULTS: 19 GPs were interviewed during the qualitative phase, and 105 GPs answered the questionnaire during the quantitative phase (response rate: 73%). GPs had a poor knowledge about DMP. More than half (52.5%) of GPs were likely to effectively use DMP for HP. GPs felt that the "DMP" could improve continuity, quality, and security of care for HP. They perceived greater benefits of the use the DMP for HP than for the general population, notably in terms of saving time (p = 0.03). However, GPs felt that HP were vulnerable and wanted to protect their patients; they worried about security of data storage. GPs identified specific barriers for HP to use DMP: most of them concerned practical access for HP to DMP (lack of social security card, or lack of tool for accessing internet)., CONCLUSION: A shared electronic health record, such as the French DMP, could improve continuity of care for HP in France. GPs need to be better informed, and DMP functions need to be optimized and adapted to HP, so that it can be effectively used by GPs for HP.

N2  - Importance: Previous studies have shown high mortality rates among homeless people in general, but little is known about the patterns of mortality among "rough sleepers," the subgroup of unsheltered urban homeless people who avoid emergency shelters and primarily sleep outside., Objectives: To assess the mortality rates and causes of death for a cohort of unsheltered homeless adults from Boston, Massachusetts., Design, Setting, and Participants: A 10-year prospective cohort study (2000-2009) of 445 unsheltered homeless adults in Boston, Massachusetts, who were seen during daytime street and overnight van clinical visits performed by the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program's Street Team during 2000. Data used to describe the unsheltered homeless cohort and to document causes of death were gathered from clinical encounters, medical records, the National Death Index, and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health death occurrence files. The study data set was linked to the death occurrence files by using a probabilistic record linkage program to confirm the deaths. Data analysis was performed from May 1, 2015, to September 6, 2016., Exposure: Being unsheltered in an urban setting., Main Outcomes and Measures: Age-standardized all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates and age-stratified incident rate ratios that were calculated for the unsheltered adult cohort using 2 comparison groups: the nonhomeless Massachusetts adult population and an adult homeless cohort from Boston who slept primarily in shelters., Results: Of 445 unsheltered adults in the study cohort, the mean (SD) age at enrollment was 44 (11.4) years, 299 participants (67.2%) were non-Hispanic white, and 72.4% were men. Among the 134 individuals who died, the mean (SD) age at death was 53 (11.4) years. The all-cause mortality rate for the unsheltered cohort was almost 10 times higher than that of the Massachusetts population (standardized mortality rate, 9.8; 95% CI, 8.2-11.5) and nearly 3 times higher than that of the adult homeless cohort (standardized mortality rate, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.3-3.2). Non-Hispanic black individuals had more than half the rate of death compared with non-Hispanic white individuals, with a rate ratio of 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.7; P < .001). The most common causes of death were noncommunicable diseases (eg, cancer and heart disease), alcohol use disorder, and chronic liver disease., Conclusions and Relevance: Mortality rates for unsheltered homeless adults in this study were higher than those for the Massachusetts adult population and a sheltered adult homeless cohort with equivalent services. This study suggests that this distinct subpopulation of homeless people merits special attention to meet their unique clinical and psychosocial needs.

N2  - The purpose of this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to compare the 6-month outcomes of a Dialectical Behavioral Therapy-Corrections Modified (DBT-CM) program versus a Health Promotion (HP) program on mitigating recidivism among 130 female parolees/probationers between baseline and 6-month follow-up. The effect of DBT-CM on reducing recidivism was greater among those who expressed a desire for help (risk ratio [RR] = 0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.16, 1.00]; p = .050) and among homeless female ex-offenders (HFOs) who were younger (<50 years of age; RR = 0.46; 95% CI = [0.19, 1.11]; p = .085) and participants with Desire for Help score > 35 (Model 3; RR = 0.40; 95% CI = [0.16, 1.00]; p = .050). Findings from this pilot study suggest that the DBT-CM intervention may be effective in reducing reincarceration rates among some HFOs during reentry. Larger RCTs are needed to validate our findings.

N2  - Inadequate housing and homelessness among families represent a substantial challenge for child and adolescent well-being. Child welfare services confront housing that threatens placement into foster care with little resources and evidence to guide practice. The present study provides the first rigorous test of the Family Unification Program (FUP) - a federal program that offers housing subsidies for inadequately housed families under investigation for child maltreatment. A randomized controlled trial assesses program impact on foster care placement and costs. The experiment referred intact child welfare-involved families whose inadequate housing threatened foster placement in Chicago, IL to FUP plus housing advocacy (n = 89 families with 257 children) or housing advocacy alone (n = 89 families with 257 children). Families were referred from 2011 to 2013, and administrative data recorded dates and costs of foster placements over a 3-year follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses suggested families randomly assigned for FUP exhibited slower increases in rates of foster placement following housing intervention compared with families referred for housing advocacy alone. The program generates average savings of nearly $500 per family per year to the foster care system. Housing subsidies provide the foster care system small but significant benefits for keeping homeless families together. Findings inform the design of a coordinated child welfare response to housing insecurity. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Direct-acting antivirals (DAA) have dramatically increased HCV cure rates with minimal toxicity in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. This study aimed to compare the socio-behavioral characteristics of patients initiating pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN)-based HCV treatment with those of patients initiating DAA-based treatment., METHODS: ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH is a national multicenter prospective cohort started in 2005, which enrolled 1,859 HIV-HCV co-infected patients followed up in French hospital outpatient units. Both clinical/biological and socio-behavioral data were collected during follow-up. We selected patients with socio-behavioral data available before HCV treatment initiation., RESULTS: A total of 580 patients were included in this analysis. Of these, 347 initiated PEG-IFN-based treatment, and 233 DAA-based treatment. There were significant differences regarding patient mean age (45 years+/-6 for the PEG-IFN group vs. 52 years+/-8 for the DAA group, p<0.001), unstable housing (21.4% vs. 11.2%, p = 0.0016), drug use (44.7% vs. 29.6%, p = 0.0003), regular or daily use of cannabis (24.3% vs. 15.6%, p = 0.0002), a history of drug injection (68.9% vs 39.0%, p<0.0001) and significant liver fibrosis (62.4% vs 72.3%, p = 0.0293). In multivariable analysis, patients initiating DAA-based treatment were older than their PEG-IFN-based treatment counterparts (aOR = 1.17; 95%CI [1.13; 1.22]). Patients receiving DAA treatment were less likely to report unstable housing (0.46 [0.24; 0.88]), cannabis use (regular or daily use:0.50 [0.28; 0.91]; non-regular use: 0.41 [0.22; 0.77]), and a history of drug injection (0.19 [0.12; 0.31])., CONCLUSION: It is possible that a majority of patients who had socio-economic problems and/or a history of drug injection and/or a non-advanced disease stage were already treated for HCV in the PEG-IFN era. Today, patients with unstable housing conditions are prescribed DAA less frequently than other populations. As HCV treatment is prevention, improving access to DAA remains a major clinical and public health strategy, in particular for individuals with high-risk behaviors.

N2  - This study aims to examine the relationship between the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and 14-year outcomes of schizophrenia in a Chinese rural area. Participants with schizophrenia (n=510) were identified in an epidemiological investigation of 123 572 people aged 15 years and older in 1994 and followed up in 2008 in Xinjin, Chengdu, China. Longer DUP (>6 months) was common in participants (27.3%). In 1994, participants with DUP <= 6 months were more likely to have a significantly lower rate of suicide attempts, shorter duration of illness and higher rate of full remission compared with those with DUP>6 months. No significant differences were found regarding the rates of survival, suicide, death due to other causes and homelessness between individuals with shorter and longer DUP in 2008. Nevertheless, longer DUP (>6 months) of participants in 2008 was significantly associated with higher mean of PANSS total negative and general mental scores, longer duration of illness and higher rate of live alone in the logistic regression model. Earlier identification, treatment and rehabilitation, and family intervention should be addressed when developing mental health policies and delivering community mental health services.

N2  - Physical inactivity is estimated to be the fourth leading cause of global mortality. Strategies to increase physical activity (PA) increasingly emphasize environmental and policy changes including the modification of neighborhood environments to promote walking and other forms of healthy activity. Open Streets (OS) initiatives, an important and growing strategy to modify neighborhood environments for PA, create temporary parks for recreational activity by closing streets to motor vehicle traffic, thereby offering health and community building benefits. We used the Stanford Neighborhood Discovery Tool (DT)-photo/voice software on a tablet-to train neighborhood residents to act as "citizen scientist" observers of the local built environment on a non-event day and during an OS initiative. The purposes of this project were as follows: (1) to assess adult residents' perceptions of neighborhood characteristics of the OS initiative in three socioeconomically diverse sites and (2) to test the DT for use in three international urban settings with OS initiatives; Bogota, Colombia; San Francisco, USA; and Temuco, Chile, among a multigenerational, multiethnic sample of adults including, for the first time, a vulnerable population of homeless adults (Bogota). Using the DT, participants walked an OS route taking photos and recording reasons for the photos, then completed a 25-item demographic/environmental observation survey and a 16-item Reflection Survey on perceived environmental changes. A total of 18 themes were reported by participants with areas of overlapping themes (e.g., Community and Social Connectedness) and areas where a single site reported a theme (e.g., Social Isolation in Older Adults). Ten of the 18 themes were identified by at least two sites including "Bike Resources" and "Services", indicating the value of programming at OS initiatives. The themes of "Festive Environment" and "Family Friendly Environment" reflect the quality of the overall environment for participants. Four themes (Community and Social Connectedness, Family Friendly Environment, PA, and Safety) were reported by all sites. Three of the four unifying themes were also ranked among the highest reported categories of "seemed better" on the Reflection Survey (Ease of Walking, Overall Safety of Neighborhood, and Friendliness of Environment), providing additional confirmation of the shared experience of social, health, and psychological benefits from OS initiatives. OS initiatives offer a global strategy for increasing neighborhood opportunities for PA and a potential site for training citizen scientists to document environmental influences on PA.

T1  - Frostbite vs Burns: Increased Cost of Care and Use of Hospital Resources.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Numerous demographic, socioeconomic, and injury factors influence a burn patient's hospital course. Compared to the typical burn patient, frostbite injury frequently impacts those with high rates of mental illness, substance abuse, and those suffering homelessness. Our aim was to examine differences in the hospital course of frostbite patients compared to those with burns limited to the hands and feet. Patients with frostbite injury and those with isolated hand and/or foot burns were identified in the National Burn Repository. The database was cleaned based on published protocols. Patients were excluded if they had an inhalation injury recorded or unknown. Patients with frostbite injury were significantly older and more likely to be male. Frostbite patients were less frequently covered by commercial insurance (25.3% vs 41.7%). Mean total BSA (TBSA) did not differ between the two groups (frostbite: 2.1 and burn: 1.7, P = .195). The mean intensive care unit (ICU) days and requirement for mechanical ventilation were not significantly different between the two groups, however frostbite patients were significantly more likely to require ICU care (26.5% vs 13.7%, P = .002). Hospital length of stay (LOS) was significantly longer in frostbite patients (8.1 vs 4.0 days, P < .001) and hospital charges were significantly higher in frostbite patients ($43,400 vs $15,600, P < .001). Factors associated with increased hospital charges included mechanism, age, gender, race, TBSA, hospital LOS, ICU, and mechanical ventilation. Factors associated with increased LOS included mechanism, age, gender, race, TBSA, ICU stay, and mechanical ventilation. On multivariate analysis, all factors, except gender, remained independent predictors of increased hospital LOS. A comparison of similarly injured patients treated at burn centers showed frostbite injury as a significant predictor of increased LOS and hospital costs compared to burn-injured patients.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To review empirical evaluations of individual-level interventions intended to improve mental health or well-being for vulnerable adolescents., STUDY DESIGN: This is a systematic mapping review., METHODS: Thirteen databases covering academic and gray literature were searched for published reviews and randomised controlled trials, and gray literature (2005-2016) and the results quality-assessed to prioritise best available evidence. We aimed to identify well-conducted systematic reviews and trials that evaluated individual-level interventions, for mental health/well-being outcomes, where the population was adolescents aged 10-24 years in any of 12 vulnerable groups at high risk of poor health outcomes (e.g. homeless, offenders, 'looked after', carers)., RESULTS: Thirty systematic reviews and 16 additional trials were identified. There was insufficient evidence to identify promising individual-level interventions that improve the mental health/well-being of any of the vulnerable groups., CONCLUSIONS: Despite Western policy to promote health and well-being among vulnerable young people, the dearth of evidence suggests a lack of interest in evaluating interventions targeting these groups in respect of their mental health/well-being outcomes.

N2  - Data from two studies of transgender women in Los Angeles County that used the same methodology and survey assessment (Study 1: 1998-1999, N = 244; Study 2: 2015-2016, N = 271), compared structural determinants of health, HIV/STI prevalence, HIV risk behaviors, substance use, gender confirmation procedures, and perceived discrimination and harassment/abuse across a 17-year time period. Findings demonstrated that participants in the latter study reported significantly higher access to healthcare insurance and prescription hormones. However, participants in the latter study also reported lower levels of income; and, elevated prevalence of homelessness, HIV and lifetime STIs, receptive condomless anal intercourse with casual partner(s), and reported physical harassment/abuse. Given the timeframe of these results, these findings elucidate specific areas of transgender women's health and risk profiles that improved or worsened across 17 years. While healthcare access has improved, transgender women continue to face significant barriers to good health, indicating the need for increased attention to this population.

N2  - It is unknown whether providing housing to persons experiencing homelessness decreases HIV risk. Housing, including access to preventive services and counseling, might provide a period of transition for persons with HIV risk factors. We assessed whether the new HIV diagnosis rate was associated with duration of supportive housing. We linked data from a cohort of 21,689 persons without a previous HIV diagnosis who applied to a supportive housing program in New York City (NYC) during 2007-2013 to the NYC HIV surveillance registry. We used time-dependent Cox modeling to compare new HIV diagnoses among recipients of supportive housing (defined a priori, for program evaluation purposes, as persons who spent > 7 days in supportive housing; n = 6447) and unplaced applicants (remainder of cohort), after balancing the groups on baseline characteristics with propensity score weights. Compared with unplaced applicants, persons who received >= 3 continuous years of supportive housing had decreased risk for new HIV diagnosis (HR 0.10; CI 0.01-0.99). Risk of new HIV diagnosis decreased with longer duration placement in supportive housing. Supportive housing might aid in primary HIV prevention.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We compared the US-derived Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) home visiting programme when added to usually provided health and social care for first-time teenage mothers, to usual care alone. We aimed to: establish the nature of usual care, measure service usage and assess performance bias in core usual care services., DESIGN: Within trial process evaluation. Local professionals completed a survey mapping local health and social care services in seven domains. This focused on services available to young women, especially those relevant to pregnant teenagers. Descriptive data were assessed thematically to establish the range of services. Quantitative data collection with FNP supervisors enumerated service provision by site. Services identified were included in main participant trial follow-up interviews at four time points to quantify usage. Usage was described descriptively by domain. We explored predictors of health visitor visits., SETTING: 18 partnerships of local authority and healthcare organisations in England., OUTCOMES: Descriptive framework of services. Rates of service usage reported by trial participants., RESULTS: 161 separate services were identified, with multiple service models in each domain, broadly categorised as universal or specialist (eg, for teenage mothers). FNP supervisors identified 30-63 universal services per site and 22-67 specialist services. Use of core maternity care services was similar across trial arms and with only small differences in use of health visiting services. Participants accessed a wide range of services. Women who had ever been homeless, who had a higher subjectively defined social status, and poorer mental health received more visits from a health visitor., CONCLUSIONS: The large number of services available to teenage mothers in England may limit the incremental benefit achievable through enhanced home visiting. There was little evidence of compensatory practice, such as additional care for women in the usual care arm. Measuring usual care when trialling complex interventions is challenging and essential., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN23019866.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prevalence is high, but not well-understood, among women living in urban, impoverished areas. Although previous studies have established social support as an important factor in PTSD development and maintenance, little is known about how perceptions of neighborhood are linked to PTSD. This study examined the relationship between PTSD and social network and neighborhood factors among women with a low socioeconomic status., METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data collected from a human immunodeficiency virus/sexually transmitted infection peer network study in Baltimore, Maryland (n = 438). We used bivariate analyses to examine the associations between PTSD and social network characteristics and time in neighborhood and satisfaction. We then constructed multivariable regression models that controlled for the following with PTSD: homelessness, cocaine/heroin use, and unemployment., MAIN FINDINGS: Overall, 30% of women had PTSD symptom severity consistent with a clinical diagnosis. In the multivariable model, dissatisfaction with neighborhood block (odds ratio [OR], 1.80; p = .03) and living in one's neighborhood for more than 5 years (OR, 1.69; p = .03) were associated with PTSD. Social network factors that were significantly associated with PTSD included a higher number of network members in conflict with the participant (OR, 1.28; p = .02), presence of a network member who would let the participant stay with them (OR, 0.4; p = .004), and the number of network members with whom the participant socialized (OR, 0.6; p = .04)., CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of impoverished urban women with a high prevalence of PTSD, duration of residency, satisfaction with neighborhood, and network characteristics were found to be strongly associated with PTSD symptom severity.

N2  - AIMS: To test the acceptability and feasibility of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of mood and injection risk behavior among young people who inject drugs (PWID), using mobile phones., METHODS: Participants were 185 PWID age 18-35 recruited from two sites of a large syringe service program in Chicago. After completing a baseline interview, participants used a mobile phone app to respond to momentary surveys on mood, substance use, and injection risk behavior for 15days. Participants were assigned to receive surveys 4, 5, or 6 times per day., RESULTS: Participants were 68% male, 61% non-Hispanic white, 24% Hispanic, and 5% non-Hispanic Black. Out of 185 participants, 8% (n=15) failed to complete any EMA assessments. Among 170 EMA responders, the mean number of days reporting was 10 (SD 4.7), the mean proportion of assessments completed was 0.43 (SD 0.27), and 76% (n=130) completed the follow-up interview. In analyses adjusted for age and race/ethnicity, women were more responsive than men to the EMA surveys in days reporting (IRR=1.33, 95% CI 1.13-1.56), and total number of surveys completed (IRR=1.51, 95% CI 1.18-1.93). Homeless participants responded on fewer days (IRR=0.76, 95% CI 0.64-0.90) and completed fewer surveys (IRR=0.70, 95% CI 0.54-0.91), and were less likely to return for follow-up (p=0.016). EMA responsiveness was not significantly affected by the number of assigned daily assessments., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated high acceptability and feasibility of EMA among young PWID, with up to 6 survey prompts per day. However, homelessness significantly hampered successful participation. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Frequent emergency department (ED) visits often suggest inappropriate use for low acuity needs and multiple comorbidities, including substance use disorders., OBJECTIVE: This study examines associations of individuals and their social networks with high frequency ED use among persons reporting substance use., METHODS: Information was obtained from interview responses from the first 6-month follow-up visit of a longitudinal. Prevalence ratios for the outcome of high frequency ED visits (>=2 in 6 months) were determined with a generalized linear model, log link, Poisson distribution and robust standard errors., RESULTS: Of 653 participants, 131 (20%) had >=2 ED visits. In multivariable analysis, greater likelihood of high frequency ED visits over 6 months was associated with being homeless (PR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.10), taking >=3 medications (PR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.10) and having had a hospitalization over the same period (PR: 4.33; 95% CI: 3.26, 7.56). Among social network factors, lower likelihood of high frequency visits was associated with each increasing year of mean alter age (PR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.6, 0.99) and greater likelihood with having received health-related informational support from >=2 alters (PR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.53). Conclusions /Importance: Social network factors may play an important role in ED use. Interventions to promote health behaviors through social influence may be helpful in reducing high frequency ED visits.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Brazil is among the nations with the greatest rates of annual cocaine usage. Pharmacological treatment of cocaine addiction is still limited, opening space for nonconventional interventions. Homeopathic Q-potencies of opium and Erythroxylum coca have been tested in the integrative treatment of cocaine craving among homeless addicts, but this setting had not proven feasible, due to insufficient recruitment., OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the effectiveness and tolerability of homeopathic Q-potencies of opium and E. coca in the integrative treatment of cocaine craving in a community-based psychosocial rehabilitation setting., DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, eight-week pilot trial was performed at the Psychosocial Attention Center for Alcohol and Other Drugs (CAPS-AD), Sao Carlos/SP, Brazil. Eligible subjects included CAPS-AD patients between 18 and 65years of age, with an International Classification of Diseases-10 diagnosis of cocaine dependence (F14.2). The patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: psychosocial rehabilitation plus homeopathic Q-potencies of opium and E. coca (homeopathy group), and psychosocial rehabilitation plus indistinguishable placebo (placebo group)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was the percentage of cocaine-using days. Secondary measures were the Minnesota Cocaine Craving Scale and 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey scores. Adverse events were reported in both groups., RESULTS: The study population comprised 54 patients who attended at least one post-baseline assessment, out of the 104 subjects initially enrolled. The mean percentage of cocaine-using days in the homeopathy group was 18.1% (standard deviation (SD): 22.3%), compared to 29.8% (SD: 30.6%) in the placebo group (P<0.01). Analysis of the Minnesota Cocaine Craving Scale scores showed no between-group differences in the intensity of cravings, but results significantly favored homeopathy over placebo in the proportion of weeks without craving episodes and the patients' appraisal of treatment efficacy for reduction of cravings. Analysis of 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey scores found no significant differences. Few adverse events were reported: 0.57 adverse events/patient in the homeopathy group compared to 0.69 adverse events/patient in the placebo group (P=0.41)., CONCLUSIONS: A psychosocial rehabilitation setting improved recruitment but was not sufficient to decrease dropout frequency among Brazilian cocaine treatment seekers. Psychosocial rehabilitation plus homeopathic Q-potencies of opium and E. coca were more effective than psychosocial rehabilitation alone in reducing cocaine cravings. Due to high dropout rate and risk of bias, further research is required to confirm our findings, with specific focus on strategies to increase patient retention., TRIAL REGISTRATION: RBR-2xzcwz (http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br).

T1  - A comparison of risk factors for various forms of trauma in the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and heterosexual homeless youth.

N2  - Numerous homeless youth experience trauma prior to leaving home and while on the street. Bullying and trading sex (i.e. exchanging sexual favors for survival items such as food) are additional forms of trauma experienced by many homeless youth. Although lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) homeless youth experience higher rates of child abuse compared to their heterosexual counterparts, there is a paucity of research comparing these two groups. As such, we compare whether difficulties finding items of necessity (e.g. food) and different forms of trauma including child sexual abuse, being bullied, trading sex, and street sexual victimization significantly differ for LGB and heterosexual homeless youth. Bivariate results reveal that LGB youth have more trouble finding shelter and are more likely to trade sex compared to heterosexual youth. Logistic regression results show that trading sex is correlated with street sexual victimization. In the second model, we find that being female, experiencing more child sexual abuse, and ever having traded sex are all positively linked with street sexual victimization. LGB youth are over-represented among homeless youth populations and are also more likely to trade sex; therefore, these young people need services that are widely accessible and specific to their needs.

N2  - Background: Homelessness is associated with increased mortality, morbidity and social difficulties and periods of homelessness are sometimes prolonged or repeated. However, there are no long-term follow-up studies focusing upon housing status among homeless people. The aim of this study was to examine morbidity and housing outcomes and to identify factors predicting being independently housed 10 years after shelter use., Methods: By combining data from several registers we followed all 552 homeless men who stayed in shelter in Helsinki during 2004 and determined their housing situation and morbidity 10 years later. Their situation was compared with an age-matched control group from the general population (N = 946). Using logistic regression analysis, we assessed the predictive effects of socioeconomic factors and health service use at baseline on becoming independently housed., Results: By the end of the follow-up 52.0% of the formerly homeless study group had died, compared with 14.6% of the controls. At 10 years, 6.0% were independently housed, 37.5% lived in supported housing and 4.5% were still or again homeless. Psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorder, were present in 77.5% of the homeless, compared with 16.1% among the controls. Being married (OR 8.3, 95% CI 3.0 to 23.2) and having less than four shelter nights in year 2004 (OR 9.1, 95% CI 2.7 to 30.8) strongly predicted being independently housed 10 years later., Conclusions: Homeless staying in shelters have high mortality and morbidity and most of those surviving, are in need of support in their everyday lives even years after the shelter period.

N2  - The number of women under community supervision in the United States has increased, and this population has a high risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We examined STI prevalence and multiple risk factors among drug-involved women under community supervision in New York City. Data were from a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of a behavioral HIV/STI intervention (Women on the Road to Health [WORTH]) among drug-involved women in the community corrections system in New York City from 2009 to 2012. To be eligible for inclusion, women had to be under community supervision within the past 90 days, have used illicit drugs at least once in the past six months, and have unprotected sex at least once in the past 90 days. Participants completed a survey containing items on STI risk factors and were tested for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Multivariable regression was used to examine associations between risk factors and STI diagnosis. Of 333 women tested, 89 (26.7%) tested positive for an STI. Ten (3.0%) were positive for C. trachomatis, 4 (1.2%) for N. gonorrhoeae, and 77 (23.1%) for T. vaginalis. Women with any STI were more likely to be black (AOR: 2.02; 95% CI: 1.08-3.77), homeless in the past 90 days (AOR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.01-4.26), arrested in the past 90 days (AOR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.14-3.39), and have a greater number of sexual partners in the past 90 days (AOR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.08-1.42). Drug-using women under community supervision have a high burden of STIs driven by multiple risk factors. Implementing STI screening, prevention, and treatment programs in community supervision settings could facilitate a reduction in STIs among this population.

N2  - We employ a social stress framework, which examines the influence of multiple stressors (e.g., physical abuse, foster care placement) on an individual's ability to function (e.g., mental well-being), to longitudinally examine the effects of stressful life events on mental health and the role of the social environment in this process among 150 homeless youth. Results revealed that numerous stressors, such as physical abuse and running away from home more frequently, were associated with greater depressive symptoms and elevated anxiety. Having mentors and family and friends from home that youth can rely on resulted in more positive social support, which subsequently lowered the risk for depressive symptoms and anxiety at wave 2.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Kids Cafe Program (KCP) nutrition education and assess its impact on children's diet quality and body mass index (BMI) percentile., DESIGN: An experimental design consisting of pretest-posttest comparison groups using mixed methods to evaluate a 6-session nutrition education intervention., SETTING: Four Boys and Girls Club sites PARTICIPANTS: A total of 120 9- to 12-year-old children in the KCP (60 intervention and 60 comparison); 89% completed posttest evaluations., INTERVENTION: Trained KCP site staff taught the nutrition education curriculum at intervention sites., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Healthy Eating Index-2010 using 24-hour dietary recall data (primary) and BMI percentile (secondary) ANALYSIS: Repeated-measures mixed-effects modeling RESULTS: Mean age of children was 10.2 years; mean BMI percentile was about 79; 95% were from food-insecure households. The total Healthy Eating Index-2010 score for both groups at baseline and posttest ranged from 50 to 60. At posttest, compared with baseline scores, children from both groups scored significantly lower for total vegetables, and greens and beans; the intervention group children had significantly higher sodium scores. Process evaluation indicated that 60-minute lecture-based sessions were too long after children were in school all day., CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that the KCP nutrition education curriculum needs improvement. Further research based on behavioral constructs is needed to refine the curriculum to encourage healthier food choices among children and using the MyPlate and the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nonmedical prescription opioid (NMPO) use is a problem among young adults, yet young NMPO users are a diverse population that has been challenging to engage in overdose prevention and harm reduction programs., OBJECTIVES: This study compared the effectiveness and characteristics of persons recruited through two different sampling strategies to inform research and intervention efforts with young adult NMPO users., METHODS: We analyzed data from the Rhode Island Young Adult Prescription Drug Study (RAPiDS), which enrolled persons aged 18 to 29 who reported past 30-day NMPO use. We compared the characteristics of two samples recruited simultaneously between February 2015 and February 2016. One sample was recruited using field-based strategies (e.g., respondent-driven sampling, transit ads), and a second from internet sources (e.g., online classifieds)., RESULTS: Among 198 eligible participants, the median age was 25 (IQR: 22, 27), 130 (65.7%) were male, 123 (63.1%) were white, and 150 (78.1%) resided in urban areas. A total of 79 (39.9%) were recruited using field-based strategies and 119 (60.1%) were recruited from internet sources. Internet-recruited persons were younger (median = 24 [IQR: 21, 27] vs. 26 [IQR: 23, 28] years) and more likely to reside in rural areas (16.2% vs. 5.3%), although this finding was marginally significant. Field-recruited participants were more likely to have been homeless (36.7% vs. 17.7%), have been incarcerated (39.7% vs. 21.8%), and engage in daily NMPO use (34.6% vs. 14.5%)., CONCLUSIONS: Multipronged outreach methods are needed to engage the full spectrum of young adult NMPO users in prevention and harm reduction efforts.

N2  - Intervention adaptation is a promising approach for extending the reach of evidence-based interventions to underserved families. One highly relevant population in need of services are homeless families. In particular, homeless families with children constitute more than one third of the total homeless population in the United States and face several unique challenges to parenting. The purpose of this study was to adapt and pilot test a parenting intervention for homeless families in transitional housing. An established adaptation model was used to guide this process. The systematic adaptation efforts included: (a) examining the theory of change in the original intervention, (b) identifying population differences relevant to homeless families in transitional housing, (c) adapting the content of the intervention, and (d) adapting the evaluation strategy. Next, a pilot test of the adapted intervention was conducted to examine implementation feasibility and acceptability. Feasibility data indicate an intervention spanning several weeks may be difficult to implement in the context of transitional housing. Yet, acceptability of the adapted intervention among participants was consistently high. The findings of this pilot work suggest several implications for informing continued parenting intervention research and practice with homeless families in transitional housing.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A rapid increase of Medicaid expenditures has been a serious concern, and housing stability has been discussed as a means to reduce Medicaid costs. A program evaluation of a New York City supportive housing program has assessed the association between supportive housing tenancy and Medicaid savings among New York City housing program applicants with serious mental illness and chronic homelessness or dual diagnoses of mental illness and substance use disorder, stratified by distinctive Medicaid expenditure patterns., METHODS: The evaluation used matched data from administrative records for 2827 people. Sequence analysis identified 6 Medicaid expenditure patterns during 2 years prior to baseline among people placed in the program (n = 737) and people eligible but not placed (n = 2090), including very low Medicaid coverage, increasing Medicaid expenditure, low, middle, high, and very high Medicaid expenditure patterns. We assessed the impact of the program on Medicaid costs for 2 years post-baseline via propensity score matching and bootstrapping., RESULTS: The housing program was associated with Medicaid savings during 2 years post-baseline (-$9526, 95% CI = -$19,038 to -$2003). Stratified by Medicaid expenditure patterns, Medicaid savings were found among those with very low Medicaid coverage (-$15,694, 95% CI = -$35,926 to -$7983), increasing Medicaid expenditures (-$9020, 95% CI = -$26,753 to -$1705), and high Medicaid expenditure patterns (-$14,450, 95% CI = -$38,232 to -$4454). Savings were largely driven by shorter psychiatric hospitalizations in the post-baseline period among those placed., CONCLUSIONS: The supportive housing program was associated with Medicaid savings, particularly for individuals with very low Medicaid coverage, increasing Medicaid expenditures, and high Medicaid expenditures pre-baseline.

N2  - Research indicates that dispositional attachment security fosters empathy, and that short-term increases in security ("security priming") increase empathy and willingness to help others. In two experiments, we examined effects of recalling one's own vulnerability ( feeling hurt by a relationship partner) and security priming on empathy for a recipient in need. In Study 1, the recipient was a middle-aged homeless woman (low similarity to participants); in Study 2, the recipient was a college-aged woman whose boyfriend had been unfaithful (high similarity to participants). In both studies, hurt feelings influenced participants' empathy, but the nature of the influence varied as a function of target-participant similarity. In Study 1, hurt feelings decreased empathy and increased caregiving avoidance. In Study 2, hurt feelings not only increased empathy but also aroused caregiving anxiety. Furthermore, security priming weakened defensive barriers against helping: In Study 1, it reduced caregiving avoidance, and in Study 2, it reduced caregiving anxiety.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Managed alcohol programs (MAP) aim to reduce harms experienced by unstably housed individuals with alcohol use disorders by providing regulated access to beverage alcohol, usually alongside housing, meals and other supports. This study compares two methods of estimating participants' outside alcohol consumption in order to inform program policies and practices around alcohol dosing and reducing risks of alcohol-related illnesses., METHODS: The total alcohol consumption of 65 people participating in Canadian MAPs was assessed comparing daily MAP records (1903 client days) with researcher-administered surveys over the same time period. A sub-sample of more complete daily MAP records for 39 people (696 client days) was also compared with the equivalent survey data on drinking., RESULTS: Significantly more standard drinks per day (SDs, one SD = 17.05 mL ethanol) were reported in research interviews than recorded by program staff, whether for program administered drinks alone (means 16.04 vs. 8.32 SDs, t = 5.79, P < 0.001) or including outside-program drinks as reported to staff (16.04 vs. 8.89 SDs, t = 5.37, P < 0.001). Consistent results were found in the sub-sample. The number of outside drinks estimated by comparing program records with the research interviews, varied between 2.71 and 9.94 mean drinks per day per site., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: At two sites, MAP participants reported consuming more than twice the amount of alcohol administered on the program. At most sites, there was significant under-reporting of outside drinking. Addressing the problem of outside drinking and total daily consumption is critical for achieving program goals of both short and long-term harm reduction.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Substance use disorder (SUD) and mental health diagnosis negatively affect Veteran homelessness., OBJECTIVE: Assess the acceptance and feasibility of rocking chair therapy as a self-implemented intervention for mood and substance cravings., PICOT: For homeless Veterans in SUD treatment, how does adding vestibular stimulation by use of a rocking chair compared with treatment as usual affect levels of anxiety and substance cravings?, RESULTS: Two significant findings were observed. First, a greater number of minutes spent rocking was associated with significantly greater scores on the Expectancy scale of the Alcohol Craving Questionnaire (ACQ; p = .05), suggesting participants experiencing higher urges and desires to drink rocked to self-soothe. Second, a significant association was observed between a greater number of minutes spent rocking and lower scores on the ACQ Purpose fulness subscale ( p = .03), indicating greater time rocking was associated with fewer urges and desires that are connected with the intent and plan to drink., CONCLUSION: Vestibular stimulation by rocking in a rocking chair may increase the ability to self-regulate mood and substance cravings, thereby potentially reducing risk of relapse and recurrent chronic homelessness.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Cigarette smoking is associated with many adverse health effects and is an important public health concern. Increased understanding of smokers' behavior is central to developing effective interventions. Cigarette scavenging, a behavior that involves smoking shared or previously used cigarettes has thus far only been shown to be prevalent among homeless or incarcerated populations. The current study examines whether cigarette scavenging is prevalent in a more general population of adult smokers enrolling in a smoking cessation clinical trial, and whether engagement in this behavior is associated with demographic or smoking-related psychosocial factors., METHODS: Baseline data was obtained from adult smokers (N=227) enrolling in a randomized clinical trial for smoking cessation. Cigarette scavenging was assessed using three items: a) sharing a cigarette with a stranger; b) smoking a "found" cigarette and c) smoking a previously used cigarette "butt". Participants who endorsed engaging in at least one of these three behaviors were categorized as a scavenger., RESULTS: Approximately 32% of participants endorsed at least one cigarette scavenging behavior. A multiple logistic regression analysis found that scavengers were more likely to be: men (p<0.001), of younger age at smoking onset (p=0.012), unemployed (p=0.003), more likely to have used marijuana in the past 30days (p=0.005), single or living alone (p=0.003), and to have experienced higher withdrawal symptoms during previous quit attempts (p=0.044) as compared to non-scavengers., CONCLUSIONS: Scavenging is common among adult smokers. Interventions that address cigarette scavenging behaviors may better meet the needs of this unique smoking subgroup. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the differences in 14-year outcomes of persons with schizophrenia with and without family history of psychosis in a rural community in China., METHODS: All participants with schizophrenia (n=510) aged 15 years and older were identified in a 1994 epidemiological investigation of 123,572 people and followed up in 2004 and 2008 in Xinjin County, Chengdu, China., RESULTS: Individuals with positive family history of schizophrenia had significantly younger age of first onset than those with negative family history of schizophrenia in 1994 and 2004. Compared with individuals with negative family history of schizophrenia, those with positive family history of schizophrenia had significantly higher rate of homelessness and lower rate of death due to other reasons in 10-year (2004) and 14-year follow-up (2008). There were no significantly differences of mean scores on PANSS, SDSS and GAF in 2008 between positive and negative family history groups., CONCLUSIONS: The positive family history of schizophrenia is strongly related to younger age of onset, and may predict a poorer long-term outcome (e.g., higher rate of homelessness) in persons with schizophrenia in the rural community. The findings have implications for further studies on specific family-related mechanisms on clinical treatment and rehabilitation, as well as for planning and delivering of community-based mental health services.

N2  - Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) are designed to enrich maternal and child diets with the objective of preventing undernutrition during the first 1,000 days. Scaling up the delivery of supplements such as SQ-LNS hinges on understanding private demand and creatively leveraging policy-relevant factors that might influence demand. We used longitudinal stated willingness-to-pay (WTP) data from contingent valuation studies that were integrated into randomized controlled nutrition trials in Ghana and Malawi to estimate private valuation of SQ-LNS during pregnancy, postpartum, and early childhood. We found that average stated WTP for a day's supply of SQ-LNS was more than twice as high in Ghana than Malawi, indicating that demand for SQ-LNS (and by extension, the options for effective delivery of SQ-LNS) may be very context specific. We also examined factors associated with WTP, including intervention group, household socioeconomic status, birth outcomes, child growth, and maternal and child morbidity. In both sites, WTP was consistently negatively associated with household food insecurity, indicating that subsidization might be needed to permit food insecure households to acquire SQ-LNS if it is made available for purchase. In Ghana, WTP was higher among heads of household than among mothers, which may be related to control over household resources. Personal experience using SQ-LNS was not associated with WTP in either site. Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Maternal and Child Nutrition published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Young, black men who have sex with men are disproportionately impacted by the US HIV epidemic, and HIV-positive, young, black men who have sex with men face stark disparities in HIV clinical outcomes., METHODS: We performed an observational analysis of the 199 HIV-positive black men aged 18 to 30 years followed up for 12 months in healthMpowerment, a randomized controlled trial of an Internet-based HIV prevention intervention, to identify time-varying correlates of self-reported viral suppression using relative risk (RR) regression., RESULTS: Retention at the 12-month visit was 84%. One hundred five (65%) of 162 participants reported being undetectable at baseline. At 3, 6, and 12 months, 83 (72%) of 115, 84 (82%) of 103, and 101 (86%) of 117 reported an undetectable viral load, respectively. In a multivariable model, participants who reported homelessness (RR, 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-0.99), who had clinically significant depressive symptoms (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79-0.98), and who used methamphetamine or crack (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38-0.96) were less likely to report an undetectable viral load. Young men who engaged in condomless insertive anal intercourse were more likely to report viral suppression (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04-1.24)., CONCLUSION: HIV care for young, black men who have sex with men must be multidimensional to address medical needs in the context of mental health, substance use, and housing insecurity.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Though disability and housing instability are discussed separately in public health literature, few studies address families at their intersection. As a result, little is known about families who experience both homelessness and disability, how many receive disability benefits like SSI and SSDI, or the influence of those benefits on health-promoting outcomes like housing stability and self-sufficiency. Moreover, no previous research compares the ability of different housing and service interventions to increase disability benefit access., OBJECTIVE: We examine relationships between disabilities and SSI/SSDI income reported when families enter emergency shelters and later health-promoting outcomes (housing stability and self-sufficiency) and how housing interventions affect SSI/SSDI receipt., METHODS: Families in the (name removed) Study (N = 1857) were interviewed in emergency shelters, randomly offered of one of three housing interventions or usual care (i.e., no immediate referral to any intervention beyond shelter), and re-interviewed 20 months later., RESULTS: A third of families reported a disability at shelter entry. SSI/SSDI coverage of these families increased nearly 10% points over 20 months but never exceeded 40%. Disabilities predicted greater housing instability, food insecurity, and economic stress and less work and income. Among families reporting disabilities, SSI/SSDI receipt predicted fewer returns to emergency shelter, and more income despite less work. Offers of long-term housing subsidies increased SSI/SSDI receipt., CONCLUSIONS: Many families experiencing homelessness have disabilities; those receiving SSI/SSDI benefits have better housing and income outcomes. Providing families experiencing homelessness with long-term housing subsidies and SSI/SSDI could improve public health. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - METHODS: A 5-year retrospective chart review was conducted at 3 EDs. Inclusion criteria were patients >=18years old triaged as "mental health - bizarre behavior" (deviation from normal cognitive behaviour with no obvious cause) with a CT head scan ordered in the ED. Exclusion criteria were focal neurologic deficits on exam, alternative medical etiology (i.e. delirium, trauma) and/or pre-existing CNS disease. Clinical, demographic and administrative data were extracted with 10% of charts independently reviewed by an Emergency Physician for inter-rater reliability., RESULTS: 266 cases met study criteria. Population demographics: 49% percent female, average age 51years old, 28% homeless, 58% arrived by police or ambulance. CT head results: 1 (0.4%) case with possible acute findings, 105 (39%) with incidental findings (i.e. cerebral atrophy) that did not impact clinical management. Average time to physician assessment was 1:48 (hour:min) (sd 1:11), time to CT completion was 5:05 (sd 7:28) and an average delay of 3:17 awaiting results. Subgroup analysis revealed a net increase in ED length of stay (ED LOS) of 5:02 from obtaining neuroimaging. 85% of patients were referred to a consultant, 92% were to psychiatry., CONCLUSIONS: CT head results prolonged ED LOS, delayed patient disposition and did not change the patient's clinical management. A prospective trial for ordering CT head scans in these patients is warranted. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Socioeconomic status (SES) is known to have a considerable influence on the development of neuropsychological functions. In particular there is strong evidence for less efficient development of prefrontal-cortex-related functions in children raised in low-SES households. "Street children" are a common feature of low SES in many low- and middle-income countries, and some researchers have suggested that the unique life experiences of street children may drive their neurocognitive development. This study compares a group of 36 former street children in Quito, Ecuador with a control group of 26 never street-connected schoolchildren. All children were assessed with a range of neuropsychological tests. Although the street children group performed significantly below the level of the control group on all measures, they did not demonstrate a generalized lower ability. By controlling the effects of fluid intelligence it was found that there are relatively independent effects on visuospatial ability and executive planning ability. Furthermore, the executive function test scores in general are significantly less affected than the other cognitive functions and may be temporary effects caused by recent substance abuse within the street child sample. The findings generally support results from other countries suggesting that low SES is associated with negative effects on neuropsychological development. However, they also suggest that the local social and economic context, such as in the case of street children, might mitigate the harmful effects of low SES on the development of some executive functions.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study compares the effect of Housing First on older (>=50 years old) and younger (18-49 years old) homeless adults with mental illness participating in At Home/Chez Soi, a 24-month multisite randomized controlled trial of Housing First., METHOD: At Home/Chez Soi, participants (n = 2148) were randomized to receive rent supplements with intensive case management or assertive community treatment, based on their need level for mental health services, or usual care in their respective communities. A subgroup analysis compared older (n = 470) and younger (n = 1678) homeless participants across baseline characteristics and 24-month outcomes including housing stability (primary outcome), generic and condition-specific quality of life, community functioning, physical and mental health status, mental health symptom severity, psychological community integration, recovery, and substance use (secondary outcomes)., RESULTS: At 24 months, Housing First significantly improved the percentage of days stably housed among older (+43.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 38.4% to 49.5%) and younger homeless adults (+39.7%, 95% CI: 36.8% to 42.6%), compared with usual care, with no significant differences between age groups (difference of differences = +4.2%, 95% CI: -2.1% to 10.5%, p = 0.188). Improvements from baseline to 24 months in mental health and condition-specific quality of life were significantly greater among older homeless adults than among younger homeless adults., CONCLUSION: Housing First significantly improved housing stability among older and younger homeless adults with mental illness, resulting in superior mental health and quality of life outcomes in older homeless adults compared with younger homeless adults at 24 months.

N2  - The Dissociative Symptoms Scale (DSS) was developed to assess moderately severe levels of depersonalization, derealization, gaps in awareness or memory, and dissociative reexperiencing that would be relevant to a wide range of clinical populations. Structural analyses of data from four clinical and five nonclinical samples ( N = 1,600) yielded four factors that reflected the domains of interest and showed good fit with the data. Sample scores were consistent with expectations and showed very good internal consistency and temporal stability. Analyses showed consistent evidence of convergent and divergent validity, and posttrauma elevations in scores and in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder provided additional evidence of construct validity. Item response theory analyses indicated that the items assessed moderately severe dissociative experiences. Overall, the results provide support for the reliability and validity of DSS total and subscale scores in the populations studied. Further work is needed to evaluate the performance of the DSS relative to structured interview measures and in samples of patients with other psychological disorders.

N2  - Homeless youth frequently experience victimization, and youth with histories of trauma often fail to detect danger risks, making them vulnerable to subsequent victimization. The current study describes a pilot test of a skills-based intervention designed to improve risk detection among homeless youth through focusing attention to internal, interpersonal, and environmental cues. Youth aged 18 to 21 years ( N = 74) were recruited from a shelter and randomly assigned to receive usual case management services or usual services plus a 3-day manualized risk detection intervention. Pretest and posttest interviews assessed youths' risk detection abilities through vignettes describing risky situations and asking youth to identify risk cues present. Separate 2 (intervention vs. control) x 2 (pretest vs. posttest) mixed ANOVAs found significant interaction effects, as intervention youth significantly improved in overall risk detection compared with control youth. Post hoc subgroup analyses found the intervention had a greater effect for youth without previous experiences of indirect victimization than those with previous indirect victimization experiences.

N2  - AIM: Immigration is a risk factor for psychosis emergence, and previous studies show that immigrants are less likely to engage in treatment for psychosis. However, the literature on outcome is scant and heterogeneous. This study was designed to compare first-generation (FGI) and second-generation immigrants (SGI) to non-immigrants' symptomatic and functional outcomes 2 years after a first-episode psychosis (FEP)., METHODS: A 2-year prospective longitudinal study of 223 FEP patients between 18 and 30 years took place in two early intervention services (EIS) in Montreal, Canada., RESULTS: Forty-two per cent of the sample were immigrants (FGI (n = 56), SGI (n = 38)). Compared with non-immigrants, immigrants had similar symptomatic and functioning profiles at baseline, 1 and 2 years, except that fewer SGI had a history of homelessness and more were living with their families. FGI were less likely to have a substance use disorder but more likely to pursue their studies and to present depressive symptoms., CONCLUSIONS: Even if immigrants are known to be at greater risk of developing psychosis, probably secondary to stress related to immigration, their symptomatic and functional outcomes, once engaged in EIS treatment, are similar to or sometimes better than non-immigrants' outcomes. Because immigrants tend to be less engaged in their follow-up, understanding why they disengage from treatment is crucial to develop better therapeutic approaches to better engage them as EIS treatment can improve their outcomes effectively.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although the initiation of injection drug use has been well characterized among at-risk youth, factors that support or impede cessation of injection drug use have received less attention. We sought to identify socioeconomic factors associated with cessation of injection drug use among street-involved youth., METHODS: From September 2005 to May 2015, data were collected from the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), a prospective cohort study of street-involved youth in Vancouver, Canada. Multivariate extended Cox regression was utilized to identify socioeconomic factors associated with cessation of injection drug use for six months or longer among youth who were actively injecting., RESULTS: Among 383 participants, 171 (44.6%) youth reported having ceased injection (crude incidence density 22 per 100 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 19-26) at some point during study follow-up. Youth who had recently dealt drugs (adjusted hazard ration [AHR], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.29-0.87), engaged in prohibited street-based income generation (AHR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.24-0.69), and engaged in illegal income generating activities (AHR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06-0.61) were significantly less likely to report cessation of injection drug use., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that socioeconomic factors, in particular engagement in prohibited street-based and illegal income generating activities, may pose barriers to ceasing injection drug use among this population. Effort to improve access to stable and secure income, as well as employment opportunities may assist youth in transitioning away from injection drug use., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Our study is not a randomized controlled trial; thus the trial registration is not applicable.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Opioid substitution therapy and needle exchanges have reduced blood-borne viruses (BBVs) among people who inject drugs (PWID). Some PWID continue to share injecting equipment., OBJECTIVES: To develop an evidence-based psychosocial intervention to reduce BBV risk behaviours and increase transmission knowledge among PWID, and conduct a feasibility trial among PWID comparing the intervention with a control., DESIGN: A pragmatic, two-armed randomised controlled, open feasibility trial. Service users were Steering Group members and co-developed the intervention. Peer educators co-delivered the intervention in London., SETTING: NHS or third-sector drug treatment or needle exchanges in Glasgow, London, Wrexham and York, recruiting January and February 2016., PARTICIPANTS: Current PWID, aged >= 18 years., INTERVENTIONS: A remote, web-based computer randomisation system allocated participants to a three-session, manualised, psychosocial, gender-specific group intervention delivered by trained facilitators and BBV transmission information booklet plus treatment as usual (TAU) (intervention), or information booklet plus TAU (control)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recruitment, retention and follow-up rates measured feasibility. Feedback questionnaires, focus groups with participants who attended at least one intervention session and facilitators assessed the intervention's acceptability., RESULTS: A systematic review of what works to reduce BBV risk behaviours among PWID; in-depth interviews with PWID; and stakeholder and expert consultation informed the intervention. Sessions covered improving injecting technique and good vein care; planning for risky situations; and understanding BBV transmission. Fifty-six per cent (99/176) of eligible PWID were randomised: 52 to the intervention group and 47 to the control group. Only 24% (8/34) of male and 11% (2/18) of female participants attended all three intervention sessions. Overall, 50% (17/34) of men and 33% (6/18) of women randomised to the intervention group and 47% (14/30) of men and 53% (9/17) of women randomised to the control group were followed up 1 month post intervention. Variations were reported by location. The intervention was acceptable to both participants and facilitators. At 1 month post intervention, no increase in injecting in 'risky' sites (e.g. groin, neck) was reported by participants who attended at least one session. PWID who attended at least one session showed a trend towards greater reduction in injecting risk behaviours, a greater increase in withdrawal planning and were more confident about finding a vein. A mean cost of 58.17 per participant was calculated for those attending one session, 148.54 for those attending two sessions and 270.67 for those attending all three sessions, compared with 0.86 in the control group. Treatment costs across the centres vary as a result of the different levels of attendance, as total session costs are divided by attendees to obtain a cost per attendee. The economic analysis suggests that a cost-effectiveness study would be feasible given the response rates and completeness of data. However, we have identified aspects where the service use questionnaire could be abbreviated given the low numbers reported in several care domains. No adverse events were reported., CONCLUSIONS: As only 19% of participants attended all three intervention sessions and 47% were followed up 1 month post intervention, a future definitive randomised controlled trial of the intervention is not feasible. Exposure to information on improving injecting techniques did not encourage riskier injecting practices or injecting frequency, and benefits were reported among attendees. The intervention has the potential to positively influence BBV prevention. Harm reduction services should ensure that the intervention content is routinely delivered to PWID to improve vein care and prevent BBVs., FUTURE WORK: The intervention did not meet the complex needs of some PWID, more tailoring may be needed to reach PWID who are more frequent injectors, who are homeless and female., LIMITATIONS: Intervention delivery proved more feasible in London than other locations. Non-attendance at the York trial site substantially influenced the results., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN66453696 and PROSPERO 014:CRD42014012969., FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 21, No. 72.

N2  - The aim of this mixed-methods study was to investigate attrition at the age 10-year follow-up in a study of vulnerable children and their families living with low income following a two-generation preschool program in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Quantitative factors associated with attrition included: (a) food bank use; (b) unstable housing; (c) child welfare involvement; (d) unpartnered status; and (e) caregiver noncompletion of high school. Qualitative themes related to attrition included: (a) income and employment; (b) health; (c) unstable housing; (d) change of guardianship; (e) domestic violence; (f) work and time management challenges; and (g) negative caregiver-child relationships. Triangulation of quantitative and qualitative results occurred using Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs; families with unmet physiological, safety, belongingness and love needs, and esteem needs were more likely to attrite. Attrition in longitudinal studies with vulnerable families is complex, affected by frequently changing life circumstances, and struggles to access necessities of life. Strategies for retaining vulnerable families in longitudinal research are offered.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Homeless female ex-offenders (homeless female offenders) exiting jail and prison are at a critical juncture during reentry and transitioning into the community setting., OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to compare the effect of a dialectical behavioral therapy-case management (DBT-CM) program with a health promotion (HP) program on achieving drug and alcohol abstinence among female parolees/probationers residing in the community., METHODS: We conducted a multicenter parallel randomized controlled trial with 130 female parolees/probationers (aged 19-64 years) residing in the community randomly assigned to either DBT-CM (n = 65) or HP (n = 65). The trial was conducted in four community-based partner sites in Los Angeles and Pomona, California, from February 2015 to November 2016. Treatment assignment was carried out using a computer-based urn randomization program. The primary outcome was drug and alcohol use abstinence at 6-month follow up., RESULTS: Analysis was based on data from 116 participants with complete outcome data. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that the DBT-CM program remained an independent positive predictor of decrease in drug use among the DBT-CM participants at 6 months (p = .01) as compared with the HP program participants. Being non-White (p < .05) and having higher depressive symptom scores (p < .05) were associated with lower odds of drug use abstinence (i.e., increased the odds of drug use) at 6 months., DISCUSSION: DBT-CM increased drug and alcohol abstinence at 6-month follow-up, compared to an HP program.

N2  - Among people experiencing homelessness, difficulty securing housing is often compounded by concurrent challenges including unemployment, chronic illness, criminal justice involvement, and victimization. The Moving Ahead Program (MAP) is a vocational rehabilitation program that seeks to help adults facing these challenges to secure competitive employment. We prospectively studied how MAP graduates (N = 97) changed from the beginning of MAP to about six months after graduation. We observed a variety of positive outcomes not just in employment and housing but also in health, substance use, and criminal justice involvement. However, these gains were not universal; for instance, participants were less likely to report positive outcomes at follow-up if they started MAP with a serious mental illness, made relatively small gains in work skills, or did not seek mental health treatment during the six months after they completed MAP. These findings might encourage program staff to devote additional resources toward supporting at-risk students.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Stunting affects close to 2.4 million children in Uganda, and it is among the major contributors to the annual loss in productivity of the equivalent of US$899 million., OBJECTIVE: This study sought to identify the key underlying causes of the persistently high stunting rates in a region of Uganda known to have low poverty rates and a high agricultural output., METHODS: A matched case-control study was conducted in Buhweju district, southwest Uganda to compare prior exposures between stunted children (cases) and nonstunted children (controls)., RESULTS: The sample comprised 56 cases and 112 controls, totaling 168 children aged 6 to 59 months. There were almost equal numbers of boys and girls in the sample. Boys were significantly more likely to be stunted compared to girls (odds ratio [OR]: 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-4.2; P < .05). Stunted children were significantly less likely to be introduced to complementary foods at an appropriate age and their primary caregivers lacked knowledge about stunting. The odds of stunting were 2.4 times greater for children in food-insecure households compared to those in food-secure households (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1-5.0; P < .05) and 4.5 times greater among children who resided in poor quality houses (OR: 4.5, 95% CI: 1.4-13.0; P < .05)., CONCLUSION: Low access to appropriate complementary diets, sex of child, food insecurity, poor socioeconomic status, and low knowledge about stunting were the main predictors of childhood stunting in the study population.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The phenomenon of street children in Egypt constitutes a public health concern. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of institutionalised street children in Alexandria, to compare the prevalence of substance abuse and conduct disorder between street children and school children, and to identify predictors of these mental health outcomes among street children., METHODS: Institutionalised street children (n = 102) participated in a cross-sectional comparative study with a matched group of school children (n = 156). An interviewing questionnaire was used to assess demographic characteristics and substance use. Conduct disorder was measured using the Revised Ontario Child Health study scale., RESULTS: Poverty, family breakdown, and domestic violence were the main reasons for street children having left home. Street children recorded significantly higher rates of substance use (9.8%) and conduct disorder (35.3%) compared to school children. In street children, smoking was a significant predictor of substance use and conduct disorder. Other predictors of conduct disorder included physical illness and having 5 to 7 siblings., CONCLUSION: Substance abuse and conduct disorder were present among institutionalised street children at higher rates than school children. Absence of basic life needs and disrupted families constituted the main reasons for leaving home. Interventions at the governmental and non-governmental levels are needed.

N2  - PROBLEM: Street-involved youth experience many barriers to accessing health and social services. There is a literature gap in the literature regarding evidence-based interventions to facilitate engagement with street-involved youth., METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study of preliminary findings from a large mixed-methods study was undertaken to assess the impact of a resilience-based motivational intervention. This intervention was grounded in frameworks including strengths-based and resilience-based communication using the Seven C's Model of Resilience, positive youth development, and motivational interviewing that are particularly relevant to youth. Individual interviews were conducted with two subsets of youth who participated (n = 3) or did not participate (n = 3) in the intervention. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify themes between the intervention and comparison groups., FINDINGS: Preliminary themes identified across the sample include (1) establishing a trusting relationship, (2) strengthening self-worth and resilience, (3) focusing on goals, and (4) perceiving a sense of hope and possibility., CONCLUSIONS: The themes identified the importance of positive relationships with care providers built upon a foundation of trust to engage youth to remain motivated and focused on their goals.

N2  - Cognitive impairments are common in homeless youth and negatively impact academic and vocational outcomes. We examined the feasibility and efficacy of cognitive interventions provided to 18- to 22-year-old homeless youth living in urban supportive housing. Ninety-one homeless youth were randomized to receive either targeted cognitive training (cognitive remediation) or general cognitive activation (computer skills training). Cognitive and psychological outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 13 and 26 sessions, and 1 month postintervention. A high dropout rate highlighted the feasibility challenges of treating this population. Intent-to-treat analysis found significant improvements across groups in specific and global measures of cognition and psychological distress, with no significant group differences. Transition-age homeless youth show improvements in cognitive and psychological functioning when engaged in interventions that address their cognitive development. This speaks to the malleability of cognitive skills in this cohort and lays the groundwork for future research to address their cognitive health.

N2  - Some criminal defendants with mental illness may not be referred to traditional mental health jail diversion programs because they have a history of non-compliance with treatment, or complex personal circumstances such as homelessness. To successfully divert such individuals, Connecticut has developed a specialized program called the Advanced Supervision and Intervention Support Team (ASIST), which offers criminal justice supervision in conjunction with mental health treatment and support services. An evaluation of the ASIST program included a six-month follow-up study of 111 program clients to examine mental health functioning and other outcomes, and a comparison of administrative data for 492 ASIST clients with a propensity-matched group to examine recidivism. Follow-up study clients showed improvements in mental health. Administrative data showed no change in arrest rates, but a significant reduction in re-incarceration. These findings must be viewed with caution due to the quasi-experimental design of the study, but it appears that greater attention to criminogenic needs in addition to defendants' mental illness may help jurisdictions to divert a wider variety of defendants.

N2  - BACKGROUND: People who inject drugs (PWID) frequently engage in injection risk behaviours exposing them to blood-borne infections. Understanding the underlying causes that drive various types and levels of risk behaviours is important to better target preventive interventions., METHODS: A total of 2150 PWID in Swedish remand prisons were interviewed between 2002 and 2012. Questions on socio-demographic and drug-related variables were asked in relation to the following outcomes: Having shared injection drug solution and having lent out or having received already used drug injection equipment within a 12 month recall period., RESULTS: Women shared solutions more than men (odds ratio (OR) 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03; 2.21). Those who had begun to inject drugs before age 17 had a higher risk (OR 1.43, 95% CI 0.99; 2.08) of having received used equipment compared to 17-19 year olds. Amphetamine-injectors shared solutions more than those injecting heroin (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.64; 3.62). A housing contract lowered the risk of unsafe injection by 37-59% compared to being homeless., CONCLUSIONS: Women, early drug debut, amphetamine users and homeless people had a significantly higher level of injection risk behaviour and need special attention and tailored prevention to successfully combat hepatitis C and HIV transmission among PWID., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier, NCT02234167.

N2  - Despite its increasing popularity, little is known about the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model in primary care settings serving homeless populations. Our objective was to understand how patient experience differs between a PCMH demonstration practice designed for homeless people in Massachusetts and other practices participating in the same statewide initiative. The study population included 194 homeless patients and 1,868 patients from comparison practices. Patient experience was compared on key measures of patient-centeredness, while applying case-mix adjustment to control for sociodemographic and clinical factors. The practice for homeless patients scored higher than the comparison group on self-management support and behavioral health integration, while being equivalent on three other measures. Potential areas for improvement include measures related to communication, front desk staff, and timely appointments. We discuss possible explanations for the observed pattern of results in the context of the unique challenges faced by a practice designed to serve individuals experiencing homelessness.

Y1  - 2017//

N2  - A longitudinal randomized controlled trial tested whether access to permanent housing reduces child maltreatment among inadequately housed families under investigation for child abuse and neglect. The study followed homeless and child welfare-involved families randomly assigned to receive a referral for housing subsidies plus housing case management (n = 75, 196 children) or housing case management alone (n = 75, 186 children). Latent growth models examined change in caregiver-reported frequencies of psychological aggression, physical abuse, and neglect toward children at five time points across 2.5 years. Intent-to-treat analyses suggested treatment differences for minor assault and neglect that approached significance; families randomly assigned to permanent housing plus case management exhibited marginally greater declines compared to families referred for housing case management only. Caregiver psychological aggression remained high over time, regardless of treatment condition. No evidence indicated higher risk families benefitted more from permanent housing. Results show some promise of permanent housing and highlight the complex needs of homeless families under investigation for child maltreatment. Findings emphasize the importance of continued involvement from the child welfare system to connect families with important resources. Copyright © Society for Community Research and Action 2017.

This study is a secondary analysis of data collected in a randomized clinical trial of AWARE, a new 4 session group motivational interviewing intervention. AWARE mainly focused on alcohol use and sexual risk behavior given focus group feedback. We used sequential coding to analyze how the group process affected both AOD use and sexual risk behavior at 3-month follow up among homeless young adults by examining facilitator behavior and participant change talk (CT) and sustain talk (ST). We analyzed 57 group session digital recordings of 100 youth (69% male, 74% heterosexual, 28% non-Hispanic white, 23% African American, 26% Hispanic, 23% multiracial/other; mean age 21.75). Outcomes included importance and readiness to change AOD use and risky sexual behavior, AOD use and consequences, number of partners and unprotected sex, and condom self-efficacy. Sequential analysis indicated that facilitator open-ended questions and reflections of CT increased Group CT. Group CT was associated with a lower likelihood of being a heavy drinker 3 months later; Group ST was associated with decreased readiness and confidence to change alcohol use. There were no associations with CT or ST for drug use or risky sexual behavior. Facilitator speech and peer responses were related to CT and ST during the group sessions with this high risk population, which were then associated with individual changes for alcohol use. Further research is needed to explore associations with drug use and sexual risk behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record Copyright (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved).

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Tobacco remains the key modifiable risk factor for the development of a number of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tuberculosis and cancer. Among priority populations, smoking prevalence remains high, smokers tend to relapse more often and earlier and fewer are able to sustain quit attempts. This systematic review provides an update on the literature. Areas covered: Twenty-four randomized controlled trials published from 2010-2017, in English language, were identified after searching on Medline, Ovid, Embase and PsycINFO databases. Studies reported on the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions among six disadvantaged groups known to have high smoking rates: (i) homeless, (ii) prisoners, (iii) indigenous populations, (iv) at-risk youth, (v) people with low income, and (vi) those with a mental illness. Narrative review and assessment of methodological quality of included papers was undertaken. Expert commentary: There is a growing evidence base of methodologically robust studies evaluating a variety of behavioural smoking cessation interventions for priority populations. Multi-component interventions and those examining behavioural interventions incorporating mindfulness training, financial incentives, motivational interviewing and extended telephone-delivered counseling may be effective in the short-term, particularly for smokers on low incomes and people with a mental illness.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC are geographically proximate cities with high HIV prevalence, including among black men who have sex with men (BMSM). Using data collected among BMSM in CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance project, we compared socio-demographic characteristics, HIV risk behaviors, and service utilization to explore similarities and differences that could inform local and regional HIV intervention approaches., METHODS: BMSM were recruited through venue time location sampling, June-December, 2011. Participants completed identical socio-behavioral surveys and voluntary HIV testing. Analyses were conducted among the full sample and those aged 18-24., FINDINGS: Participants included 159 (DC), 364 (Baltimore), and 331 (Philadelphia) eligible BMSM. HIV prevalence was 23.1% (DC), 48.0% (Baltimore), 14.6% (Philadelphia) with 30.6%, 69.0%, 33.3% unrecognized HIV infection, respectively. Among BMSM 18-24, HIV prevalence was 11.1% (DC), 38.9% (Baltimore), 9.6% (Philadelphia) with unrecognized HIV infection 0.0%, 73.8%, 60.0% respectively. Compared with the other 2 cities, Baltimore participants were less likely to identify as gay/homosexual; more likely to report unemployment, incarceration, homelessness, sex exchange; and least likely to use the internet for partners. DC participants were more likely to have a college degree and employment. Philadelphia participants were more likely to report gay/homosexual identity, receptive condomless anal sex, having only main partners, and bars/clubs as partner meeting places. Sexually transmitted disease testing was universally low., CONCLUSIONS: Analyses showed especially high HIV prevalence among BMSM in Baltimore including among young BMSM. Socio-demographic characteristics and HIV infection correlates differed across cities but unrecognized HIV infection and unknown partner status were universally high.

N2  - Background: Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that the newest latent tuberculosis (LTBI) regimen, 12 weekly doses of directly observed isoniazid and rifapentine (3HP), is as efficacious as 9 months of isoniazid, with a greater completion rate (82% vs 69%); however, 3HP has not been assessed in routine healthcare settings., Methods: Observational cohort of LTBI patients receiving 3HP through 16 US programs was used to assess treatment completion, adverse drug reactions, and factors associated with treatment discontinuation., Results: Of 3288 patients eligible to complete 3HP, 2867 (87.2%) completed treatment. Children aged 2-17 years had the highest completion rate (94.5% [155/164]). Patients reporting homelessness had a completion rate of 81.2% (147/181). In univariable analyses, discontinuation was lowest among children (relative risk [RR], 0.44 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .23-.85]; P = .014), and highest in persons aged >=65 years (RR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.25-2.35]; P < .001). In multivariable analyses, discontinuation was lowest among contacts of patients with tuberculosis (TB) disease (adjusted RR [ARR], 0.68 [95% CI, .52-.89]; P = .005) and students (ARR, 0.45 [95% CI, .21-.98]; P = .044), and highest with incarceration (ARR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.08-1.89]; P = .013) and homelessness (ARR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.25-2.39]; P = .001). Adverse drug reactions were reported by 1174 (35.7%) patients, of whom 891 (76.0%) completed treatment., Conclusions: Completion of 3HP in routine healthcare settings was greater overall than rates reported from clinical trials, and greater than historically observed using other regimens among reportedly nonadherent populations. Widespread use of 3HP for LTBI treatment could accelerate elimination of TB disease in the United States.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Individuals experiencing homelessness are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity. The At Home/Chez Soi study provides a unique opportunity to first examine baseline levels of food security among homeless individuals with mental illness and second to evaluate the effect of a Housing First (HF) intervention on food security in this population., DESIGN: At Home/Chez Soi was a 2-year randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of HF compared with usual care among homeless adults with mental illness, stratified by level of need for mental health services (high or moderate). Logistic regressions tested baseline associations between food security (US Food Security Survey Module), study site, sociodemographic variables, duration of homelessness, alcohol/substance use, physical health and service utilization. Negative binomial regression determined the impact of the HF intervention on achieving levels of high or marginal food security over an 18-month follow-up period (6 to 24 months)., SETTING: Community settings at five Canadian sites (Moncton, Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver)., SUBJECTS: Homeless adults with mental illness (n 2148)., RESULTS: Approximately 41 % of our sample reported high or marginal food security at baseline, but this figure varied with gender, age, mental health issues and substance use problems. High need participants who received HF were more likely to achieve marginal or high food security than those receiving usual care, but only at the Toronto and Moncton sites., CONCLUSIONS: Our large multi-site study demonstrated low levels of food security among homeless experiencing mental illness. HF showed promise for improving food security among participants with high levels of need for mental health services, with notable site differences.

N2  - Permanent supportive housing (PSH) is an evidence-based health intervention for persons experiencing homelessness, but the impact of individual mechanisms within this intervention on health requires further research. This study examines the longitudinal impact of the mechanism of supportive housing within a peer-delivered PSH model on overall health and mental health (as measured by psychological distress and self-report of bothersome symptoms) outcomes in an ethnically diverse population. The 237 participants in the study included persons who were homeless or at risk of homelessness and who also had been diagnosed with a serious mental illness. Sixty-one percent of all participants received supportive housing. All 3 outcomes were significantly associated with quality of life indicators, recovery, and social connectedness. In addition, overall health was significantly associated with employment, age, and psychological distress. Psychological distress was associated with gender, type of housing, and history of violence or trauma. Experiencing bothersome symptoms was associated with drug use, history of violence or trauma, and psychological distress. Longitudinal models of these 3 outcomes showed that supportive housing was significantly associated with good to excellent health 6 months after baseline (odds ratio = 3.11, 95% confidence interval [1.12, 8.66]). The models also demonstrated that the supportive housing and comparison groups experienced decreased psychological distress after baseline. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of supportive housing within the context of PSH, particularly for the overall health of participants, and the positive overall impact of PSH on mental health in a diverse population.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The current study sought to test hard drug use outcomes for youth receiving a strengths-based outreach and advocacy intervention that linked youth to either a shelter or a drop-in center., METHODS: Homeless youth (14-24 years old) were engaged by research assistants (RAs) at soup kitchens, parks, libraries, and other locations that homeless youth were known to frequent. Youth were randomly assigned to receive six months of advocacy that focused on linking youth to a drop-in center (n = 40) or to a crisis shelter (n = 39). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Hard drug use over time was the main outcome. Intervention condition and service connection were used as predictors for the baseline level and the slope of change in hard drug use over time. Data analysis was conducted with Bernoulli Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling in HLM7., RESULTS: The current study found that those who were in the drop-in linkage condition exhibited a greater reduction in their odds of using hard drugs during the follow-up points than their counterparts in the shelter linkage condition. And finally, those who utilized services more often during the follow-ups were those who exhibited less hard drug use at baseline and less reduction in their odds of using hard drugs., CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that drop-in centers, which are often characterized by low-demand programming and few behavioral restrictions, are effective for addressing hard drug use among homeless youth.

N2  - Research focused on the relationship between place and health demonstrates that it is complex and shifting, as overlapping social, historical, institutional and political and economic processes continually transform the landscapes in which lived experiences are embedded. Understanding this relationship requires knowledge of the situated meanings and local worlds that ethnographic methods are well suited to investigate. However, even conventional ethnographic methods can be inadequate to capture the embodied, lived experience of place - experiences in which the sensory and inner processes of memory and imagination are often privileged. Accessing these experiences and processes can require more experimental methodological approaches. In this article, I present work from a series of photo essays created between 2011 and 2016 by 15 young people who inhabit the social, spatial and economic margins of Vancouver, Canada, and discuss some of the challenges and opportunities presented by this methodology. Created over 5 years, and broadly focused on how they understood, experienced and navigated their 'place' in the city in the midst of poverty, addiction, violence and physical and mental health crises, the photo essays young people produced are embedded with personal biographies and trajectories, as well as shared experiences of geography, precarity and possibility in Vancouver.

N2  - Children living in households that have recently become food insecure may be particularly vulnerable to adverse weight and dietary changes, but longitudinal studies examining these associations are lacking. Using data from 501 Head Start preschoolers from Michigan (48% male) who were followed during one school year as a part of a randomized obesity prevention trial, we examined changes in children's adiposity indices and dietary quality according to changes in household food insecurity. Household food insecurity change status was categorized as persistently food secure, became food secure, persistently food insecure, or became food insecure. Linear mixed effects models were used to estimate relative changes in BMI-for-age z scores (BAZ), triceps skinfolds-for-age z scores (TAZ), or diet quality (assessed with the 2010 Healthy Eating Index) over the school year according to food insecurity category. We found that girls from households that became food insecure over the year had a 0.21 unit higher gain in BAZ than girls from households that were persistently food secure, after adjustment for potential confounders (95% CI 0.02 to 0.39, P = 0.03). Girls from households that became food secure had improvements in dietary quality over the year compared to girls from persistently food insecure households (adjusted difference in Healthy Eating Index score change = 9.1 points; 95% CI 3.0 to 15.0; p = 0.003). There were no statistically significant associations with changes in TAZ. Among boys, there were no associations between changes in household food insecurity and changes in BAZ, TAZ, or dietary quality. In summary, we found that BMI and diet quality changes of Head Start preschool girls were correlated with short-term changes in household food insecurity. Continued research efforts should focus on identifying the most effective ways to promote the health of children in food insecure households, especially those who may have recently transitioned or are transitioning into food insecurity.

N2  - Background The number of welfare recipients has steadily increased in Japan during recent years, although the number of homeless persons has decreased. Despite there being many reports regarding medicolegal death among homeless persons, medicolegal death among welfare recipients has not been fully investigated. Methods We identified 10,293 individuals who received welfare aid during their lifetime among the 81,867 cases that were examined by the Tokyo Medical Examiner's Office (2008-2013). We retrospectively compared the proportions of medicolegal death to total population, age, sex, family status, clinical history, and manners/causes of death among non-indigent persons (controls), homeless persons, and welfare recipients. Results A higher proportion of medicolegal death to total population was observed among the welfare recipients, compared with the controls. The welfare recipients (65.5 years) were younger than the controls (68.9 years), and the proportions of male sex and living alone were higher among the welfare recipients. Hypertension and circulatory disease were the leading clinical conditions among the welfare recipients. Death due to disease was the leading manner of death, and circulatory disease was the leading cause of death among the welfare recipients. The proportion of individuals with a long period between death and discovery (which made determining the cause of death difficult) was also higher among the welfare recipients. Conclusion Welfare recipients have a greater risk of sudden death compared with non-indigent persons. Preventive strategies should target middle-aged to elderly men who live alone, and should address their risks of circulatory diseases and solitary death.

N2  - Homeless young adults ages 18-25 exhibit high rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use, and sexual risk behaviors such as unprotected sex. Yet few programs exist for this population that are both effective and can be easily incorporated into settings serving this population. This pilot cluster cross-over randomized controlled trial evaluates AWARE, a voluntary four session group-based motivational interviewing (MI) intervention to reduce AOD use and sexual risk behavior. We evaluated AWARE with 200 homeless young adults using drop-in center services in Los Angeles County (mean age=21.8years; 73% male; 79% heterosexual; 31% non-Hispanic White, 25% African American, 24% Hispanic, 21% multiracial/other). Surveys were completed at baseline and three months after program completion. Retention in the AWARE program was excellent (79% attended multiple sessions) and participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the program. AWARE participants self-reported positive change in their past 3month and past 30day alcohol use (ps<=0.05), motivation to change drug use (ps<0.05), and condom use self-efficacy (p=0.05) compared to the control group. Among those with multiple sex partners, AWARE participants showed a decrease in unprotected sexual events (p<0.05), whereas the control group did not. Results from this pilot evaluation are promising, suggesting that a brief group-MI risk reduction intervention can be effective in helping homeless young adults make positive changes in their alcohol and condom use. Further work is needed to more fully evaluate the efficacy of AWARE on AOD behavior and sexual risk behavior outcomes. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - The Impact of Family Unification Housing Vouchers on Child Welfare Outcomes.

N2  - This study addresses whether providing housing vouchers through the Family Unification Program (FUP) to families involved in the child welfare system reduces child maltreatment and the need for child welfare services. The study uses child welfare administrative data on 326 children in Portland, Oregon, and 502 children in San Diego, California from the point at which their families were referred to the program through 18 months post-referral. Using a quasi-experimental waitlist comparison design, probit regressions show little impact of FUP on preventing child removal from home, but some positive impact on reunification among children already placed out of home. Hazard estimations show receipt of FUP speeds up child welfare case closure. Impacts on new reports of abuse and neglect are mixed, but point toward reduced reports. Low rates of removal among intact comparison families and high rates of reunification for children in out-of-home care suggest poor targeting of housing resources. Housing vouchers are being given to families not bearing the risks the program is intended to address. The presence of some positive findings suggests that housing vouchers might help reduce child welfare involvement if better targeting were practiced by child welfare agencies.

N2  - PURPOSE: Prior studies showed that food insecurity may increase the odds of obesity in children and adults. We still know very little about the familial aggregation of obesity in food-insecure households or the mechanisms by which food insecurity confers an increased risk of obesity to children. The purpose of this study was to compare children and mothers from food-insecure and food-secure households in their weight status, child eating patterns/behaviors, and maternal feeding practices., DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty mothers of 8-10-year-old children were asked to complete questionnaires, including the U.S. Household Food Security survey, and had their own and their children's heights and weights measured., RESULTS: The odds of a child being obese were five times higher for children from food-insecure households compared with children from food-secure households (95% confidence interval 1.15-20.8). In univariate analyses, children from food-insecure households showed significantly greater external eating, both past satiation and in the absence of hunger (p < .03), and mothers from food-insecure households expressed significantly greater concern about their children's weight and used restrictive feeding practices to a greater extent (p < .03) when compared with families from food-secure households. A greater proportion of children from food-secure households consumed three to four snacks per day (45.9 vs. 15.4%), while a higher proportion of children from food-insecure households consumed five or more snacks per day (15.4 vs. 0%; p = .02)., PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: These findings provide further support for an association between food insecurity and childhood obesity and suggest that differences in external eating, child snacking patterns, and select maternal feeding practices may be implicated in food-insecure children's overconsumption of calories. When caring for food-insecure children, healthcare providers should screen for problematic eating patterns and feeding practices. Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: While opiate substitution therapy and injecting equipment provision (IEP) have reduced blood-borne viruses (BBV) among people who inject drugs (PWID), some PWID continue to share injecting equipment and acquire BBV. Psychosocial interventions that address risk behaviours could reduce BBV transmission among PWID., METHODS: A pragmatic, two-armed randomised controlled, open feasibility study of PWID attending drug treatment or IEP in four UK regions. Ninety-nine PWID were randomly allocated to receive a three-session manualised psychosocial group intervention and BBV transmission information booklet plus treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 52) or information booklet plus TAU (n = 47). The intervention was developed from evidence-based literature, qualitative interviews with PWID, key stakeholder consultations, and expert opinion. Recruitment rates, retention in treatment, follow-up completion rates and health economic data completion measured feasibility., RESULTS: Fifty-six percent (99/176) of eligible PWID were recruited. More participants attended at least one intervention session in London (10/16; 63%) and North Wales (7/13; 54%) than in Glasgow (3/12; 25%) and York (0/11). Participants who attended no sessions (n = 32) compared to those attending at least one (n = 20) session were more likely to be homeless (56 vs 25%, p = 0.044), injected drugs for a greater number of days (median 25 vs 6.5, p = 0.019) and used a greater number of needles from an IEP in the last month (median 31 vs 20, p = 0.056). No adverse events were reported. 45.5% (45/99) were followed up 1 month post-intervention. Feedback forms confirmed that the intervention was acceptable to both intervention facilitators and participants who attended it. Follow-up attendance was associated with fewer days of injecting in the last month (median 14 vs 27, p = 0.030) and fewer injections of cocaine (13 vs 30%, p = 0.063). Analysis of the questionnaires identified several service use questionnaire categories that could be excluded from the assessment battery in a full-randomised controlled trial., CONCLUSIONS: Findings should be interpreted with caution due to small sample sizes. A future definitive RCT of the psychosocial intervention is not feasible. The complex needs of some PWID may have limited their engagement in the intervention. More flexible delivery methods may have greater reach., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN66453696.

N2  - Appropriate complementary food is a must for optimum growth of infants and children. The food should be diverse and be given in sufficient quantities 2-4 times a day depending upon age. Poverty, food insecurity, and lack of awareness regarding the choice of nutritious food ingredients are deterrents to optimum complementary feeding. In Bangladesh, 77% of children do not receive appropriate complementary food and, hence, the high prevalence of childhood malnutrition. We developed ready-to-use complementary foods (RUCFs) using locally available food ingredients, rice/lentil and chickpea, which conform to standard specifications. These foods were found to be acceptable by children and their mothers compared to the Pushti packet, the cereal-based supplement used in the erstwhile National Nutrition Program of Bangladesh. In a cluster-randomized community-based trial in rural Bangladesh among more than 5,000 children, the efficacy of rice/lentil- and chickpea-based RUCFs was compared with another commonly used supplementary food called wheat-soy blend++ (WSB++) and a commercial product called Plumpy'doz. Deceleration in length for age was significantly lower (by 0.02-0.04/month) in the rice/lentil, Plumpy'doz, and chickpea groups compared to the control group at 18 months of age. Weight-for-length z-score decline was lower only in Plumpy'doz and chickpea groups. WSB++ was not different from the control group. In children who received chickpea RUCF or Plumpy'doz, the prevalence of stunting was 5-6% lower at 18 months. These foods can be used to prevent or treat malnutrition among children, particularly those from food-insecure households. Copyright © 2017 Nestec Ltd., Vevey/S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent to which housing instability is associated with gaps in health insurance coverage of preschool-age children., METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort, a nationally representative study of children born in the United States in 2001, was conducted to investigate associations between unstable housing-homelessness, multiple moves, or living with others and not paying rent-and children's subsequent health insurance gaps. Logistic regression was used to adjust for potentially confounding factors., RESULTS: Ten percent of children were unstably housed at age 2, and 11% had a gap in health insurance between ages 2 and 4. Unstably housed children were more likely to have gaps in insurance compared to stably housed children (16% vs 10%). Controlling for potentially confounding factors, the odds of a child insurance gap were significantly higher in unstably housed families than in stably housed families (adjusted odds ratio 1.27; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.61). The association was similar in alternative model specifications., CONCLUSIONS: In a US nationally representative birth cohort, children who were unstably housed at age 2 were at higher risk, compared to their stably housed counterparts, of experiencing health insurance gaps between ages 2 and 4 years. The findings from this study suggest that policy efforts to delink health insurance renewal processes from mailing addresses, and potentially routine screenings for housing instability as well as referrals to appropriate resources by pediatricians, would help unstably housed children maintain health insurance.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of victimization in patients with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (dual diagnosis) and compare them to the general population., METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey study conducted in the Netherlands, 9 different types of victimization (e.g., physical assault) were assessed with the Safety Monitor in patients with dual diagnosis (n = 243) and a sample of the general population (n = 10,865). Chi-square tests were used to compare patients with a weighted sample of the general population., RESULTS: Compared to the general population, patients with dual diagnosis were more likely to have been a victim of violence (60% vs. 11%), property crime (58% vs. 30%), and vandalism (21% vs. 14%) in the year preceding the assessment. Threats, sexual assault, physical assault, robbery, bicycle theft, other theft, and vandalism were more prevalent in patients with dual diagnosis compared to the general population. Car theft was more prevalent in the general population. The risk of burglary did not differ significantly between groups., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with dual diagnosis are highly prone to victimization. In patients with severe mental illness, victimization is associated with psychopathology, substance use, homelessness, and engagement in criminal activity. Future research is necessary to explore underlying mechanisms in patients with dual diagnosis and develop interventions to reduce their vulnerability for victimization.

T1  - Can Housing and Service Interventions Reduce Family Separations for Families Who Experience Homelessness?.

N2  - Family break-up is common in families experiencing homelessness. This paper examines the extent of separations of children from parents and of partners from each other and whether housing and service interventions reduced separations and their precursors among 1,857 families across 12 sites who participated in the Family Options Study. Families in shelters were randomized to offers of one of three interventions: permanent housing subsidies that reduce expenditures for rent to 30% of families' income, temporary rapid re-housing subsidies with some services directed at housing and employment, and transitional housing in supervised facilities with extensive psychosocial services. Each group was compared to usual care families who were eligible for that intervention but received no special offer. Twenty months later, permanent housing subsidies almost halved rates of child separation and more than halved rates of foster care placements; the other interventions did not affect separations significantly. Predictors of separation were primarily homelessness and drug abuse (all comparisons), and alcohol dependence (one comparison). Although housing subsidies reduced homelessness, alcohol dependence, intimate partner violence, and economic stressors, the last three variables had no association with child separations in the subsidy comparison; thus subsidies had indirect effects via reductions in homelessness. No intervention reduced partner separations. Copyright © Society for Community Research and Action 2016.

N2  - Substance use is highly prevalent among youth living with HIV (YLWH) and negatively impacts HIV care. This study sought to determine whether the CRAFFT (Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, and Trouble), designed to screen for problematic substance use, is reliably associated with substance use behaviors among YLWH. A cross-sectional sample of 2216 youth (ages 12-26) were recruited through the adolescent medicine trials network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. Participants completed a self-administered survey. Over half screened positive on the CRAFFT (i.e., >=2). Among frequent substance users, those older in age, behaviorally infected, with history of incarceration or unstably housed were more likely to screen positive on the CRAFFT. Study findings suggest that the CRAFFT reliably identifies youth who use substances. Thus, screening measures such as the CRAFFT should be utilized routinely in HIV clinical settings for youth.

N2  - PURPOSE: No research has examined childbirth from a national perspective among females emancipating from foster care. The present study fills this gap by: (1) documenting the rates of initial and repeat births among females ages 17 and 19 in a national prospective study and (2) identifying risk and protective factors at age 17 that predict childbirth between ages 17 and 19., METHODS: This study used data from the National Youth in Transition Database and Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System to identify risk and protective factors associated with childbirth in a national sample of transition-age female youth (N = 3,474)., RESULTS: The cumulative rate of childbirth by age 19 was 21%, with higher rates reported between ages 17 and 19 (17%; n = 602) compared with age 17 or earlier (9%; n = 313). In logistic regression analysis, black race and Hispanic ethnicity, placement with relatives, runaway status, trial home visit placement, early emancipation from foster care, and lifetime incarceration histories were associated with increased likelihood of childbirth. In contrast, school enrollment and employment skills were associated with decreased likelihood of childbirth. The multivariate odds of childbirth between ages 17 and 19 increased 10-fold if youth already had a child by age 17., CONCLUSIONS: Sexual health and pregnancy prevention programs should specifically target youths who already have children. Increased attention should be paid to adolescents placed with biological families and those with histories of criminal involvement. Copyright © 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

T1  - The Effects of Assisted Housing on Child Well-Being.
A1  - Newman, Sandra
A1  - Holupka, C Scott
Y1  - 2017//
Y2  - 20161109//
N2  - The most rigorous research on the causal effects of assisted housing on children's outcomes finds no such effects. The present study uses rich longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, augmented with Census, American Community Survey and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development administrative data, to unpack these nil effects. Analyses include 194 children ( X age = 6.2 years) living in assisted housing in 1995 or later who were 13-17 years old in 2002 or 2007, and an unassisted comparison group of 215 children who were income-eligible for, but never received, housing assistance. Results suggested no mean effects of living in assisted housing during childhood on adolescent cognitive, behavior, and health outcomes, addressing selection through propensity score matching and instrumental variables. However, quantile regressions suggest assisted housing provides an added boost for children with the best cognitive performance and fewest behavior problems but has opposite effects on children with the lowest cognitive scores and most behavior problems. Further tests indicate that these differences are not explained either by neighborhood effects or housing quality. A potentially fruitful avenue for future research investigates differences in how parents take advantage of the housing affordability provided by assisted housing to benefit their children.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Homelessness is associated with increased prevalence of mental health disorders, substance use disorders and mental health/substance use disorder comorbidity in the United States of America. Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) living in the United States are at increased risk for homelessness, and have also evidenced elevated mental health and substance use disorder prevalence relative to their non-MSM male counterparts., DESIGN AND METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from a randomised controlled trial estimating the diagnostic prevalence of substance use/mental health disorder comorbidity among a sample of homeless, substance-dependent MSM (DSM-IV verified; n = 131)., RESULTS: The most prevalent substance use/mental health disorder comorbidities were stimulant dependence comorbid with at least one depressive disorder (28%), alcohol dependence comorbid with at least one depressive disorder (26%) and stimulant dependence comorbid with antisocial personality disorder (25%)., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic depression and antisocial personality disorder both demonstrated high rates of prevalence among homeless, substance-dependent (particularly stimulant and alcohol dependent) MSM.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patients who leave hospital against medical advice (AMA) may be at risk of adverse health outcomes, medical complications, and readmission. In this study, we examined the characteristics of patients who left AMA after traumatic brain injury (TBI), their rates of follow-up visits, and readmission., METHODS: We retrospectively studied 106 consecutive patients who left the tertiary trauma center AMA (1.8% of all admitted patients with a TBI). Preinjury health and social issues, mechanism of injury, computed tomography findings, and injury markers were collected. They were correlated to compliance with follow-up visits and unplanned emergency room (ER) visits and readmission rates., RESULTS: The most prevalent premorbid health or social-related issues were alcohol abuse (33%) and assault as a mechanism of trauma (33%). Only 15 (14.2%) subjects came to follow-up visit for their TBI. Sixteen (15.1%) of the 106 subjects had multiple readmissions and/or ER visits related to substance abuse. Seven (6.6%) had multiple readmissions or ER visits with psychiatric reasons. Those patients with multiple readmissions and ER visits showed in higher proportion preexisting neurological condition (p=0.027), homelessness (p=0.012), previous neurosurgery (p=0.014), preexisting encephalomalacia (p=0.011), and had a higher ISS score (p=0.014) than those who were not readmitted multiple times., CONCLUSIONS: The significantly increased risks of multiple follow-up visits and readmission among TBI patients who leave hospital AMA are related to a premorbid vulnerability and psychosocial issues. Clinicians should target AMA TBI patients with premorbid vulnerability for discharge transition interventions.

N2  - Mental illness and substance use are overrepresented within urban homeless populations. This paper compared substance use patterns between homeless individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum (SS) and bipolar disorders (BD) using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. From a sample of 497 subjects drawn from Vancouver, Canada who participated in the At Home/Chez Soi study, 146 and 94 homeless individuals were identified as BD and SS, respectively. In the previous 12 months, a greater proportion of BD homeless reported greater use of cocaine (chi = 20.0, p = 0.000), amphetamines (chi = 13,8, p = 0.000), opiates (chi = 24.6, p = 0.000), hallucinogens (chi = 11.7, p = 0.000), cannabinoids (chi = 5.05, p = 0.034), and tranquilizers (chi = 7.95, p = 0.004) compared to SS. Cocaine and opiates were significantly associated with BD homeless (chi = 39.06, df = 2, p < 0.000). The present study illustrates the relationship between substance use and BD in a vulnerable urban population of homeless, affected by adverse psychosocial factors and severe psychiatric conditions.

N2  - Individual placement and support (IPS) has not been tested experimentally among people recently housed with a scattered-site Housing First program. Ninety recently housed people were randomized to IPS or usual services. Regression models estimated via GEE were used to compare employment outcomes. Over 8 months of follow-up with good fidelity, fifteen (34 %) people in the IPS group versus nine (22 %) in the control group found competitive employment (p = 0.16). Adjusted odds of obtaining competitive employment were greater in the IPS group (OR 2.42, 95 %CI 1.13-5.16). Other employment outcomes were not significantly different between groups. Satisfaction with services was greater in the group receiving IPS. In this study, IPS was a modestly useful adjunct to scattered-site Housing First for people with mental illness who have been homeless.

N2  - Homeless youth have high rates of substance use and often lack connection to social services. Outreach is critical for connecting youth to services, but factors influencing their outreach engagement are unknown. This study examined predictors of meetings with outreach workers among 79 non-service connected, substance using homeless youth between 14 and 24 years of age. Results provide direction to service providers in that older age, higher levels of depressive symptoms, fewer drug-related problems, and no use of hard drugs within the prior 30 days predicted higher meeting attendance. Future research is needed testing strategies that overcome barriers to outreach engagement.

N2  - A randomized controlled trial was conducted with homeless gay and bisexual men to assess the impact of two culturally sensitive intervention programs on reduction of drug use and risky sexual behavior. In this study, gay and bisexual men between 18 and 46 years of age were randomly assigned to one of two culturally sensitive behavioral intervention programs: a Nurse Case Management Plus Contingency Management (NCM + CM; n = 204) or a Standard Education Plus Contingency Management (SE + CM; n = 210) program. Regardless of group assignment, significant and clinically relevant reductions were observed in stimulant use over time. Multivariable predictors of stimulant use at 4- and 8-month follow-up evaluations were recent injection drug use, tested positive for HIV, or for use of amphetamine. Data revealed a significant linear decline over time for those who had sex with multiple partners. Furthermore, being HIV positive was associated with reporting multiple partners, while higher homophobia scores and having children were inversely related to reports of having sex with multiple partners at follow-up. Culturally sensitive approaches are needed to successfully reduce drug use and risky sexual activities among gay and bisexual populations.

N2  - Incarcerated women experience myriad individual, interpersonal, and structural factors leading to arrest and rearrest. This study examined risk profiles of women experiencing initial and repeat incarcerations. The sample included 521 women recruited from two prisons in North Carolina and enrolled in a HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention trial. Variables included socio-demographics, structural/economic factors, sexual and substance use behaviors, STDs, victimization history, and depressive symptoms. Bivariate and multivariable analyses identified risk differences. Compared to women incarcerated for the first time, women with repeat incarcerations reported significantly greater economic instability, substance use and sexual risk behaviors, laboratory-confirmed STDs, and victimization during childhood and adulthood. Multivariable logistic regression found women with repeat incarcerations experienced greater unstable housing, injection drug use, crack cocaine use, concurrent sex partners, and childhood sexual victimization. Findings can inform the development of prevention programs by addressing economic instability, sexual risk, and substance use among women prisoners.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Universal access to the School Breakfast Program (SBP) is intended to help low-income and food-insecure students overcome barriers to eating breakfast. However, SBP participation is often still low despite universal access. Further information is needed with regard to these children's breakfast behaviors, and in particular breakfast behaviors among youth from food-insecure families, to inform effective breakfast interventions., OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine breakfast behaviors among a large sample of urban students with universal access to the SBP and to identify differences in breakfast behaviors among children from food-secure compared with food-insecure households., METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 821 fourth- through sixth-grade students and their parents from 16 schools was conducted. Students reported the foods/drinks selected and location of obtaining food/drink on the morning of data collection, parents reported household food security status using the 6-item Food Security Survey Module, and the school district provided SBP participation data during the fall semester of 2013. Multivariable linear regression models accounting for school-level clustering were used to examine differences in breakfast behaviors across 3 levels of household food security: food secure, low food secure, and very low food secure., RESULTS: Students participated in the SBP 31.2% of possible days, with 13% never participating in the SBP. One-fifth (19.4%) of students purchased something from a corner store for breakfast, and 16.9% skipped breakfast. Forty-six percent of students were food insecure; few differences in breakfast behaviors were observed across levels of food security., CONCLUSIONS: Despite universal access to the SBP, participation in the SBP is low. Breakfast skipping and selection of foods of low nutritional quality in the morning are common, regardless of household food security status. Additional novel implementation of the SBP and addressing students' breakfast preferences may be necessary to further reduce barriers to students obtaining a free, healthful breakfast.

N2  - AIMS: To follow-up hospitalization for physical diseases among homeless men and women compared with a control group from the general population. The study also investigated the changes in the difference between the homeless men and women and the general population over time by comparing two cohorts of homeless people (2000-2002 and 1996)., METHODS: A total of 3887 people (24% women) who were homeless during the period 2000-2002 were compared with 11,661 people from the general population with respect to hospitalization for physical diseases and injuries (2000-2010). Indirect comparisons were used to compare the relative risk (RR) of hospitalization between the cohort of people who were homeless in 2000-2002 with a cohort of those who were homeless in 1996., RESULTS: Homeless people have an RR of being hospitalized for physical diseases twice that of the general population. The largest differences were found in skin diseases, infections, injury/poisoning and diseases of the respiratory system. Indirect comparison between people who were homeless in 2000-2002 and 1996 showed an increasing difference between young (18-35 years) homeless men and men in the control group (RR 1.32). The difference had also increased between homeless men and men in the control group for hospitalization for heart disease (RR 1.35), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR 2.60) and poisoning (RR 1.89). Among women, the difference had decreased between homeless women and women in the control group for skin disease (RR 0.20) and injury/poisoning (RR 0.60). There was no significant difference between the sexes in the two homeless cohorts., CONCLUSIONS: There was no improvement in excess hospitalization among homeless people over time. The difference between young homeless men and young men in the general population increased between 1996 and 2000-2002.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition and infection are major barriers to educational access and achievement in low-income countries and also work in conjunction with each other in deteriorating wellness and productivity of school adolescents., METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of school-based nutrition education using a peer-led approach, health promotion through school media and health clubs. Data were collected at baseline, midline and end line from sampled participants. To account for the effect of time trend, the difference was measured using a repeated measure analysis. Variables that have p<=0.25 in the bivariate analyses were entered into multivariables to determine the independent effect of interventions., RESULTS: There is a significant difference in food variety between food secure and insecure households (p<0.01). A significant improvement of animal source dietary intake was observed among intervention schools (p<0.001) that was significantly associated with an intervention [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.26, confidence interval (CI): 0.16, 0.42], male gender (AOR=0.48, CI: 0.31, 0.73) and household economic status (AOR=1.69, CI: 1.01, 2.84). The control group had high body mass index (BMI) at baseline, but a significant improvement was observed among the intervention schools, which positively associated with male gender (AOR=4.13, CI: 2.38, 7.15) and having a middle-income family (AOR=2.93, CI: 1.92, 6.15)., CONCLUSION: This study showed that by integrating a dietary intervention into school-based activities, there might be significant improvements in dietary intake of primary school adolescents. Therefore, school-based nutrition education programs should be a part of comprehensive school health programs to reach the students and potentially their families.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Out-of-home care (OoHC) refers to young people removed from their families by the state because of abuse, neglect or other adversities. Many of the young people experience poor mental health and social function before, during and after leaving care. Rigorously evaluated interventions are urgently required. This publication describes the protocol for the Ripple project and notes early findings from a controlled trial demonstrating the feasibility of the work. The Ripple project is implementing and evaluating a complex mental health intervention that aims to strengthen the therapeutic capacities of carers and case managers of young people (12-17 years) in OoHC., METHODS: The study is conducted in partnership with mental health, substance abuse and social services in Melbourne, with young people as participants. It has three parts: 1. Needs assessment and implementation of a complex mental health intervention; 2. A 3-year controlled trial of the mental health, social and economic outcomes; and 3. Nested process evaluation of the intervention., RESULTS: Early findings characterising the young people, their carers and case managers and implementing the intervention are available. The trial Wave 1 includes interviews with 176 young people, 52% of those eligible in the study population, 104 carers and 79 case managers., CONCLUSIONS: Implementing and researching an affordable service system intervention appears feasible and likely to be applicable in other places and countries. Success of the intervention will potentially contribute to reducing mental ill-health among these young people, including suicide attempts, self-harm and substance abuse, as well as reducing homelessness, social isolation and contact with the criminal justice system., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12615000501549 .

N2  - OBJECTIVES: (1) To determine whether street children who visit drop-in centers experience better physical and mental health, and engage in less substance use than street children who do not visit centers. (2) To determine whether the duration of attendance at a center has an impact on the above outcomes., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study with 69 street children from two drop-in centers in New Delhi, India (attenders) and a comparison group of 65 street children who did not visit drop-in centers (non-attenders). We used pretested questionnaires to assess their physical health, substance use status and mental health., RESULTS: Attenders experienced fewer ill health outcomes, engaged in less substance use, and had better mental health outcomes than non-attenders (p<0.01). For every month of attendance at a drop-in center, street children experienced 2.1% (95% CI 0% to 4.1%, p=0.05) fewer ill health outcomes per month and used 4.6% (95% CI 1.3% to 8%, p=0.01) fewer substances. Street children were also less likely to have been a current substance user than a never substance user for every additional month of attendance at a center (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.66-0.96, p=0.02). Duration of drop-in center attendance was not a significant factor in predicting mental health problems., CONCLUSION: Drop-in centers may improve the physical health of street children and reduce their substance abuse. Rigorous longitudinal studies are needed to better determine if drop-in centers impact the health and substance use status of street children in LMICs. Copyright A© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) predicts homelessness in adulthood, and whether the persistence of childhood ADHD through adolescence influences the likelihood of homelessness., METHOD: A 33-year prospective, controlled, follow-up was performed of clinic-referred, 6- to 12-year-old boys of white ethnicity with ADHD (probands; mean = 8), at a mean age of 41 years (follow-up [FU] = 41). Comparisons, children without ADHD from the same medical center, were matched for age and socioeconomic status (SES). Both groups were evaluated at a mean age of 18 years (FU18). Homelessness was assessed at FU41 in 134 of 207 probands (65%) and 136 of 178 (76%) comparisons. We tested the following: the relationship between childhood ADHD and homelessness; whether adolescent dysfunctions (conduct disorder, non-alcohol substance use disorder, arrests, and school dropout) accounted for this relationship, if found; and whether ADHD that persisted through FU18 elevated probands' homelessness rate., RESULTS: Probands had significantly higher rates of homelessness than comparisons (23.7% vs. 4.4%; chi21 = 21.15, df = 1, p < .001). In a multivariate analysis, including childhood ADHD and covariates, the probands' significant elevation of homelessness remained (odds ratio [OR] = 3.60, 95% CI = 1.32-9.76, p = .01). Probands with persistent ADHD through adolescence had significantly more homelessness than remitted probands (chi21 = 12.73, p < .001), but this relationship was no longer significant when conduct disorder at FU18 was controlled (OR = 1.97, 95% CI = 0.89-4.38, p = .09)., CONCLUSION: Among boys of white ethnicity who were followed into adulthood, childhood ADHD was associated with an elevated rate of homelessness. Findings point to the need for clinical monitoring of childhood ADHD through adolescence, even when ADHD does not persist, in hopes of mitigating a cascade of malfunction that includes homelessness.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to better understand the prevalence and correlates of substance use behaviors among HIV-infected adolescents in HIV care settings., METHODS: A cross-sectional sample of 2216 youth living with HIV (YLWH; ages 12-26) were recruited through the Adolescent Trials Network for HIV Interventions. Participants completed a one-time survey on sociodemographic factors, substance use and health behaviors. We used logistic regression models to understand the correlates of substance use outcomes., RESULTS: Overall, weekly or more frequent tobacco use was reported by 32.9% of participants, 27.5% marijuana use, and 21.3% alcohol use; and 22.5% reported any other illicit drug use. In multivariable models, young MSM had higher odds of reporting each substance use behavior, and transgender women had increased odds of marijuana and other illicit drug use. Criminal justice involvement, unstable housing, condomless sex, and suboptimal antiretroviral therapy was associated with increased risk of substance use behaviors., CONCLUSIONS: Study findings highlight the need for regular screening for substance use in HIV care settings in order to improve access to and delivery of culturally competent substance use prevention and treatment services.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) disproportionately affects immigrants, HIV-infected individuals, and those living in crowded settings such as homeless shelters and correctional facilities. Although the majority of jails and prisons use a tuberculin skin test (TST) for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) screening, limited data exist on the clinical performance and costs of the TST compared to interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) in this setting., METHODS: A prospective pilot study comparing cost between TST and an IGRA (QuantiFERON Gold In-tube, QFT-GIT) for the detection of LTBI in a convenience sample of inmates entering the Dallas County Jail (DCJ) was conducted June-October 2014. Participants completed a risk questionnaire, TST placement, QFT-GIT testing, and were offered opt-out HIV-Ab testing. LTBI prevalence based on TST and QFT-GIT results, an evaluation of discordant results and a cost analysis are presented., RESULTS: A total of 529 subjects were enrolled. The majority were male (75 %), and 46 % were Black, 29 % White, and 24 % Hispanic. Most (85 %) had been previously incarcerated. Over 28 % of participants were released prior to TST reading, with paired QFT-GIT and TST results available for 351 subjects. Of these, nine (2.6 %) tested positive by TST and 47 (13.4 %) tested positive by QFT-GIT. It costs $23.27 more per inmate per year to screen with QFT-GIT than TST in this population, though the cost per LTBI case detected was nearly three times higher for TST than QFT-GIT ($1247 v $460)., CONCLUSIONS: We found a substantially higher rate of QFT-GIT positivity compared to TST in this sample of individuals entering the Dallas County Jail. Although no gold standard exists, this finding may indicate under-recognized LTBI in this setting. QFT-GIT as an initial screening tool was more time-efficient, had four-fold fewer labor costs and provided results on more individuals when compared with the TST. The overall cost of QFT-GIT was $23.27 more per inmate per year, though the cost per LTBI case detected was nearly three times higher for TST than QFT-GIT. Further research is needed to determine the long-term performance of IGRA testing in the correctional setting and the public health implications of pairing QFT-GIT screening with other tests for communicable diseases.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: "Housing First" has been shown to improve housing stability in homeless individuals with mental illness, but had not been empirically tested in homeless youth. We aimed to evaluate the effect of "Housing First" on housing stability in homeless youth aged 18 to 24 years participating in At Home/Chez Soi, a 24-month randomized trial of "Housing First" in 5 Canadian cities., METHODS: Homeless individuals with mental illness were randomized to receive "Housing First" (combined with assertive community treatment or intensive case management depending on their level of need) or treatment as usual. We defined our primary outcome, housing stability, as the percent of days stably housed as a proportion of days for which residence data were available., RESULTS: Of 2148 participants who completed baseline interviews and were randomized, 7% (n = 156) were youth aged 18 to 24 years; 87 received "Housing First" and 69 received treatment as usual. In an adjusted analysis, youth in "Housing First" were stably housed a mean of 437 of 645 (65%) days for which data were available compared with youth in treatment as usual, who were stably housed a mean of 189 of 582 (31%) days for which data were available, resulting in an adjusted mean difference of 34% (95% confidence interval, 24%-45%; P < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: "Housing First" was associated with improved housing stability in homeless youth with mental illness. Future research should explore whether adaptations of the model for youth yield additional improvements in housing stability and other outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Injection drug use remains a primary driver of HIV and HCV-related harms globally. However, there is a gap in efforts to prevent individuals from transitioning into injecting. People who inject drugs (PWID) play a key role in the transition of others into injecting, and while behavioral interventions have been developed to address this phenomenon, socio-structural approaches remain unexplored. To that end, we hypothesize that certain interventions designed to reduce injecting-related risk behaviors may also reduce the risk that PWID expose and introduce others into injecting. Identifying the preventive potential of existing interventions will inform broader efforts to prevent injecting and related harms., METHODS: The Preventing Injecting by Modifying Existing Responses (PRIMER) study is a multi-country mixed methods study with an aim to investigate whether specific interventions (e.g., opioid substitution therapy, supervised injection facilities, stable housing, incarceration environments) and related factors (e.g., public injecting and gender) influence the likelihood that PWID initiate others into injecting. This study will (1) investigate the PWID participation in injection initiation; (2) identify factors influencing the risk that PWID expose others to or facilitate injection initiation; (3) describe drug scene roles that increase the risk of PWID facilitating injection initiation; and (4) evaluate the impact of structural, social, or biomedical interventions on the risk that PWID facilitate injection initiation. It does so by pooling observational data from cohort studies of PWID in six cities: Vancouver, Canada; San Diego, USA; Tijuana, Mexico; Paris, Marseille, and Bordeaux, France., RESULTS: Team members are conducting a prospective, multi-site study of PWID (n = 3050) in North America and France that includes quantitative and qualitative data collection through four separate cohort studies of PWID (San Diego, STAHR II; Tijuana, El Cuete IV; Vancouver, V-DUS; Bordeaux, Marseille, Paris and Strasbourg, COSINUS)., CONCLUSIONS: PRIMER is the largest study of injection initiation to date and the first to investigate structural approaches to preventing injection drug use initiation. Findings have the potential to inform the development and scale up of new and existing interventions to prevent transitions into injecting., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Preventing Injecting by Modifying Existing Responses (PRIMER), NIDA DP2-DA040256-01 .

N2  - BACKGROUND: Social networks play positive and negative roles in the lives of homeless people influencing their alcohol and/or other drug (AOD) and HIV risk behaviors., METHODS: We developed a four-session computer-assisted social network motivational interviewing intervention for homeless adults transitioning into housing. We examined the acceptability of the intervention among staff and residents at an organization that provides permanent supportive housing through iterative rounds of beta testing. Staff were 3 men and 3 women who were residential support staff (i.e., case managers and administrators). Residents were 8 men (7 African American, 1 Hispanic) and 3 women (2 African American, 1 Hispanic) who had histories of AOD and HIV risk behaviors. We conducted a focus group with staff who gave input on how to improve the delivery of the intervention to enhance understanding and receptivity among new residents. We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews and collected self-report satisfaction data from residents., RESULTS: Three themes emerged over the course of the resident interviews. Residents reported that the intervention was helpful in discussing their social network, that seeing the visualizations was more impactful than just talking about their network, and that the intervention prompted thoughts about changing their AOD use and HIV risk networks., CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first of its kind that has developed, with input from Housing First staff and residents, a motivational interviewing intervention that targets both the structure and composition of one's social network. These results suggest that providing visual network feedback with a guided motivational interviewing discussion is a promising approach to supporting network change.

N2  - The study aimed to evaluate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for posttraumatic stress (PTS), depression, anxiety, and anger in street children by a randomized controlled trial of CBT versus a waitlist control. It was conducted in 8 residential facilities for street children in Mexico City, with assessments at baseline, posttreatment, and 3 months later. Children who reported at least moderate posttraumatic stress, and fulfilled the study requirement were enrolled in the study (N = 100, 12-18 years old, 36 boys). There were 51 children randomized to CBT and 49 to the waitlist condition. Randomization was stratified by gender. CBT consisted of 12 individual 1-hour sessions administered weekly by 2 trained, master's-level clinicians. Outcome measures included self-reports of PTS, depression, anxiety, and anger; global improvement was assessed by the independent evaluator. Compared to participants in the waitlist condition participants in CBT showed a significant reduction in all symptoms, with effects sizes of 1.73 to 1.75. At follow up there was attrition (n = 36), and no change from posttreatment scores. The study did find statistically significant improvement in symptoms in the CBT group compared to the waitlist condition; symptoms remained stable at 3 months. The study found that CBT for trauma in a sample of street children provided a reduction of a broad range of mental health symptoms.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Prior studies have shown that Group Motivational Interviewing (GMI) for dually diagnosed patients holds promise for increasing treatment engagement., OBJECTIVES: The current study evaluated the impact of a novel GMI protocol that included tobacco-specific components (referred to as "Tobacco GMI or T-GMI") targeting enhanced engagement in smoking cessation treatment., METHODS: Thirty-seven primary alcohol and nicotine-dependent cigarette smoking homeless Veterans with co-morbid psychiatric conditions were recruited to receive four GMI sessions over 4 consecutive days. The first 16 participants received standard GMI, aimed at enhancing engagement in substance abuse treatment and for reducing substance use, while the remaining 21 participants received a modified "tobacco-specific" GMI protocol (T-GMI) that included additional content specific to cessation of tobacco use and enhancing smoking cessation treatment, in addition to the standard substance abuse content of GMI., RESULTS: Participants in T-GMI were more likely to attend tobacco cessation programming (p = .05), as well as to attend combined tobacco cessation programming with prescribed nicotine replacement therapy (p = .03), compared to those in standard GMI. Differences between treatment conditions with respect to alcohol and illicit drug use outcomes were not significant, although overall substance use declined over time in both groups., CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Results suggest that inclusion of tobacco-specific components in the context of GMI for substance abuse may enhance treatment engagement for tobacco cessation behaviors among dually diagnosed nicotine dependent homeless patients, a highly vulnerable population for which interventional resources targeting engagement in smoking cessation treatment has historically been lacking.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol is the leading psychoactive substance consumed in France, with about 15 million regular consumers. The National institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) considers alcohol abuse to be more than 14 units of alcohol a week for men and 7 units for women. The specific complication of alcoholism is the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Its incidence reaches up to 30 % and its main complications are delirium tremens, restlessness, extended hospital stay, higher morbidity, and psychiatric and cognitive impairment. Without appropriate treatment, delirium tremens can lead to death in up to 50 % of patients., METHODS/DESIGN: This prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled study versus placebo will be conducted in twelve French intensive care units (ICU). Patients with an alcohol intake level higher than the NIAAA threshold, who are under mechanical ventilation, will be included. The primary objective is to determine whether baclofen is more efficient than placebo in preventing restlessness-related side effects in the ICU. Secondary outcomes include mechanical ventilation duration, length of ICU stay, and cumulative doses of sedatives and painkillers received within 28 days of ICU admission. Restlessness-related side effects in the ICU are defined as unplanned extubation, medical disposal removal (such as urinary catheter, venous or arterial line or surgical drain), falling out of bed, ICU runaway (leaving ICU without physician's approval), immobilisation device removal, self-aggression or aggression towards medical staff. Daily doses of baclofen/placebo will be guided by daily creatinine clearance assessment., DISCUSSION: Restlessness in alcoholic patients is a life-threatening issue in ICUs. BACLOREA is a randomised study assessing the capacity of baclofen to prevent agitation in mechanically ventilated patients. Enrolment of 314 patients will begin in June 2016 and is expected to end in October 2018., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723383 , registered on 3 March 2016.

N2  - UNLABELLED: Elevated prevalence estimates of sexually transmitted infections and sexual risk behaviors have commonly been reported among homeless and precariously housed adults. Research has increasingly recognized the importance and impact of structural factors, such as housing, on risk behaviors. Several researchers have argued that supported housing interventions, such as Housing First (HF), may contribute to reductions in sexual risk behavior. The present study is the first analysis of a randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of HF on unprotected sex among formerly homeless and marginally housed adults with mental illness and complex comorbidities., METHODS: Generalized estimating equations were used to examine between-group differences in unprotected sex., RESULTS: Compared with treatment as usual, no association was found between HF and unprotected sex over the 24 months of follow-up. Several other variables were significantly and independently associated with unprotected sex., CONCLUSION: Results suggest that further interventions are needed to reduce unprotected sex among homeless and unstably housed individuals with mental illness.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy may increase a woman's susceptibility to HIV. Maternal HIV acquisition during pregnancy and lactation is associated with increased perinatal and lactational HIV transmission. There are no published reports of preexposure prophylaxis use after the first trimester of pregnancy or during lactation., OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to report the use of preexposure prophylaxis and to identify gaps in HIV prevention services for women who were at substantial risk of HIV preconception and during pregnancy and lactation at 2 United States medical centers., STUDY DESIGN: Chart review was performed on women who were identified as "at significant risk" for HIV acquisition preconception (women desiring pregnancy) and during pregnancy and lactation at 2 medical centers in San Francisco and New York from 2010-2015. Women were referred to specialty clinics for women who were living with or were at substantial risk of HIV., RESULTS: Twenty-seven women who were identified had a median age of 27 years. One-half of the women had unstable housing, 22% of the women had ongoing intimate partner violence, and 22% of the women had active substance use. Twenty-six women had a male partner living with HIV, and 1 woman had a male partner who had sex with men. Of the partners who were living with HIV, 73% (19/26) were receiving antiretroviral therapy, and 42% (11/26) had documented viral suppression. Thirty-nine percent (10/26) of partners had known detectable virus, and 19% (5/26) had unknown viral loads. Women were identified by clinicians, health educators, and health departments. Approximately one-third of the women were identified preconception (8/27); the majority of the women were identified during pregnancy (18/27) with a median gestational age of 20 weeks (interquartile range, 11-23), and 1 woman was identified in the postpartum period. None of the pregnant referrals had received safer conception counseling to reduce HIV transmission. Twenty-six percent of all women (7/27) were eligible for postexposure prophylaxis at referral, of whom 57% (4/7) were offered postexposure prophylaxis. In 30% (8/27), the last HIV exposure was not assessed and postexposure prophylaxis was not offered. The median time from identification as "at substantial risk" to consultation was 30 days (interquartile range, 2-62). Two women were lost to follow up before consultation. One woman who was identified as "at significant risk" was not referred because of multiple pregnancy complications. She remained in obstetrics care and was HIV-negative at delivery but was lost to follow up until 10 months after delivery when she was diagnosed with HIV. No other seroconversions were identified. Of referrals who presented and were offered preexposure prophylaxis, 67% women (16/24) chose to take it, which was relatively consistent whether the women were preconception (5/8), pregnant (10/15), or after delivery (1/1). Median length of time on preexposure prophylaxis was 30 weeks (interquartile range, 20-53). One-half of women (10/20) who were in care at delivery did not attend a postpartum visit., CONCLUSION: Women at 2 United States centers frequently chose to use preexposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention when it was offered preconception and during pregnancy and lactation. Further research and education are needed to close critical gaps in screening for women who are at risk of HIV for pre- and postexposure prophylaxis eligibility and gaps in care linkage before and during pregnancy and lactation. Postpartum women are particularly vulnerable to loss-to-follow-up and miss opportunities for safe and effective HIV prevention. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Black and Latino homeless youth are at high risk of HIV, and yet no HIV prevention interventions have been specifically designed for these groups. Given the success of parent-child intervention programs for housed Black and Latino youth, this study examined parental relationships that could be leveraged for future HIV prevention efforts targeting minority homeless youth, specifically the associations among presence of parents in social networks, parental influence, and parental support. A convenience sample of Black, Latino, and White homeless youth (N = 754) was recruited from three drop-in centers in Los Angeles. Participants completed a computerized, self-administered questionnaire and an interviewer-led personal social network interview. Multivariate logistic regression models assessed the association between parental relationships and sexual risk behaviors. Forty-five percent (n = 338) of youth identified a parent in their network. Having at least one parent in their network was significantly associated with decreased odds of using a condom for Black and White youth. Black youth were almost four times more likely to report being tested for HIV if they spoke to their parents about sex, whereas Latino youth were 91 % less likely to report being tested for HIV if they talked with their parents about sex. Black youth who identified a parent as a positive influence (i.e., promoting condom use or discouraging multiple partners) were almost four times more likely to have used a condom during their last sexual encounter. Parent-child HIV prevention interventions targeting homeless youth would benefit from culturally tailored adaptations.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Although youth homelessness presents a significant public health problem, the needs of homeless youths with mental illness, as distinct from adults, are not well understood. This study examined the unique demographic, clinical, and service use characteristics of homeless youths., METHODS: At Home/Chez Soi was a large randomized controlled trial of the Housing First model in five cities in Canada. Of 2,255 participants, 7% (N=164) were youths ages 18 to 24. Youths were compared with older participants on baseline demographic, clinical, and service use characteristics., RESULTS: More youths than adults had not finished high school (76% versus 54%), had a drug use disorder (66% versus 52%), and had been assaulted in the past six months (44% versus 36%) (all p<.05). Fewer than half the youths (49%) had a regular medical doctor, 50% reported unmet need for health care, and 61% visited an emergency department in the past six months., CONCLUSIONS: This sample of homeless youths with mental illness had low education, high rates of substance use disorders and victimization, and problems accessing services. These findings suggest that youths have trajectories to homelessness and service needs that are distinct from adults and may guide future planning for this vulnerable population.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Several studies have reported pronounced racial/ethnic differences in smoking behavior among homeless youth. Better understanding the factors underlying racial/ethnic differences in daily smoking among homeless youth may help inform programs to reduce smoking in this population., METHODS: Data come from a probability sample of homeless youth in Los Angeles County collected between 2008 and 2009. The sample includes 116 African American, 99 Hispanic, and 119 White youth with ages ranging from 13 to 24 years. Chi-square tests were used to test the differences in daily smoking among African American, Hispanic, and White youth. Propensity score and doubly robust methods were used to produce a less biased estimate of the association between daily smoking and race/ethnicity after having removed the effect of potential confounders., RESULTS: The daily smoking rate for White youth was 70.1%, more than 31 percentage points than the rates for either African American or Hispanic youth. Propensity score analysis revealed that the majority of the racial/ethnic differences in smoking rates could be explained by differences in homelessness severity, although background characteristics and comorbidity were relevant as well., CONCLUSIONS: As programs are developed to reduce smoking among homeless youth, results suggest that additional outreach may be needed to engage White youth in services. Also, smoking prevention programs may benefit from incorporating a social network-based approach that assists youth in fostering relationships with lower-risk peers, as well as addressing other forms of substance use. Incorporating these elements may help reduce the large racial/ethnic disparities in daily smoking among homeless youth., IMPLICATIONS: This report extends the small existing literature on racial/ethnic differences in smoking among homeless youth in two important respects. First, it confirms differences in daily smoking, an important indicator of dependence, across racial/ethnic groups. Second, it seeks to understand the extent to which differences in smoking can be explained by demographic characteristics (other than race/ethnicity), background factors, homelessness severity, and comorbidity characteristics known to be associated with substance use among homeless youth.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The predictors of long-term antipsychotic polypharmacy (APP) initiation are poorly understood. Existing research has been hampered by residual confounding, failure to exclude cross-titration, and difficulties in separating the timing of predictors and APP administration., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) case register, we identified all adult patients with serious mental illness (SMI) who were receiving care between 1st July 2011 and 30th June 2012. Exposures measured between 1st July and 31st December 2011 included socio-demographic, socioeconomic, clinical and service use characteristics. We then determined if long-term APP (six or more months) had been initiated between 1st January and 30th June 2012. Multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for socio-demographic and socioeconomic factors, were built to investigate the associations between the above factors and the initiation of long-term APP., RESULTS: We identified 6857 adults with SMI receiving SLaM care, of whom 115 (1.7%) were newly prescribed long-term APP. In the adjusted models, predictors of long-term APP initiation included: symptoms (severity of hallucinations and/or delusions), previous treatments (clozapine and long-acting injectable antipsychotic agents), service use (more contact with outpatient services, community treatment order receipt), social factors (higher area-level deprivation, homelessness) and socio-demographic status (younger age, not in a relationship)., CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight that certain patient groups are at an increased risk for long-term APP initiation. Identifying these groups earlier in their treatment could encourage clinicians to employ a broader range of interventions in addition to pharmacotherapy to reduce the risk of APP prescribing.

N2  - Evidence documenting effects of food assistance programs, household food insecurity, and nutrition knowledge on health outcomes is building. Using data from a sub-sample of adults who are 185% of the poverty line from the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 2,171), we examine whether household food insecurity, food stamp take-up, and use of informal food supports are associated with health risk among low-income households. Findings indicate that while nutrition knowledge provides protection against health risk in food secure households, the health benefits of nutrition knowledge were not evident in food insecure households. We discuss these findings in light of current policy and practice interventions that recognize the importance of providing healthy, affordable food options for food insecure households.

N2  - BACKGROUND: High attrition among research participants undermines the validity and generalizability of field research. This study contrasted two incentivizing methods--money orders (MOs) or rechargeable incentive cards (RICs)--with regard to rates of participants' study engagement and follow-up contact over a 6-month period., METHODS: Substance abusers (N = 303) in Los Angeles, California were recruited and randomized to either an MO (control) or RIC (experimental) condition. All participants were asked to call the researchers at the beginning of each calendar month for the ensuing 5 months to update their locator information, even if nothing had changed. Each call resulted in a $10 payment, issued immediately via the RIC system or by MO by mail. Research staff located and interviewed all participants at Month 6. Contact logs assessed level of effort required to locate participants and conduct follow-up interviews., RESULTS: Relative to controls, RIC participants, especially those with low ability to defer gratification, initiated more monthly calls. Six-month follow-up rates did not differ between RIC (75%) and controls (79%), though the RIC condition was associated with an average staff time savings of 39.8 minutes per study participant., DISCUSSION: For longitudinal public health research involving itinerant study participants, the RIC method produces a modest benefit in study engagement and reduced staff time devoted to participant tracking and payments. However, the overall cost-effectiveness of this approach will depend on the pricing model of the card-issuing vendor (which in turns depends on the scale of the project, with per-unit costs falling for larger projects).

N2  - Service provision using "one-stop shopping" of medical, psychiatric, and case management services at the same location has been associated with superior client retention. The Yadumu project tested this premise, with attention to HIV-infected African Americans. Each client was assigned a case manager, who arranged meetings with mental health, substance abuse, and medical care professionals. The Center for Mental Health Services, National Outcome Measures (CMHS NOMs) questionnaire was used to evaluate client progress. Data were collected longitudinally and the program evaluation was performed by an outside center. Among 129 clients, 47% were male, 30% were female, and 22% were transgender. The majority (72%) were African American. Clients who lived in detox/drug treatment programs had higher completion rates (48%) than those who were homeless or otherwise housed (28%) (p = 0.04). Logistic regression was used to assess associations between independent factors and retention. Clients satisfied with their housing situation were less likely to retain in the program than those who were not satisfied with their housing situation (OR = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.03-0.78). High discharge rates among HIV-infected people were observed and may reflect the unstable circumstances of the population studied, but structured residential programs could be advantageous for improving retention.

N2  - OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: The diagnostics of latent tuberculosis infection in Poland using the tuberculin skin test is challenging due to the obligatory Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccinations. Interferon-gamma release assays are still very rarely used for diagnostics. We compared the tuberculin skin test and the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test to evaluate the degree of latent tuberculosis infection in at-risk groups for tuberculosis (homeless, close contacts, periodic contacts, nursing-home attendees) and in healthy individuals., METHODS: QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube tests were carried out on 785 individuals from the homeless (n=150), close contacts (n=171), periodic contacts (n=163), nursing-home attendees (n=152), and healthy individuals (n=149). The tuberculin skin test was performed on 129, 156, 147, 148, and 121 participants, respectively. We evaluated the (a) correlation between serum concentrations of interferon gamma and the tuberculin-skin-test induration diameter; (b) between the number of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube-positive results and the tuberculin-skin-test diameter in the studied groups; and (c) agreement between both tests and the kappa coefficient using the tuberculin-skin-test diameters of 5, 10, and 15mm., RESULTS: Larger tuberculin-skin-test induration diameters were associated with elevated serum concentrations of interferon gamma. We found a positive correlation between the number of positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube screening results and the tuberculin-skin-test induration diameter. The agreement between QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube and tuberculin-skin-test screening results improved with increasing tuberculin-skin-test induration diameter., CONCLUSION: Based on measures of tuberculin-skin-test induration diameter alone, it is difficult to diagnose latent tuberculosis infection with certainty. The agreement of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test increases with the tuberculin-skin-test diameter. Tuberculin-skin-test diameters larger than 15mm are more likely to be associated with active infection. Copyright © 2015 Asian African Society for Mycobacteriology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Retention of male people who inject drugs (PWIDs) is a major challenge for harm reduction programs that include sterile needle/syringe exchange in resource-limited settings like Pakistan. We assessed the risk factors for loss to follow-up among male PWIDs enrolled in a risk reduction program in Karachi, Pakistan., METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study among 636 HIV-uninfected male PWIDs enrolled during March-June 2009 in a harm reduction program for the estimation of incidence rate. At 24 months post-enrollment, clients who had dropped out of the program were defined as lost to follow-up and included as cases for case-cohort study., RESULTS: The median age of the participants was 29 years (interquartile range: 23-36). Active outreach accounted for 76% (483/636) of cohort recruits. Loss to follow-up at 24 months was 25.5% (162/636). In multivariable logistic regression, younger age (AOR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.92-0.99, p = 0.028), clients from other provinces than Sindh (AOR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.01-2.22, p = 0.046), having no formal education (AOR: 3.44, 95% CI: 2.35-4.90, p<0.001), a history of incarceration (AOR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.14-2.46, p<0.008), and being homeless (AOR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.00-2.19, p<0.049) were associated with loss to follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Our cohort retained 74.5% of male PWIDs in Karachi for 24 months. Its loss to follow up rate suggested substantial ongoing programmatic challenges. Programmatic enhancements are needed for the highest risk male PWIDs, i.e., younger men, men not from Sindh Province, men who are poorly educated, formerly incarcerated, and/or homeless.

T1  - Permanent Supportive Housing for Transition-Age Youths: Service Costs and Fidelity to the Housing First Model.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Permanent supportive housing (PSH) programs are being implemented nationally and on a large scale. However, little is known about PSH for transition-age youths (ages 18 to 24). This study estimated health services costs associated with participation in PSH among youths and examined the relationship between fidelity to the Housing First model and health service outcomes., METHODS: Administrative data were used in a quasi-experimental, difference-in-differences design with a propensity score-matched contemporaneous control group to compare health service costs among 2,609 youths in PSH and 2,609 youths with serious mental illness receiving public mental health services in California from January 1, 2004, through June 30, 2010. Data from a survey of PSH program practices were merged with the administrative data to examine changes in service use among 1,299 youths in 63 PSH programs by level of fidelity to the Housing First model., RESULTS: Total service costs increased by $13,337 among youths in PSH compared with youths in the matched control group. Youths in higher-fidelity programs had larger declines in use of inpatient services and larger increases in outpatient visits compared with youths in lower-fidelity programs., CONCLUSIONS: PSH for youths was associated with substantial increases in costs. Higher-fidelity PSH programs may be more effective than lower-fidelity programs in reducing use of inpatient services and increasing use of outpatient services. As substantial investments are made in PSH for youths, it is imperative that these programs are designed and implemented to maximize their effectiveness and their impact on youth outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Intravenous drug users have a high risk of infective endocarditis and reduced survival. Cardiac surgery may be recommended for these patients, but redo surgery is controversial. This study describes the characteristics and outcomes of intravenous drug users accepted for surgery during a 12-year period., METHODS: This retrospective study included 29 injecting drug users treated with valve surgery for endocarditis between January 2001 and December 2013 at a tertiary academic centre. Survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis., RESULTS: The median patient age was 36 (24-63) years and 27 patients (93%) were male. Staphylococcus aureus (52%) and Enterococcus faecalis (17%) were the most common microorganisms. Common illicit drugs were opioids (69%), amphetamines (52%) and benzodiazepines (24%). Mixed abuse was reported in 66% of patients. Seven patients (24%) had prior intracardial implants or native valve pathology. Twenty-five patients (86%) were positive for hepatitis C virus antibody, but none carried the human immunodeficiency virus. Twelve (41%) were homeless and 15 (52%) had poor dental hygiene. Three patients (10%) received medication-assisted rehabilitation before surgery. The main indications for surgery were regurgitation and secondary heart failure (86%), embolization (41%) and uncontrolled infection (24%). Aortic valve replacement was performed in 24 patients (83%), either as part of univalvular or multiple valve surgery. Seven patients (24%) had multivalvular endocarditis. All but 3 patients received biological valve prostheses. The 30-day mortality was 7% after first time surgery. During follow-up, 15 patients (52%) presented with reinfection: 10 (35%) were offered a second and 2 (7%) a third operation. Thirty-day mortality was 10% after redo surgery. Thirteen patients (45%) died within a median of 22 (0-84) months. Continued intravenous drug use was reported in 70 and 44% of patients after the first and second operation, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac surgery for infective endocarditis has acceptable early postoperative results among intravenous drug users. The 2- and 5-year survival were 79 and 59%, respectively. The number of reinfections was high within 2 years, as continued drug use seems to be a major challenge for this group.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Millions of street-connected children and young people worldwide live or work in street environments. They are vulnerable to many risks, whether or not they remain connected to families of origin, and despite many strengths and resiliencies, they are excluded from mainstream social structures and opportunities., OBJECTIVES: Primary research objectivesTo evaluate and summarise the effectiveness of interventions for street-connected children and young people that aim to:* promote inclusion and reintegration;* increase literacy and numeracy;* facilitate access to education and employment;* promote mental health, including self esteem;* reduce harms associated with early sexual activity and substance misuse. Secondary research objectives* To explore whether effects of interventions differ within and between populations, and whether an equity gradient influences these effects, by extrapolating from all findings relevance for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (Peters 2004). * To describe other health, educational, psychosocial and behavioural effects, when appropriate outcomes are reported.* To explore the influence of context in design, delivery and outcomes of interventions.* To explore the relationship between numbers of components and duration and effects of interventions.* To highlight implications of these findings for further research and research methods to improve evidence in relation to the primary research objective.* To consider adverse or unintended outcomes., SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following bibliographic databases, searched for the original review, from inception to 2012, and various relevant non-governmental and organisational websites: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE and Pre-MEDLINE; EMBASE and EMBASE Classic; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); PsycINFO; Education Resource Information Center (ERIC); Sociological Abstracts; Social Services Abstracts; Social Work Abstracts; Healthstar; Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS); System for Grey literature in Europe (OpenGrey); ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; EconLit; IDEAS Economics and Finance Research; JOLIS Library Catalog of the holdings of the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Libraries; British Library for Development Studies (BLDS); Google and Google Scholar. We updated the search in April 2015 for the review update, using the same methods., SELECTION CRITERIA: This review includes data from harm reduction or reintegration intervention studies that used a comparison group study design; all were randomised or quasi-randomised studies. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions provided for street-connected children and young people, from birth to 24 years, in all contexts., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias and other factors presented in the Discussion and Summary quality assessment (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)). We extracted data on intervention delivery, context, process factors, equity and outcomes, and grouped outcomes into psychosocial outcomes, risky sexual behaviours or substance use. We conducted meta-analyses for outcomes where the outcome measures were sufficiently similar. We evaluated other outcomes narratively., MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 studies evaluating 19 interventions from high-income countries (HICs). We found no sufficiently robust evaluations conducted in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Study quality overall was low and measurements used by studies variable. Participants were classified as drop-in and shelter-based. No studies measured the primary outcome of reintegration and none reported on adverse effects. We found no consistent results on a range of relevant outcomes within domains of psychosocial health, substance misuse and sexually risky behaviours . Interventions evaluated consisted of time-limited therapeutically based programmes that proved no more effective than standard shelter or drop-in services and other control interventions used for most outcomes in most studies. Favourable changes from baseline were reported for outcomes for most participants following therapy interventions and standard services. We noted considerable heterogeneity between studies and inconsistent reporting of equity data. No studies measured the primary outcome of reintegration or reported on adverse effects., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Analysis revealed no consistently significant benefit for focused therapeutic interventions compared with standard services such as drop-in centres, case management and other comparable interventions for street-connected children and young people. Commonly available services, however, were not rigorously evaluated. Robust evaluation of interventions, including comparison with no intervention, would establish a more reliable evidence base to inform service implementation. More robust research is needed in LMICs to examine interventions for street-connected children and young people with different backgrounds and service needs.

N2  - Outreach and service linkage are key for engaging marginalized populations, such as homeless youth, in services. Research to date has focused primarily on engaging individuals already receiving some services through emergency shelters, clinics, or other programs. Less is known about those who are not connected to services and, thus, likely the most vulnerable and in need of assistance. The current study sought to engage non-service-connected homeless youth (N = 79) into a strengths-based outreach and advocacy intervention. Youth were randomly assigned to receive 6 months of advocacy that focused on linking youth to a drop-in center (n = 40) or to a crisis shelter (n = 39). All youth were assessed at baseline and 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Findings indicated that youth prefer drop-in center services to the shelter. Also, the drop-in center linkage condition was associated with more service linkage overall (B = 0.34, SE = 0.04, p < 0.01) and better alcohol-l [B = -0.39, SE = 0.09, t(75) = -4.48, p < 0.001] and HIV-related outcomes [B = 0.62, SE = 0.10, t(78) = 6.34, p < 0.001] compared to the shelter linkage condition. Findings highlight the importance of outreach and service linkage for reconnecting service-marginalized youth, and drop-in centers as a primary service option for homeless youth.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Preventing injection drug use among vulnerable youth is critical for reducing serious drug-related harms. Addiction treatment is one evidence-based intervention to decrease problematic substance use; however, youth frequently report being unable to access treatment services and the impact of this on drug use trajectories remains largely unexplored. This study examines the relationship between being unable to access addiction treatment and injection initiation among street-involved youth., METHODS: Data were derived from the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), a prospective cohort of street-involved youth aged 14-26 who use illicit drugs, from September 2005 to May 2014. An extended Cox model with time-dependent variables was used to identify factors independently associated with injection initiation., RESULTS: Among 462 participants who were injection naive at baseline, 97 (21 %) initiated injection drug use over study follow-up and 129 (28 %) reported trying but being unable to access addiction treatment in the previous 6 months at some point during the study period. The most frequently reported reason for being unable to access treatment was being put on a wait list. In a multivariable Cox regression analysis, being unable to access addiction treatment remained independently associated with a more rapid rate of injection initiation (Adjusted Hazard Ratio =2.02; 95 % Confidence Interval: 1.12-3.62), after adjusting for potential confounders., CONCLUSION: Inability to access addiction treatment was common among our sample and associated with injection initiation. Findings highlight the need for easily accessible, evidence-based addiction treatment for high-risk youth as a means to prevent injection initiation and subsequent serious drug-related harms.

N2  - Introduction Bone, native joint and soft tissue infections are frequently referred to orthopaedic units although their volume as a proportion of the total emergency workload has not been reported previously. Geographic and socioeconomic variation may influence their presentation. The aim of this study was to quantify the burden of such infections on the orthopaedic department in an inner city hospital, determine patient demographics and associated risk factors, and review our current utilisation of specialist services. Methods All cases involving bone, native joint and soft tissue infections admitted under or referred to the orthopaedic team throughout 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. Prosthetic joint infections were excluded. Results Almost 15% of emergency admissions and referrals were associated with bone, native joint or soft tissue infection or suspected infection. The cohort consisted of 169 patients with a mean age of 43 years (range: 1-91 years). The most common diagnosis was cellulitis/other soft tissue infection and the mean length of stay was 13 days. Two-thirds of patients (n=112, 66%) underwent an operation. Fifteen per cent of patients were carrying at least one blood borne virus, eleven per cent were alcohol dependent, fifteen per cent were using or had been using intravenous drugs and nine per cent were homeless or vulnerably housed. Conclusions This study has shown that a significant number of patients are admitted for orthopaedic care as a result of infection. These patients are relatively young, with multiple complex medical and social co-morbidities, and a long length of stay.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Millions of families across the world are evicted every year. However, very little is known about the impact that eviction has on their lives. This lack of knowledge is also starting to be noticed within the suicidological literature, and prominent scholars are arguing that there is an urgent need to explore the extent to which suicides may be considered a plausible consequence of being faced with eviction., METHOD: The present study's sample consists of all persons served with an application for execution of an eviction order during 2009-2012. This group is compared to a random 10% sample of the general Swedish population, ages 16 years and over. The analysis is based on penalised maximum likelihood logistic regressions., RESULTS: Those who had lost their legal right to their dwellings and for whom the landlord had applied for the eviction to be executed were approximately four times more likely to commit suicide than those who had not been exposed to this experience (OR=4.42), controlling for several demographic, socioeconomic and mental health conditions prior to the date of the judicial decision., CONCLUSIONS: Home evictions have a significant and detrimental impact on individuals' risk of committing suicide, even when several other well-known suicidogenic risk factors are controlled for. Our results reinforce the importance of ongoing attempts to remove the issue of evictions from its status as a hidden and neglected social problem.

N2  - Eligible adolescents (12-17 years old) were recruited from a short-term crisis shelter for runaway adolescents in a large Midwestern city. Adolescents (N = 179) were randomly assigned to Ecologically-Based Family Therapy (EBFT, n = 61), the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA, n = 57), or brief Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET, n = 61) with the primary focus on substance abuse. A significant increase in perceived family cohesion and a significant reduction in perceived family conflict were found among all treatment conditions from baseline to the 24-month follow-up. Adolescents who received EBFT demonstrated more improvement in family cohesion after treatment than those who received CRA or MET, and more reduction in family conflict during treatment than those who received MET.

N2  - This study reports the mental health outcomes of a small randomized clinical trial (n = 60) that compared housing and supportive services (Ecologically-Based Treatment, EBT) to community based housing and support services (treatment as usual, TAU). Mothers receiving EBT, but not those receiving TAU, reported reductions in their children's behavioral health problems. Reductions in mothers' mental health problems and intimate partner violence were observed in both TAU and EBT. The current findings provide evidence supporting the efficacy of independent housing and integrated support services. Given that EBT showed similar, and in some cases superior findings to TAU, EBT may be an effective alternative for communities that do not have shelters available for those families experiencing homelessness.

N2  - This study was part of a randomized controlled trial designed to improve hepatitis knowledge and health promoting behaviors and subsequently decrease stimulant use and incarceration with 422 (G/B) homeless men between 18 and 46 years of age. Findings revealed that no significant program differences on incarceration in the 4 months following the intervention. However, younger participants (p = .010), and those with prior incarceration (p = .001) were at greater risk for incarceration at 4 months. An additional factor associated with incarceration at 4 months included living on the street for at least 1 week (p = .049).

N2  - BACKGROUND: The most recent statistics indicate that the prevalence of food insecurity in the United States is double that in Canada, but the extent to which the nutrition implications of this problem differ between the countries is not known., OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to compare adequacy of nutrient intakes in relation to household food insecurity among youth and adults in Canada and the United States., METHODS: Data from comparable nationally representative surveys, the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey and the 2003-2006 NHANES, were used to estimate prevalences of inadequate intakes of vitamins A and C, folate, calcium, magnesium, and zinc among youth and adults in food-secure and food-insecure households. Potential differences in the composition of the populations between the 2 countries were addressed by using standardization, and analyses also accounted for participation in food and nutrition assistance programs in the United States., RESULTS: Larger gaps in the prevalences of inadequate intakes between those in food-secure and food-insecure households were observed in Canada than in the United States for calcium and magnesium. For calcium, the prevalences of inadequate intakes among those in food-secure and food-insecure households in Canada were 50% and 66%, respectively, compared with 50% and 51%, respectively, in the United States. For magnesium, the prevalences of inadequate intakes in Canada were 39% and 60% among those in food-secure and food-insecure households, respectively, compared with 60% and 61%, respectively, in the United States. These findings were largely unchanged after we accounted for participation in food and nutrition assistance programs in the United States., CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that household food insecurity is a stronger marker of nutritional vulnerability in Canada than in the United States. The results highlight the need for research to elucidate the effects of domestic policies affecting factors such as food prices and fortification on the nutritional manifestations of food insecurity.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - The study tests the short-term impact on housing stability of the Family Unification Program (FUP), a permanent housing program for child welfare- involved families at risk of separation from children due to inadequate housing. Families eligible for FUP (n = 150) received housing case management services as usual, and half were referred for permanent housing vouchers made available through FUP. Families referred for FUP secured more enriched home learning environments, while more precariously housed families exhibited greater housing, stability when referred for FUP. The intervention did not relate with housing affordability or improvements in neighborhood quality. Findings suggest benefits of FUP-especially for more vulnerable families--in key areas that support child developmet; however, families continue to struggle in the context of poverty.

N2  - This article presents preliminary findings from an impact study that drew upon administrative data collected by city agencies and data collected by a supportive housing program for young adults who are aging out of foster care, homeless, or at risk of homelessness. Participation in the program was associated with a reduction in shelter use and jail stays during the two years after program entry. The study demonstrates the benefits of collaboration and the possibilities of using administrative data from multiple public agencies to evaluate program impacts on young adult outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Identify moderators of treatment outcome from antipsychotic pharmacotherapy in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) trial. Specifically, we used logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to explore the association between baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes in the CATIE trial., METHOD: This is a secondary analysis of the CATIE trial in which 1,460 adults with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia were randomly assigned to olanzapine, perphenazine, quetiapine, risperidone, or ziprasidone treatment for up to 18 months or until discontinuation between January 2001 and December 2004. Logistic regression was used to examine baseline characteristics associated with remission, response, and treatment continuation at 3 and 6 months of treatment. ROC analyses identified subgroups associated with similar likelihood of treatment outcome. Remission was defined by scores of selected items on psychoticism, disorganization, and negative symptoms. Response was defined as a 50% or greater improvement on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale., RESULTS: The most consistent predictors of poor outcome on all variables were low scores on neurocognitive tests (in particular verbal memory) (OR = 1.13-1.49, P< .05); previous reported side effects (OR = 0.49-0.69, P < .05); negative attitude to medication (OR = 1.03-1.10, P < .05); comorbid depression (OR = 0.47-0.51, P < .05); psychosocial factors such as unemployment (OR = 0.74-0.75, P <.05), homelessness (OR = 0.54, P <.05), and living alone (OR = 1.58-1.94, P < .01); and random assignment to a medication other than olanzapine (OR = 1.54-2.04, P < .01). ROC analysis demonstrated prognostic subgroups with large differences in response likelihood., CONCLUSION: Baseline characteristics in schizophrenia are informative regarding clinically important treatment outcomes with respect to antipsychotic pharmacotherapy. Further research should examine whether interventions that target improvement of patients' deficits in neuropsychological function and attitude toward medication as well as decreasing patients' social isolation can improve treatment outcomes with antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00014001. © Copyright 2015 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined veterans' responses to the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA's) universal screen for homelessness and risk of homelessness during the first 12 months of implementation., METHODS: We calculated the baseline annual frequency of homelessness and risk of homelessness among all veterans who completed an initial screen during the study period. We measured changes in housing status among veterans who initially screened positive and then completed a follow-up screen, assessed factors associated with such changes, and identified distinct risk profiles of veterans who completed a follow-up screen., RESULTS: More than 4 million veterans completed an initial screen; 1.8% (n=77,621) screened positive for homelessness or risk of homelessness. Of those who initially screened positive for either homelessness or risk of homelessness and who completed a second screen during the study period, 85.0% (n=15,060) resolved their housing instability prior to their second screen. Age, sex, race, VHA eligibility, and screening location were all associated with changes in housing stability. We identified four distinct risk profiles for veterans with ongoing housing instability., CONCLUSION: To address homelessness among veterans, efforts should include increased and targeted engagement of veterans experiencing persistent housing instability.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patient adherence to medications, particularly for conditions requiring prolonged treatment such as tuberculosis (TB), is frequently less than ideal and can result in poor treatment outcomes. Material incentives to reward good behaviour and enablers to remove economic barriers to accessing care are sometimes given in the form of cash, vouchers, or food to improve adherence., OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of material incentives and enablers in patients undergoing diagnostic testing, or receiving prophylactic or curative therapy, for TB., SEARCH METHODS: We undertook a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; Science Citation Index; and reference lists of relevant publications up to 5 June 2015., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials of material incentives in patients being investigated for TB, or on treatment for latent or active TB., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently screened and selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included trials. We compared the effects of interventions using risk ratios (RR), and presented RRs with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE., MAIN RESULTS: We identified 12 eligible trials. Ten were conducted in the USA: in adolescents (one trial), in injection drug or cocaine users (four trials), in homeless adults (three trials), and in prisoners (two trials). The remaining two trials, in general adult populations, were conducted in Timor-Leste and South Africa. Sustained incentive programmesOnly two trials have assessed whether material incentives and enablers can improve long-term adherence and completion of treatment for active TB, and neither demonstrated a clear benefit (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.14; two trials, 4356 participants; low quality evidence). In one trial, the incentive, given as a daily hot meal, was not well received by the population due to the inconvenience of attending the clinic at midday, whilst in the other trial, nurses distributing the vouchers chose to "ration" their distribution among eligible patients, giving only to those whom they felt were most deprived.Three trials assessed the effects of material incentives and enablers on completion of TB prophylaxis with mixed results (low quality evidence). A large effect was seen with regular cash incentives given to drug users at each clinic visit in a setting with extremely low treatment completion in the control group (treatment completion 52.8% intervention versus 3.6% control; RR 14.53, 95% CI 3.64 to 57.98; one trial, 108 participants), but no effects were seen in one trial assessing a cash incentive for recently released prisoners (373 participants), or another trial assessing material incentives offered by parents to teenagers (388 participants). Single once-only incentivesHowever in specific populations, such as recently released prisoners, drug users, and the homeless, trials show that material incentives probably do improve one-off clinic re-attendance for initiation or continuation of anti-TB prophylaxis (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.96; three trials, 595 participants; moderate quality evidence), and may increase the return rate for reading of tuberculin skin test results (RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.29; two trials, 1371 participants; low quality evidence). Comparison of different types of incentivesSingle trials in specific sub-populations suggest that an immediate cash incentive may be more effective than delaying the incentive until completion of treatment (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.24; one trial, 300 participants; low quality evidence), cash incentives may be more effective than non-cash incentives (completion of TB prophylaxis: RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.56; one trial, 141 participants; low quality evidence; return for skin test reading: RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.19; one trial, 652 participants; low quality evidence); and higher cash incentives may be more effective than lower cash incentives (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.16; one trial, 404 participants; low quality evidence)., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Material incentives and enablers may have some positive short term effects on clinic attendance, particularly for marginal populations such as drug users, recently released prisoners, and the homeless, but there is currently insufficient evidence to know if they can improve long term adherence to TB treatment.

N2  - We describe data from a multi-center community-based survey of homeless veterans who were not accessing available primary care to identify reasons for not getting this care as well as for not seeking health care when it was needed. Overall, 185 homeless veterans were interviewed: The average age was 48.7 years (SD 10.8), 94.6% were male, 43.2% were from a minority population. The majority identified a recent need for care and interest in having a primary care provider. Reasons for delaying care fell into three domains: 1) trust; 2) stigma; and 3) care processes. Identifying a place for care (OR 3.3; 95% CI: 1.4-7.7), having a medical condition (OR 5.5; 95% CI 1.9-15.4) and having depression (OR 3.4; 95% CI: 1.4-8.7) were associated with receiving care while not being involved in care decisions was associated with no care (OR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5-0.9). Our findings support the importance of considering health access within an expanded framework that includes perceived stigma, inflexible care systems and trust issues.

N2  - A randomized trial compared effects of a Family Critical Time Intervention (FCTI) to usual care for children in 200 newly homeless families in which mothers had diagnosable mental illness or substance problems. Adapted from an evidence-based practice to prevent chronic homelessness for adults with mental illnesses, FCTI combines housing and structured, time-limited case management to connect families leaving shelter with community services. Families were followed at five time points over 24 months. Data on 311 children-99 ages 1.5-5 years, 113 ages 6-10 years, and 99 ages 11-16 years-included mother-, teacher-, and child-reports of mental health, school experiences, and psychosocial well-being. Analyses used hierarchical linear modeling to investigate intervention effects and changes in child functioning over time. Referral to FCTI reduced internalizing and externalizing problems in preschool-aged children and externalizing for adolescents 11-16. The intervention led to declines in self-reported school troubles for children 6-10 and 11-16. Both experimental and control children in all age groups showed reductions in symptoms over time. Although experimental results were scattered, they suggest that FCTI has the potential to improve mental health and school outcomes for children experiencing homelessness.

N2  - This article outlines the main premises of an innovative trauma-informed intervention, group attachment-based intervention, specifically developed to target vulnerable families with infants and toddlers, living in one of the poorest urban counties in the nation. It also reports on the trauma-relevant characteristics of 60 families entering a clinical trial to study the effectiveness of Group Attachment-Based Intervention. Initial survey results revealed high levels of neglect, abuse, and household dysfunction in mothers' histories (77% reported >=4 adverse childhood experiences, with more than 90% reporting 2 or more current toxic stressors, including poverty, obesity, domestic and community violence, and homelessness).

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Goals for this study were to characterize the substances being used by youth who presented to an emergency department (ED), their demographic descriptors, and to describe the associated acute morbidity and mortality., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all youth, ages 10-16 years, who presented to a pediatric ED with complaints related to recreational drug use (n=641) for 2 years ending on December 31, 2009., RESULTS: The median age of patients was 15 years; 56% were female. Six percent of patients were homeless, and 21% were wards of the state. The most frequent ingestions included ethanol (74%), marijuana (20%), ecstasy (19%), and medications (15%). Over one third of patients had ingested two or more substances. Ninety percent of patients were brought to the ED by the emergency medical services; 63% of these activations were by non-acquaintances. Of the 47% of youth who presented with a decreased level of consciousness, half had a Glasgow Coma Scale less than 13. The Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale score was 1 or 2 for 44% of patients. Sixty-eight percent received IV fluids, 42% received medication, and 4% were intubated. The admission rate was 9%., CONCLUSIONS: Youth who presented to the ED for substance use represented a socially vulnerable population whose use of recreational substances resulted in high medical acuity and significant morbidity. Improved clinical identification of such high-risk youth and subsequent design of interventions to address problematic substance use and social issues are urgently needed to complement the acute medical care that youth receive.

T1  - Home for now: A mixed-methods evaluation of a short-term housing support program for homeless families.

N2  - The use of short-term rental subsidy vouchers offers a new approach to addressing the housing needs of families facing homelessness. In Massachusetts, the Family Home pilot program placed homeless families in housing instead of shelter, providing two years of rental subsidy plus support services with the goal of enabling families to maintain market rate housing. This mixed-method case study complements staff and participant interview data with participant survey and administrative data to evaluate the implementation and short-term outcomes of Family Home in one region. Data point to improved family well-being in housing but also persistent barriers to achieving longer-term housing and economic stability. Of the families who had exited the program at the end of the study, one quarter were able to retain their housing at market rate, only 9% returned to shelter, and one in five moved in with families/friends. Lack of affordable housing in a high rental cost region and jobs that pay living wages were among the major reasons that families struggled to maintain housing. This research points to the need for integrating supportive services from the program's start, including targeted workforce development, to plan for the end of the short-term rental subsidy.

N2  - This study examined gender differences among homeless young adults' coping strategies and homelessness stressors as they relate to legal (e.g., full-time employment, selling personal possessions, selling blood/plasma) and illegal economic activity (e.g., selling drugs, theft, prostitution). A sample of 601 homeless young adults was recruited from 3 cities (Los Angeles, CA [n = 200], Austin, TX [n = 200], and Denver, CO [n = 201]) to participate in semi-structured interviews from March 2010 to July 2011. Risk and resilience correlates of legal and illegal economic activity were analyzed using six Ordinary Least Squares regression models with the full sample and with the female and male sub-samples. In the full sample, three variables (i.e., avoidant coping, problem-focused coping, and mania) were associated with legal income generation whereas eight variables (i.e., social coping, age, arrest history, transience, peer substance use, antisocial personality disorder [ASPD], substance use disorder [SUD], and major depressive episode [MDE]) were associated with illegal economic activity. In the female sub-sample, three variables (i.e., problem-focused coping, race/ethnicity, and transience) were correlated with legal income generation whereas six variables (i.e., problem-focused coping, social coping, age, arrest history, peer substance use, and ASPD) were correlated with illegal economic activity. Among males, the model depicting legal income generation was not significant yet seven variables (i.e., social coping, age, transience, peer substance use, ASPD, SUD, and MDE) were associated with illegal economic activity. Understanding gender differences in coping strategies and economic activity might help customize interventions aimed at safe and legal income generation for this population.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death among homeless people. This study examines CVD risk factors and 30-year CVD risk in a population of homeless individuals with mental illness., METHODS: CVD risks factors were assessed in 352 homeless individuals with mental illness in Toronto, Canada, at the time of their enrollment in the At Home/Chez Soi Project, a randomized trial of a Housing First intervention. The 30-year risk for CVD (coronary death, myocardial infarction, and fatal or nonfatal stroke) was calculated using published formulas and examined for association with need for mental health services, diagnosis of psychotic disorder, sex, ethnicity, access to a family physician and diagnosis of substance dependence., RESULTS: The 30-year CVD risk for study participants was 24.5 +/- 18.4%, more than double the reference normal of 10.1 +/- 7.21% (difference = -13.0% 95% CI -16.5% to -9.48%). Univariate analyses revealed 30-year CVD risk was greater among males (OR 3.99, 95% CI 2.47 to 6.56) and those who were diagnosed with substance dependence at baseline (OR 1.94 95% CI 1.23 to 3.06) and reduced among those who were non-white (OR 0.62 95% CI 0.39 to 0.97). In adjusted analyses, only male sex (OR 4.71 95% CI 2.76 to 8.05) and diagnosis of substance dependence (OR 1.78 95% CI 1.05 to 3.00) remained associated with increased CVD risk., CONCLUSIONS: Homeless people with mental illness have highly elevated 30-year CVD risk, particularly among males and those diagnosed with substance dependence. This study adds to the literature by reporting on CVD risk in a particularly vulnerable population of homeless individuals experiencing mental illness, and by using a 30-year CVD risk calculator which provides a longer time-frame during which the effect of modifiable CVD risk factors could be mitigated., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN42520374.

This study examines the relationship between foster care placement as a predictor of adult substance use disorders (including frequency, severity and type), mental illness, vocational functioning, service use and duration of homelessness among a sample of homeless adults with mental illness. We hypothesize that a history of foster care predicts earlier, more severe and more frequent substance use, multiple mental disorder diagnoses, discontinuous work history, and longer durations of homelessness., METHODS: This study was conducted using baseline data from two randomized controlled trials in Vancouver, British Columbia for participants who responded to a series of questions pertaining to out-of-home care at 12 months follow-up (n = 442). Primary outcomes included current mental disorders; substance use including type, frequency and severity; physical health; duration of homelessness; vocational functioning; and service use., RESULTS: In multivariable regression models, a history of foster care placement independently predicted incomplete high school, duration of homelessness, discontinuous work history, less severe types of mental illness, multiple mental disorders, early initiation of drug and/or alcohol use, and daily drug use., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first Canadian study to investigate the relationship between a history of foster care and current substance use among homeless adults with mental illness, controlling for several other potential confounding factors. It is important to screen homeless youth who exit foster care for substance use, and to provide integrated treatment for concurrent disorders to homeless youth and adults who have both psychiatric and substance use problems., TRIALS REGISTRATION NUMBERS: Both trials are registered with the International Standard Randomized Control Trial Number Register and were assigned ISRCTN57595077 (Vancouver At Home Study: Housing First plus assertive community treatment versus congregate housing plus supports versus treatment as usual) and ISRCTN66721740 (Vancouver At Home Study: Housing First plus intensive case management versus treatment as usual) on September 9, 2012.

N2  - This article reports 2-year outcomes from a cluster randomized, controlled trial of the Early Risers (ER) program implemented as a selective preventive intervention in supportive housing settings for homeless families. Based on the goals of this comprehensive prevention program, we predicted that intervention participants receiving ER services would show improvement in parenting and child outcomes relative to families in treatment-as-usual sites. The sample included 270 children in 161 families, residing in 15 supportive housing sites; multimethod, multi-informant assessments conducted at baseline and yearly thereafter included parent and teacher report of child adjustment, parent report of parenting self-efficacy, and parent-child observations that yielded scores of effective parenting practices. Data were modeled in HLM7 (4-level model accounting for nesting of children within families and families within housing sites). Two years' postbaseline, intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses indicated that parents in the ER group showed significantly improved parenting self-efficacy, and parent report indicated significant reductions in ER group children's depression. No main effects of ITT were shown for observed parenting effectiveness. However, over time, average levels of parenting self-efficacy predicted observed effective parenting practices, and observed effective parenting practices predicted improvements in both teacher- and parent-report of child adjustment. This is the first study to our knowledge to demonstrate prevention effects of a program for homeless families residing in family supportive housing. Copyright (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

T1  - Can exploring natural recovery from substance misuse in psychosis assist with treatment? A review of current research.

N2  - Substance misuse in people with psychosis presents significant problems, but trials of treatments to address it show little sustained advantage over control conditions. An examination of mechanisms underpinning unassisted improvements may assist in the refinement of comorbidity treatments. This study reviewed existing research on natural recovery from substance misuse in people with psychosis. To address this issue, a systematic search identified only 7 articles that fulfilled the criteria. Their results suggest that people with psychosis report similar reasons to change as do non-psychotic groups, although they did not clarify whether the relative frequencies or priority orders were the same. Differences involved issues relating to the disorder and the functional problems faced by this group: receipt of treatment for mental health difficulties, worsening of mental health difficulties, and homelessness. The current research on reasons for change in people with psychosis is sparse and has significant limitations, and as yet it offers little inspiration for new treatments. A more fertile source may prove to be a detailed investigation of successful substance control strategies that are used in self-management by this group. Crown Copyright © 2015.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate of the concordance between the results of the tuberculin skin test (TST) and an interferon-gamma release assay (QuantiFERON test, QFT-GIT) for diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in homeless people in Tehran city, Iran., METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from June to August 2012. Homeless people were eligible to participate in the study if they were 18-60 years old., RESULTS: Among 569 homeless people, 46.22% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 42.16-50.33%) and 20.39% (95% CI = 17.28-23.9%) were QFT-GIT and TST positive, respectively. Among these participants, the prevalence of LTBI with positivity of at least one of the tests was 52.2%. The overall agreement between QFT-GIT and TST was 62.21% (kappa = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.13-0.29, p < 0.001). Factors associated with positive results in QFT-GIT and TST were older age, being male, having a longer history of homelessness and having a history of incarceration in the last 10 years., CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of LTBI was seen among homeless people in this study. There was a poor concordance between QFT-GIT and TST among this group. To better assess the utility of QFT-GIT in detection of LTBI further studies with a low prevalence of LTBI in this group are recommended.

N2  - The current study compared offender and offense characteristics of pretrial defendants found incompetent to stand trial (IST) against those described as general offenders by victims in the 2008 Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) survey and evaluated factors that differentiated IST defendants who allegedly used weapons from those who did not during the course of a violent offense. IST defendants were older and used "weapons" more frequently than those reported in the BJS survey; however, other characteristics, including use of firearms, did not differ. No demographic, clinical, or legal factors differentiated pretrial defendants who used weapons from those who did not. Overall, pretrial defendants were frequently diagnosed with a comorbid substance use disorder, and were homeless, unemployed, and had an extensive history of psychiatric hospitalizations and prior arrests at the time of their alleged offenses. Such results indicate that models for comprehensive discharge planning may have utility in addressing the unique needs of this subgroup of mentally disordered offenders. The findings also raise questions about the federal and state prohibition of gun rights to all IST defendants. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Case management, a widely practiced form of service brokerage, is associated with a variety of positive outcomes for homeless youth, but it may be difficult to implement, as youth face logistical barriers to attending in-person meetings. As part of a larger clinical trial, the current study investigates the feasibility of providing electronic case management (ECM) to homeless youth, using cell-phones, texts, email, and Facebook. Youth were given prepaid cell-phones and a case manager who provided four ECM sessions every 2-3 weeks over a 3-month period. Contact logs were used to record how many youth engaged in ECM, how many attempts were necessary to elicit engagement, and youths' preferred technology methods for engaging. Although engagement in the number of ECM sessions varied, the majority of youth (87.5%) engaged in at least one ECM session. Youth (41%) most commonly needed one contact before they engaged in an ECM session, and the majority responded by the third attempt. While youth most commonly answered calls directly, their chosen method of returning calls was texting. The majority of youth (80%) described ECM positively, reporting themes of convenience, connection, and accountability. The use of ECM, particularly of texting, offers promising implications for providing services to homeless youth. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - While research on homeless adolescents and young adults evidencing substance use disorder is increasing, there is a dearth of information regarding effective interventions, and more research is needed to guide those who serve this population. The current study builds upon prior research showing promising findings of the community reinforcement approach (CRA) (Slesnick, Prestopnik, Meyers, & Glassman, 2007). Homeless adolescents and young adults between the ages of 14 to 20 years were randomized to one of three theoretically distinct interventions: (1) CRA (n = 93), (2) motivational enhancement therapy (MET, n = 86), or (3) case management (CM, n = 91). The relative effectiveness of these interventions was evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months post-baseline. Findings indicated that substance use and associated problems were significantly reduced in all three interventions across time. Several moderating effects were found, especially for sex and history of childhood abuse. Findings show little evidence of superiority or inferiority of the three interventions and suggest that drop-in centers have choices for addressing the range of problems that these adolescents and young adults face.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The negative health effects of cigarette smoking and HIV infection are synergistic., OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of current cigarette smoking and smoking cessation between adults with HIV receiving medical care and adults in the general population., DESIGN: Nationally representative cross-sectional surveys., SETTING: United States., PATIENTS: 4217 adults with HIV who participated in the Medical Monitoring Project and 27 731 U.S. adults who participated in the National Health Interview Survey in 2009., MEASUREMENTS: The main exposure was cigarette smoking. The outcome measures were weighted prevalence of cigarette smoking and quit ratio (ratio of former smokers to the sum of former and current smokers)., RESULTS: Of the estimated 419 945 adults with HIV receiving medical care, 42.4% (95% CI, 39.7% to 45.1%) were current cigarette smokers, 20.3% (CI, 18.6% to 22.1%) were former smokers, and 37.3% (CI, 34.9% to 39.6%) had never smoked. Compared with the U.S. adult population, in which an estimated 20.6% of adults smoked cigarettes in 2009, adults with HIV were nearly twice as likely to smoke (adjusted prevalence difference, 17.0 percentage points [CI, 14.0 to 20.1 percentage points]) but were less likely to quit smoking (quit ratio, 32.4% vs. 51.7%). Among adults with HIV, factors independently associated with greater smoking prevalence were older age, non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black race, lower educational level, poverty, homelessness, incarceration, substance use, binge alcohol use, depression, and not achieving a suppressed HIV viral load., LIMITATION: Cross-sectional design with some generalizability limitations., CONCLUSION: Adults with HIV were more likely to smoke and less likely to quit smoking than the general adult population. Tobacco screening and cessation strategies are important considerations as part of routine HIV care.

N2  - PURPOSE: In this study, we report prevalence rates of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and Axis I psychiatric and substance use disorders among randomly selected women who were experiencing episodes of homelessness in three US cities., METHODS: The sample consists of 156 women, 79 from Omaha, NE, 39 from Pittsburgh, PA, and 38 from Portland, OR. It included 140 women from shelters and 16 women from meal locations. Latent class analysis was used to evaluate BPD symptoms., RESULTS: A large majority of the women (84.6 %) met criteria for at least one lifetime psychiatric disorder, about three-fourths (73.1 %) met criteria for a psychiatric disorder in the past year, and 39.7 % met past month criteria for a psychiatric disorder. Approximately three-fourths of the sample (73.7 %) met lifetime criteria for at least two disorders, about half (53.9 %) met criteria for at least three lifetime disorders, and approximately one-third (39.1 %) met criteria for four or more disorders. Latent class analyses indicated that 16.7 % of the women could be categorized as low self-harm BPD and 19.9 % high self-harm BPD., CONCLUSIONS: In shelters and in treatment settings, these women will present with complex histories of multiple serious psychiatric disorders. They are highly likely to manifest symptoms of BPD, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse disorders in addition to other psychiatric symptoms which will add to clinical complications.

N2  - We studied a cohort of 15,620 adults who had experienced at least 1 jail incarceration and 1 homeless shelter stay in 2001-2003 in New York City to identify trajectories of these events and tested whether a particular trajectory was associated with all-cause, drug-related, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related mortality risk in 2004-2005. Using matched data on jail time, homeless shelter stays, and vital statistics, we performed sequence analysis and assessed mortality risk using standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and marginal structural modeling. We identified 6 trajectories. Sixty percent of the cohort members had a temporary pattern, which was characterized by sporadic experiences of brief incarceration and homelessness, whereas the rest had the other 5 patterns, which reflected experiences of increasing, decreasing, or persistent jail or shelter stays. Mortality risk among individuals with a temporary pattern was significantly higher than those of adults who had not been incarcerated or stayed in a homeless shelter during the study period (all-cause SMR: 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14, 1.59; drug-related SMR: 4.60, 95% CI: 3.17, 6.46; HIV-related SMR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.21); all-cause and HIV-related SMRs in other patterns were not statistically significantly different. When we compared all 6 trajectories, the temporary pattern was more strongly associated with higher mortality risk than was the continuously homelessness pattern. Institutional interventions to reduce recurrent cycles of incarceration and homelessness are needed to augment behavioral interventions to reduce mortality risk. Copyright © The Author 2015.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study estimates HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Jamaica and explores social determinants of HIV infection among MSM., DESIGN: An island-wide cross-sectional survey of MSM recruited by peer referral and outreach was conducted in 2011. A structured questionnaire was administered and HIV/STI tests done. We compared three groups: MSM who accepted cash for sex within the past 3 months (MSM SW), MSM who did not accept cash for sex (MSM non-SW), and MSM with adverse life events (ever raped, jailed, homeless, victim of violence or low literacy)., RESULTS: HIV prevalence among 449 MSM was 31.4%, MSM SW 41.1%, MSM with adverse life events 38.5%, 17 transgender MSM (52.9%), and MSM non-SW without adverse events 21.0%. HIV prevalence increased with age and number of adverse life events (test for trend P < 0.001), as did STI prevalence (P = 0.03). HIV incidence was 6.7 cases/100 person-years (95% CI: 3.74, 12.19). HIV prevalence was highest among MSM reporting high-risk sex; MSM SW who had been raped (65.0%), had a STI (61.2%) and who self identified as female (55.6%). Significant risk factors for HIV infection common to all 3 subgroups were participation in both receptive and insertive anal intercourse, high-risk sex, and history of a STI. Perception of no or little risk, always using a condom, and being bisexual were protective., CONCLUSION: HIV prevalence was high among MSM SW and MSM with adverse life events. Given the characteristics of the sample, HIV prevalence among MSM in Jamaica is probably in the range of 20%. The study illustrates the importance of social vulnerability in driving the HIV epidemic. Programs to empower young MSM, reduce social vulnerability and other structural barriers including stigma and discrimination against MSM are critical to reduce HIV transmission.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: In a cluster randomized controlled trial, this study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of and fidelity to Houvast (Dutch for "grip"), a strengths-based intervention to improve the quality of life for homeless young adults., METHODS: Fidelity was measured six months after professionals and team leaders at five Dutch shelters for homeless young adults finished their training in Houvast. Fidelity was measured with the Dutch version of the strengths model fidelity scale, which consists of ten indicators distributed across three subscales: structure, supervision, and clinical practice. A total fidelity score was composed by averaging the ten indicator scores for each facility. During one-day audits by two trained assessors visiting each facility, a file analysis (N=46), a focus group with homeless young adults (N=19), and interviews with the team leader and supervisor (N=9) were conducted. Professionals, supervisors, and team leaders completed questionnaires two weeks before the audit (N=43). In addition, an evaluation of the audit was conducted six months later., RESULTS: Although none of the five shelters achieved a sufficient total model fidelity score, median scores on caseload, group supervision, and strengths assessment were satisfactory. Each facility received a report with a set of recommendations to improve model fidelity. The evaluation showed improvements in use of the strengths assessment and personal recovery plans and in supervision., CONCLUSIONS: Facilities face several challenges when implementing a new intervention, and implementing Houvast was no exception. Learning experiences and possible explanations for the insufficient total fidelity scores are reported.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the HIV risk behaviours of men who have sex with men only (MSMO) and men who have sex with men and women (MSMW), aged 12-24 years, in five US cities and in San Juan, Puerto Rico., METHODS: Data were collected through four annual cross-sectional anonymous surveys at community venues and included questions about sexual partnerships, sexual practices including condom use and substance use. Demographic and risk profiles were summarised for both groups., RESULTS: A total of 1198 men were included in this analysis, including 565 MSMO and 633 MSMW. There were statistically significant differences between the two groups for many risk factors examined in multivariable models. MSMW were more likely to identify as bisexual, be in a long-term relationship, have a history of homelessness, have ever used marijuana, have ever been tested for HIV and to have been tested for HIV within the past 6 months. MSMW may be more likely to ever exchange sex for money and ever have a sexually transmitted infection than MSMO., CONCLUSIONS: MSMW were more likely to report several markers of socioeconomic vulnerability or behaviours associated with increased risk for HIV than MSMO. MSMW contribute to HIV prevalence in the USA, and better understanding of the risk profile of this group is essential to understand heterosexual HIV transmission. MSMW, particularly those who identify as bisexual or questioning, may feel uncomfortable participating in programmes that are designed for gay-identified men. Therefore, prevention strategies need to target distinct subgroups that compose the population of MSM. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Despite having multiple risk factors, women experiencing homelessness are screened for cervical cancer at a lower rate than women in the general US population. We report on the design of a stated preference study to assess homeless women's preferences for cervical cancer screening interventions, to inform efforts to overcome this disparity., METHODS: We conducted focus groups with homeless women (n = 8) on cervical cancer screening decisions and analyzed the data using thematic analysis. We applied inclusion criteria to select factors for a stated preference survey: importance to women, relevance to providers, feasibility, and consistency with clinical experience. We conducted pretests (n = 35) to assess survey procedures (functionality, recruitment, administration) and content (understanding, comprehension, wording/language, length)., RESULTS: We chose best-worst scaling (BWS)-also known as object scaling-to identify decision-relevant screening intervention factors. We chose an experimental design with 11 "objects" (i.e., factors relevant to women's screening decision) presented in 11 subsets of five objects each. Of 25 objects initially identified, we selected 11 for the BWS instrument: provider-related factors: attitude, familiarity, and gender; setting-related factors: acceptance and cost; procedure-related factors: explanation during visit and timing/convenience of visit; personal fears and barriers: concerns about hygiene, addiction, and delivery/fear of results; and a general factor of feeling overwhelmed., CONCLUSION: Good practices for the development of stated preference surveys include considered assessment of the experimental design that is used and the preference factors that are included, and pretesting of the presentation format. We demonstrate the development of a BWS study of homeless women's cervical cancer screening intervention preferences. Subsequent research will identify screening priorities to inform intervention design.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a clinic-based screening and referral system (Well Child Care, Evaluation, Community Resources, Advocacy, Referral, Education [WE CARE]) on families' receipt of community-based resources for unmet basic needs., METHODS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial at 8 urban community health centers, recruiting mothers of healthy infants. In the 4 WE CARE clinics, mothers completed a self-report screening instrument that assessed needs for child care, education, employment, food security, household heat, and housing. Providers made referrals for families; staff provided requisite applications and telephoned referred mothers within 1 month. Families at the 4 control community health centers received the usual care. We analyzed the results with generalized mixed-effect models., RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-six mothers were enrolled in the study (168 per arm). The majority of families had household incomes <$20,000 (57%), and 68% had >= 2 unmet basic needs. More WE CARE mothers received >= 1 referral at the index visit (70% vs 8%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 29.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 14.7-59.6). At the 12-month visit, more WE CARE mothers had enrolled in a new community resource (39% vs 24%; aOR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.7). WE CARE mothers had greater odds of being employed (aOR = 44.4; 95% CI, 9.8-201.4). WE CARE children had greater odds of being in child care (aOR = 6.3; 95% CI, 1.5-26.0). WE CARE families had greater odds of receiving fuel assistance (aOR = 11.9; 95% CI, 1.7-82.9) and lower odds of being in a homeless shelter (aOR = 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9)., CONCLUSIONS: Systematically screening and referring for social determinants during well child care can lead to the receipt of more community resources for families.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Post-visit "booster" sessions have been recommended to augment the impact of brief interventions delivered in the emergency department (ED). This paper, which focuses on implementation issues, presents descriptive information and interventionists' qualitative perspectives on providing brief interventions over the phone, challenges, "lessons learned", and recommendations for others attempting to implement adjunctive booster calls., METHOD: Attempts were made to complete two 20-minute telephone "booster" calls within a week following a patient's ED discharge with 425 patients who screened positive for and had recent problematic substance use other than alcohol or nicotine., RESULTS: Over half (56.2%) of participants completed the initial call; 66.9% of those who received the initial call also completed the second call. Median number of attempts to successfully contact participants for the first and second calls were 4 and 3, respectively. Each completed call lasted an average of about 22 minutes. Common challenges/barriers identified by booster callers included unstable housing, limited phone access, unavailability due to additional treatment, lack of compensation for booster calls, and booster calls coming from an area code different than the participants' locale and from someone other than ED staff., CONCLUSIONS: Specific recommendations are presented with respect to implementing a successful centralized adjunctive booster call system. Future use of booster calls might be informed by research on contingency management (e.g., incentivizing call completions), smoking cessation quitlines, and phone-based continuing care for substance abuse patients. Future research needs to evaluate the incremental benefit of adjunctive booster calls on outcomes over and above that of brief motivational interventions delivered in the ED setting.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: To describe the occurrence of non-regular attendance to follow-up visits among HIV patients and to analyze the determining factors., METHODS: One-day survey carried out annually (2002-2012) in public hospitals. Epidemiological, clinical and behavioral data are collected in all HIV-infected inpatients and outpatients receiving HIV-related care on the day of the survey. "Non-regular attendance to a follow-up visit" was defined as sporadic attendance to the medical appointments, according to the judgment of the attending physician. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were performed, and factors associated to non-regular attendance to follow-up visits were estimated using logistic regression., RESULTS: A total of 7,304 subjects were included, of whom 13.7% did not attend medical appointments regularly. Factors directly associated with non-regular attendance were: age between 25-49 years; birth in Sub-Saharan Africa or Latin-America; low educational level; being homeless or in prison; living alone or in closed institutions; being unemployed or retired; being an intravenous drug user; not using a condom at last sexual encounter, and injecting drugs in the last 30 days. Conversely, HIV diagnosis within the last year and being men who have sex with men were factors inversely associated with non-regular attendance to follow-up visits., CONCLUSION: In spite of health care beings free of charge for everyone in Spain, social factors can act as barriers to regular attendance to medical appointments, which, in turn, can endanger treatment effectiveness in some population groups. This should be taken into account when planning HIV policies in Spain. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. y Sociedad Espanola de Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiologia Clinica.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study examines key themes from narrative interviews conducted with 43 homeless adults with mental disorders 18 months after random assignment to Housing First with intensive supports or to treatment as usual (no housing or supports through the study)., METHOD: Coding and thematic analysis of semistructured interviews was based on 2 research questions from participants' perspectives: (a) What changes were perceived over time? (b) What factors facilitated or hindered change?, RESULTS: The majority of participants assigned to Housing First reported positive change across multiple domains as a result of stable housing; whereas the majority of treatment as usual participants reported negative or neutral change. Key themes included feelings of security and pride; adjusting to living alone; housing as a learning process; and developing meaningful activity. The sense of security associated with stable housing was the most influential factor that supported change. Factors that helped or hindered change clustered into 4 key themes: the type and quality of services; the cumulative effects of trauma; social ties; and concurrent substance use., CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our findings provide important context to the emerging body of quantitative research on Housing First and recovery from homelessness. Participants ' experiences of recovery, particularly as it relates to housing and supports, shifts in identity, and meaningful activity must be acknowledged and incorporated into the design and evaluation of public services, and policy and service reforms.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Homeless people have a 3-5-fold increased risk of mortality compared with general populations. After 2005, policy actions being implemented in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, have improved the living conditions of this group. This study examines the effect of policies aimed at improving living conditions on mortality risks of the homeless., METHODS: Register-based 10-year follow-up study of homeless in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The participants are homeless adults (aged 18+ years) who visited one or more services for homeless people in Rotterdam in 2001. The intervention of local policies after 2005 was to get homeless people into housing, increase their participation in employment and other regular daytime activities, and controlling drug and alcohol addictions. The main outcome measure is mortality rate ratios calculated using Poisson regression. Differences in mortality between the periods 2001-05 vs. 2006-10 were assessed., RESULTS: The cohort of homeless adults in 2001 consisted of 1870 men and 260 women, with a mean age of 40.3 years. During the 10 years of follow-up, 265 persons (232 male and 33 female) died. Adjusted for age and sex, no significant difference in mortality was observed between the periods 2001-05 and 2006-10 (P = 0.9683). A different splitting in periods did not change the results., CONCLUSION: Five years of local policy efforts improved their living conditions, but left the mortality rate of a homeless cohort unchanged. Incomplete reach of the program and long previous histories of homelessness ask for additional policies beyond the provision of housing and other services. Attention to the prevention of homelessness seems needed. Copyright © The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Public Health Association. All rights reserved.

N2  - The high prevalence of rape and sexual trauma symptomatology among women involved in street-based sex trades is well-established. Because prior research has lacked appropriate, non-sex trade involved comparison groups, it is unknown whether differences exist among similarly situated women who do and do not trade sex. This article explores experiences of childhood and adult rape and symptomatology of sexual abuse trauma among a community-based sample of 322 women who use methamphetamine in San Francisco, California, 61% of whom were involved in the sex trade. Study participants were recruited via respondent-driven sampling and eligible if they were cisgender women, aged 18 or older, current methamphetamine users, and sexually active with at least one cisgender man in the past 6 months. The dependent variable was sexual abuse trauma symptomatology, as measured by the Sexual Abuse Trauma Index (SATI) subscale of the Trauma Symptom Checklist-40 (TSC-40), and the explanatory variable was sex trade involvement. Potential covariates were age, current homelessness, methamphetamine dependence, and experiences of childhood and adult rape. Sixty-one percent of participants had a SATI subscale score suggestive of sexual abuse trauma. The overall prevalence of rape in childhood and adulthood was 52% and 73%, respectively. In bivariate analysis, sex trade involvement and all of the potential covariates except for homelessness and age were associated with a SATI score suggestive of sexual abuse trauma. In multivariate models controlling for significant covariates, there was no longer a statistically significant association between sex trade involvement or childhood rape and an elevated SATI score. Elevated levels of psychological dependence on methamphetamine and experiences of rape as an adult were still associated with a high SATI score. These findings highlight that urban poor women, regardless of sex trade involvement, suffer high levels of rape and related trauma symptomatology. Copyright © The Author(s) 2014.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: This paper examined whether recall of childhood trauma was associated with adult alcohol consumption in a sample of Australians with low housing security. The secondary aim was to examine whether risky alcohol consumption predicted subsequent housing instability. Sociodemographic factors were examined as potential moderators of these associations., DESIGN AND METHODS: This paper utilised data collected through the Journeys Home Study, a longitudinal study of a representative sample of individuals who were homeless or at risk of homelessness. This paper focused on 1224 participants aged 18 years and over. Data on alcohol use, childhood trauma and sociodemographic characteristics were collected through interviews at baseline. Homeless status at 6- to 12-month follow-up was assessed via interview. Logistic regression modelling was used to examine associations of alcohol consumption with childhood abuse, sociodemographic factors and changes in homelessness status., RESULTS: Self-reported recall of childhood experiences of violence was more likely among current drinkers, risky or not, than among abstainers. Recall of childhood neglect was more common among abstainers than among risky drinkers., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The relationships between recall of childhood trauma and adult alcohol consumption are likely to be complex. Risky consumption may contribute to continuing homelessness among adults with unstable housing.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Homeless young people represent one of the most vulnerable and underserved populations., OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of psychiatric disorder and comorbidity among a UK sample, and examine the longitudinal relationship between psychiatric conditions and different types of health service use., METHODS: 90 young people with experiences of homelessness were interviewed using a full psychiatric assessment. Participants were followed up 8-12 months later and completed an interview that included information about recent health service use (mental health, emergency room, general practitioner, hospital for physical problems, drug or alcohol services)., FINDINGS: The prevalence of psychiatric disorder (88% current; 93% lifetime) and psychiatric comorbidity (73%) was high and that of mental health service use low in comparison (31%). Mood disorders, psychosis and suicide risk were significantly associated with mental health service use (OR 5.21, 95% CI 1.64 to 16.58; OR 10.0, CI 1.58 to 94.58; OR 6.25, CI 1.82 to 21.43, respectively). Emergency department use was predicted by mood disorders (OR 5.19, CI 1.68 to 16.0), psychosis (OR 7.33, CI 1.24 to 43.29), anxiety disorder (OR 2.88, CI 1.04 to 7.97), high-suicide risk (OR 3.42, CI 1.86 to 13.67) and comorbidity (OR 1.41, CI 1.05 to 1.90)., DISCUSSION AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in homeless young people was high and considerably higher than that reported for this age group in the general population. There is a need for improved uptake of services delivering longer term treatment of psychiatric problems among vulnerable groups of socially excluded young people.

N2  - This study investigates 500 homeless adults and the associations between childhood maltreatment types and the age of first reported homelessness episode. Those first experiencing homelessness in youth (age 24 years or younger; 46%) were compared with those first experiencing homelessness at a later age (older than age 24 years). In individual models, physical abuse, emotional abuse, and emotional neglect were associated with first experiencing homelessness during youth (p < .02 for all types of maltreatment). In the simultaneous model, only emotional abuse remained significantly associated (p = .002). In addition, increasing numbers of maltreatment were associated with becoming homeless during youth (p < .0001). These results highlight the unique associations between childhood maltreatment types and becoming homeless earlier in life and support the need for early interventions with at-risk families.

T1  - "New beginnings" in South African shelters for the homeless: piloting of a group psychotherapy intervention for high-risk mother-infant dyads.

N2  - The New Beginnings program was developed at the Anna Freud Centre and originally piloted in Her Majesty Prisons in the United Kingdom. This study aimed to explore the use of this manualized parent-infant psychotherapy group model in an African setting with high-risk mother-infant dyads, and describes the implementation and investigation of this 12-week group psychotherapy intervention in two Johannesburg shelters for homeless women. The measures used to investigate treatment efficacy were the Parent Development Interview (A. Slade, J.L. Aber, I. Bresgi, B. Berger, & M. Kaplan,), the Emotional Availability Scales (Z. Biringen, J.L. Robinson, & R.N. Emde,), the Kessler-10 (R.C. Kessler et al.,), and the Griffiths Scales of Mental Development (D. Luiz et al., . At pretesting, infants exhibited delays in a number of developmental areas, and mothers showed high levels of depression and generally low capacities for reflective function. While significant shifts in the mothers' capacities for reflective function were not found in the treatment condition, significant shifts were found in the infants' speech abilities and in the mothers' abilities to structure their interactions with their infants. This suggests that the program enabled mothers to become more sensitized to their infants' needs in interaction and that communication between mother and infant increased. The number of sessions attended by the dyads correlated with improvements made by the mothers and their infants. Copyright © 2014 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To identify barriers that are common and unique to six selected vulnerable groups: low socioeconomic status; Indigenous; mental illness and substance abuse; homeless; prisoners; and at-risk youth., DESIGN: A systematic review was carried out to identify the perceived barriers to smoking cessation within six vulnerable groups., DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycInfo were searched using keywords and MeSH terms from each database's inception published prior to March 2014., STUDY SELECTION: Studies that provided either qualitative or quantitative (ie, longitudinal, cross-sectional or cohort surveys) descriptions of self-reported perceived barriers to quitting smoking in one of the six aforementioned vulnerable groups were included., DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data., RESULTS: 65 eligible papers were identified: 24 with low socioeconomic groups, 16 with Indigenous groups, 18 involving people with a mental illness, 3 with homeless groups, 2 involving prisoners and 1 involving at-risk youth. One study identified was carried out with participants who were homeless and addicted to alcohol and/or other drugs. Barriers common to all vulnerable groups included: smoking for stress management, lack of support from health and other service providers, and the high prevalence and acceptability of smoking in vulnerable communities. Unique barriers were identified for people with a mental illness (eg, maintenance of mental health), Indigenous groups (eg, cultural and historical norms), prisoners (eg, living conditions), people who are homeless (eg, competing priorities) and at-risk youth (eg, high accessibility of tobacco)., CONCLUSIONS: Vulnerable groups experience common barriers to smoking cessation, in addition to barriers that are unique to specific vulnerable groups. Individual-level, community-level and social network-level interventions are priority areas for future smoking cessation interventions within vulnerable groups., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: A protocol for this review has been registered with PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (Identifier: CRD42013005761).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an active case-finding strategy among drug users (DUs), economically disadvantaged individuals and recent immigrants from hyperendemic countries, a population at high risk of developing tuberculosis (TB)., METHODS: Retrospective, observational study carried out by the Tuberculosis Unit of the City of Barcelona from September 2009 to December 2012. All participants underwent chest X-ray and were screened for symptoms., RESULTS: Of 5982 participants screened, 30 TB cases were detected (total prevalence 0.5%): 26 were pulmonary, 8 were smear-positive and 2 were resistant to multiple drugs. Directly observed treatment was advised for 19 patients (63%). TB prevalence in the recent immigrants group was significantly greater (1.77%) than in all other groups studied: economically disadvantaged individuals 0.30% (RR 5.9, 95%CI 2.30-15.14); DUs 0.62% (RR 2.05, 95%CI 0.91-4.64), non-recent immigrants 0.41% (RR 4.31, 95%CI 1.68-11.4); and all native-born individuals 0.41% (RR 4.33, 95%CI 1.71-10.92). The rate was much greater than the estimated prevalence for the general population of the city (~20 cases/100,000 population)., CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk groups, active case finding can be used as a public health intervention to detect a large number of TB cases.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This mixed methods study explored the characteristics of and experiences with perceived discrimination in an ethnically diverse urban sample of adults experiencing homelessness and mental illness., METHODS: Data were collected in Toronto, Ontario, as part of a 4-year national randomized field trial of the Housing First treatment model. Rates of perceived discrimination were captured from survey questions regarding perceived discrimination among 231 ethnoracially diverse participants with moderate mental health needs. The qualitative component included thirty six in-depth interviews which explored how individuals who bear these multiple identities of oppression navigate stigma and discrimination, and what affects their capacity to do so., RESULTS: Quantitative analysis revealed very high rates of perceived discrimination related to: homelessness/poverty (61.5%), race/ethnicity/skin colour (50.6%) and mental illness/substance use (43.7%). Immigrants and those who had been homeless three or more years reported higher perceived discrimination on all three domains. Analysis of qualitative interviews revealed three common themes related to navigating these experiences of discrimination among participants: 1) social distancing; 2) old and new labels/identities; and, 3) 'homeland' cultures., CONCLUSIONS: These study findings underscore poverty and homelessness as major sources of perceived discrimination, and expose underlying complexities in the navigation of multiple identities in responding to stigma and discrimination., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN42520374 .

N2  - We designed and pilot-tested a group-based, work-related cognitive-behavioral therapy (WCBT) for unemployed individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD). WCBT, delivered in a vocational service setting by vocational service professionals, aims to reduce social anxiety and enable individuals to seek, obtain, and retain employment. We compared WCBT to a vocational services as usual control condition (VSAU). Participants were unemployed, homeless, largely African American, vocational service-seeking adults with SAD (N = 58), randomized to receive either eight sessions of WCBT plus VSAU or VSAU alone and followed three months post-treatment. Multilevel modeling revealed significantly greater reductions in social anxiety, general anxiety, depression, and functional impairment for WCBT compared to VSAU. Coefficients for job search activity and self-efficacy indicated greater increases for WCBT. Hours worked per week in the follow-up period did not differ between the groups, but small sample size and challenges associated with measuring work hours may have contributed to this finding. Overall, the results of this study suggest that unemployed persons with SAD can be effectively treated with specialized work-related CBT administered by vocational service professionals. Future testing of WCBT with a larger sample, a longer follow-up period, and adequate power to assess employment outcomes is warranted. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the prevalence of Multiple Comorbid Chronic Disease (MCCD) within homeless and non-homeless Veterans and the association between MCCD and inpatient medical care., METHODS: All individuals seen in the VA North Texas Health Care System between October 1, 2009 and September 30, 2010 (n = 102,034) were evaluated. Homelessness during the year and the number of common chronic diseases were evaluated for an association with likelihood of medical and psychiatric hospitalizations, bed days of care, inpatient substance treatment, rehabilitation admissions, and emergency department visits., RESULTS: Homeless Veterans had higher all-cause mortality rates and rates of use of almost all resources after controlling for chronic disease burden using the Charlson Comorbidity Index, psychiatric illnesses, substance use disorders, and demographic variables., CONCLUSIONS: Homelessness Veterans are vulnerable to a high use of resources and mortality, independent of medical and psychiatric conditions. This finding should focus additional attention on reducing homelessness. Copyright Published by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this article is to present the rationale and baseline results for a randomized controlled pilot trial using economic incentives to reduce HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk among male sex workers (MSWs) in Mexico City., METHODS: Participants (n=267) were tested and treated for STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and HIV) and viral hepatitis (hepatitis B and C), received HIV and STI prevention education and were randomized into four groups: (1) control, (2) medium conditional incentive ($50/six months), (3) high conditional incentive ($75/six months) and (4) unconditional incentive ($50/six months). In the conditional arms, incentives were contingent upon testing free of new curable STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis) at follow-up assessments., RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 25 years; 8% were homeless or lived in a shelter, 16% were unemployed and 21% lived in Mexico City less than 5 years. At baseline, 38% were living with HIV, and 32% tested positive for viral hepatitis or at least one STI (other than HIV). Participants had a mean of five male clients in the previous week; 18% reported condomless sex with their last client. For 37%, sex work was their main occupation and was conducted mainly on the streets (51%) or in bars/discotheques (24%) and hotels (24%). The average price for a sex transaction was $25 with a 35% higher payment for condomless sex., CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that economic incentives are a relevant approach for HIV prevention among MSWs, given the market-based inducements for unprotected sex. This type of targeted intervention seems to be justified and should continue to be explored in the context of combination prevention efforts.

T1  - Design and rationale of the Paliperidone Palmitate Research in Demonstrating Effectiveness (PRIDE) study: a novel comparative trial of once-monthly paliperidone palmitate versus daily oral antipsychotic treatment for delaying time to treatment failure in persons with schizophrenia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Public health considerations require that clinical trials address the complex "real-world" needs of patients with chronic illnesses. This is particularly true for persons with schizophrenia, whose management is frequently complicated by factors such as comorbid substance abuse, homelessness, and contact with the criminal justice system. In addition, barriers to obtaining health care in the United States often prevent successful community reentry and optimal patient management. Further, nonadherence to treatment is common, and this reinforces cycles of relapse and recidivism. Long-acting injectable antipsychotic therapy may facilitate continuity of treatment and support better outcomes, particularly in patients who face these challenges. Clinical trials with classical explanatory designs may not be the best approaches for evaluating these considerations. We describe the design and rationale of a novel trial that combines both explanatory and pragmatic design features and studies persons with schizophrenia who face these challenges., DESIGN AND RATIONALE: The Paliperidone Palmitate Research in Demonstrating Effectiveness (PRIDE) study is a prospective, open-label, randomized, 15-month study conducted between May 5, 2010, and December 9, 2013, comparing long-acting injectable paliperidone palmitate and oral antipsychotic medications in subjects with schizophrenia (according to DSM-IV criteria). Investigators and subjects had broad flexibility for treatment decision-making, thus making it a model that better reflects real-world practice. The primary end point was time to treatment failure, defined as arrest/incarceration psychiatric hospitalization; suicide; treatment discontinuation or supplementation due to inadequate efficacy, safety, or tolerability; or increased psychiatric services to prevent hospitalization. This end point was adjudicated by a blinded event monitoring board. Patients were followed to the 15-month end point, regardless of whether they were maintained on their initial randomized treatment. This article provides some of the reasoning behind the authors' choices when combining features from both explanatory and pragmatic approaches to this trial's design., CONCLUSIONS: The PRIDE study incorporates real-world design features in a novel, prospective, comparative study of long-acting injectable and oral antipsychotics in persons with schizophrenia who have had recent contact with the criminal justice system. Insights provided should help the reader to better understand the need for more real-world approaches for clinical studies and how a broader approach can better aid clinical treatment and public health decision-making., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01157351. © Copyright 2014 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Limited research exists that investigates hospital admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs) among the homeless, who frequently lack a usual source of care. This study profiled ACSC admissions for homeless patients., METHODS: Bivariate analyses and logistic regression were completed to investigate ACSC and non-ACSC admissions among homeless patients using the 2010 California State Inpatient Database., RESULTS: Homeless patients admitted for an ACSC were mostly male, non-Hispanic white, and on average 49.9 years old. In the predictive model, the odds of an ACSC admission among homeless patients increased when they were black, admitted to the emergency department or transferred from another health facility. Having Medicare was associated with a decreased odds of an ACSC admission., CONCLUSIONS: Specific characteristics are associated with a greater likelihood of an ACSC admission. Research should examine how these characteristics contribute to ACSC hospitalizations and findings should be linked to programs designed to serve as a safety-net for homeless patients to reduce hospitalizations.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Little is known about influences of sample selection on estimation in propensity score matching. The purpose of the study was to assess potential selection bias using one-to-one greedy matching versus optimal full matching as part of an evaluation of supportive housing in New York City (NYC)., STUDY DESIGN AND SETTINGS: Data came from administrative data for 2 groups of applicants who were eligible for an NYC supportive housing program in 2007-09, including chronically homeless adults with a substance use disorder and young adults aging out of foster care. We evaluated the 2 matching methods in their ability to balance covariates and represent the original population, and in how those methods affected outcomes related to Medicaid expenditures., RESULTS: In the population with a substance use disorder, only optimal full matching performed well in balancing covariates, whereas both methods created representative populations. In the young adult population, both methods balanced covariates effectively, but only optimal full matching created representative populations. In the young adult population, the impact of the program on Medicaid expenditures was attenuated when one-to-one greedy matching was used, compared with optimal full matching., CONCLUSION: Given covariate balancing with both methods, attenuated program impacts in the young adult population indicated that one-to-one greedy matching introduced selection bias.

N2  - PURPOSE: Few studies have examined gender-based differences in the risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among street-involved youth. We compared rates of HCV infection among male and female street-involved youth in a Canadian setting., METHODS: The At-Risk Youth Study is a prospective cohort of drug-using street-involved youth. Study recruitment and follow-up occurred in Vancouver, Canada, between September 2005 and November 2011. Eligible participants were illicit drug-using youth aged 14-26 years at enrollment, recruited by street-based outreach. We evaluated rates of HCV antibody seroconversion, measured every 6 months during study follow-up, and used Cox proportional hazards regression to compare risk factors for HCV incidence between male and female street youth., RESULTS: Among 512 HCV-seronegative youth contributing 836 person-years of follow-up, 56 (10.9%) seroconverted to HCV. Among female participants, the incidence density of HCV infection was 10.9 per 100 person-years, and in males, it was 5.1 per 100 person-years (p = .009). In multivariate analyses, female gender was independently associated with a higher rate of HCV seroconversion (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-3.44). Risk factors were similar in gender-stratified analyses and included heroin injection and crystal methamphetamine injection, although syringe sharing was only associated with HCV incidence among males., CONCLUSIONS: Among street-involved youth in this setting, females had double the incidence of HCV seroconversion demonstrating the need for gender-focused HCV prevention interventions for this population.

N2  - The idea that group contexts can intensify emotions is centuries old. Yet, evidence that speaks to how, or if, emotions become more intense in groups remains elusive. Here we examine the novel possibility that group attention--the experience of simultaneous coattention with one's group members--increases emotional intensity relative to attending alone, coattending with strangers, or attending nonsimultaneously with one's group members. In Study 1, scary advertisements felt scarier under group attention. In Study 2, group attention intensified feelings of sadness to negative images, and feelings of happiness to positive images. In Study 3, group attention during a video depicting homelessness led to greater sadness that prompted larger donations to charities benefiting the homeless. In Studies 4 and 5, group attention increased the amount of cognitive resources allocated toward sad and amusing videos (as indexed by the percentage of thoughts referencing video content), leading to more sadness and happiness, respectively. In all, these effects could not be explained by differences in physiological arousal, emotional contagion, or vicarious emotional experience. Greater fear, gloom, and glee can thus result from group attention to scary, sad, and happy events, respectively.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Approximately 70% of homeless youth smoke cigarettes, but their use of alternative tobacco products (ATPs) is unknown. This paper reports on ATP use among past-month smokers in Los Angeles County, including whether it differs by demographic characteristics, homelessness severity, past-year quit attempts, and readiness to quit smoking. Given the growing popularity of e-cigarettes, we also report on perceptions of harm and reasons for using this product., METHODS: We surveyed 292 unaccompanied homeless youth who were randomly sampled from street sites. Participants had smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and 1 cigarette during the past month., RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of youth reported past-month ATP use (e-cigarettes = 51%; little cigars/cigarillos = 46%; hookah = 31%; other smokeless tobacco product = 24%; chewing tobacco/moist snuff = 19%). Current ATP use was unrelated to most demographic characteristics or having a past-year quit attempt. However, youth who planned to quit smoking in the next 30 days were significantly less likely to report current use of hookahs, other smokeless tobacco products, or e-cigarettes. Among lifetime e-cigarette users, the most common reasons for use included not having to go outside to smoke (38%) and being able to deal with situations or places where they cannot smoke (36%); it was less common to report using e-cigarettes to quit smoking (17%-18%)., DISCUSSION: Dual use of ATPs among homeless youth smokers is common and is more likely among those who have no immediate plans to quit smoking. Effective and easily disseminable strategies for reducing all forms of tobacco use among homeless youth are urgently needed.

N2  - African American women at increased risk of HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) may engage in risky sex as a coping mechanism for depressed economic conditions. This study examines the association between high-risk sexual behavior and structural determinants of sexual health among a sample of young African American women. 237 young African American women (16-19 years old) from economically disadvantaged neighborhoods in North Carolina were enrolled into a randomized trial testing the efficacy of an adapted HIV/STI prevention intervention. Logistic regression analyses predicted the likelihood that young women reporting lack of food at home, homelessness and low future prospects would also report sexual risk behaviors. Young women reporting a lack of food at home (22 %), homelessness (27 %), and low perceived education/employment prospects (19 %) had between 2.2 and 4.7 times the odds as those not reporting these risk factors of reporting multiple sex partners, risky sex partners including older men and partners involved in gangs, substance use prior to sex, and exchange sex. Self-reported structural determinants of sexual health were associated with myriad sexual risk behaviors. Diminished economic conditions among these young women may lead to sexual risk due to hopelessness, the need for survival or other factors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in risk groups in Krakow, using the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) test and the tuberculin skin test (TST); we also sought to assess the rate of progression to active disease over 4-5 y of follow-up., METHODS: QFT-GIT tests were performed on 785 subjects and the TST on 701 subjects from the risk groups of homeless persons, close contacts, periodic contacts, and residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs), and subjects from a low risk group., RESULTS: In homeless persons, close contacts, periodic contacts, LTCF residents, and low risk persons, a positive QFT-GIT was found in 36.7%, 27.2%, 27.0%, 21.1%, and 23.7% of subjects, respectively, while a positive TST was found in 55.8%, 47.4%, 47.6%, 43.2%, and 47.9%, respectively. Of 63 homeless subjects, 5 developed active TB over 248 person-y of follow-up (incidence rate (IR) 20 per 1000 person-y, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.4-48.5); of 148 close contacts, 5 developed active TB over 740 person-y of follow-up (IR 7, 95% CI 2.8-16.2); of 145 periodic contacts, 2 developed active TB over 580 person-y of follow-up (IR 4, 95% CI 0.9-13.8). The IR per 1000 person-y (95% CI) among subjects with a positive QFT-GIT was 30 (9.0-86.1) for homeless subjects, 18 (5.7-54.7) for close contacts, and 13 (3.2-51.3) for periodic contacts. In Poland there is no policy for the provision of LTBI treatment to people with a positive QFT or TST; therefore, the estimated rates of disease progression were analysed amongst untreated subjects., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of positive QFT-GIT and TST was high in the study risk groups. The best predictor of active TB in the homeless and close contacts groups was a positive QFT-GIT together with a positive TST.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Permanent supported housing programs are being implemented throughout the United States. This study examined the relationship between fidelity to the Housing First model and residential outcomes among clients of full service partnerships (FSPs) in California., METHODS: This study had a mixed-methods design. Quantitative administrative and survey data were used to describe FSP practices and to examine the association between fidelity to Housing First and residential outcomes in the year before and after enrollment of 6,584 FSP clients in 86 programs. Focus groups at 20 FSPs provided qualitative data to enhance the understanding of these findings with actual accounts of housing-related experiences in high- and low-fidelity programs., RESULTS: Prior to enrollment, the mean days of homelessness were greater at high- versus low-fidelity (101 versus 46 days) FSPs. After adjustment for individual characteristics, the analysis found that days spent homeless after enrollment declined by 87 at high-fidelity programs and by 34 at low-fidelity programs. After adjustment for days spent homeless before enrollment, days spent homeless after enrollment declined by 63 at high-fidelity programs and by 53 at low-fidelity programs. After enrollment, clients at high-fidelity programs spent more than 60 additional days in apartments than clients at low-facility programs. Differences were found between high- and low-fidelity FSPs in client choice in housing and how much clients' goals were considered in housing placement., CONCLUSIONS: Programs with greater fidelity to the Housing First model enrolled clients with longer histories of homelessness and placed most of them in apartments.

N2  - To inform the development and assess potential use of rectal microbicide gels for HIV prevention among men who have sex with men (MSM), we examined the dynamics and contexts of commercial lubricant use during receptive anal intercourse (RAI) within this population. From 2007 to 2010, 168 HIV-negative MSM living in Los Angeles who practice RAI completed computer-assisted self-interviews, which collected information on their last sexual event with <=3 recent partners, at baseline, three months, and one-year study visits. Logistic generalized linear mixed models were used to identify individual- and sexual event-level characteristics associated with commercial lubricant use during RAI at the last sexual event within 421 partnerships reported by participants over the course of follow-up. During RAI at their last sexual event, 57% of partnerships used a condom and 69% used commercial lubricant. Among partnerships that used commercial lubricant, 56% reported lubricant application by both members of the partnership, 66% first applied lubricant during sex, but before penetration, and 98% applied lubricant at multiple locations. The relationship between substance use and commercial lubricant use varied by condom use (interaction p-value = 0.01). Substance use was positively associated with commercial lubricant use within partnerships that did not use condoms during RAI at their last sexual event (AOR = 4.47, 95% [corrected] [CI]: 1.63-12.28), but no association was observed within partnerships that did use condoms (AOR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.23-1.85). Commercial lubricant use during RAI was also positively associated with reporting more sexual partners (AOR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05-1.31), while older age (units = 5 years; AOR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61-0.94), homelessness (past year; AOR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.13-0.76), and having sex with an older (>10 years) partner (AOR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.14-0.95) were negatively associated with commercial lubricant use. These factors should be considered in the development of rectal microbicide gels to enhance their acceptability and use among MSM.

N2  - The housing first (HF) model for individuals experiencing homelessness and mental illness differs by design from traditional models that require consumers to achieve "housing readiness" by meeting program or treatment prerequisites in transitional housing settings prior to permanent housing placement. Given a growing body of evidence for its favorable outcomes and cost effectiveness, HF is increasingly seen as an alternative to and argument against these traditional programs. As such, it is important that the elements and implementation challenges of the HF model be clearly understood and articulated. This qualitative study explored a largely unexamined aspect of the HF model-the need for and meaning of temporary residential settings (interim housing), a place to stay while waiting to secure permanent housing-using interviews and focus groups with service providers and consumers who experienced interim housing during implementation of HF in a large urban center. Although interim housing may not be necessary for all programs implementing the model, our study revealed numerous reasons and demands for safe, flexible interim housing options, and illustrated how they influence the effectiveness of consumer recovery, continuous service engagement, and housing stability.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is increasing recognition of the cognitive consequences of socioeconomic adversity during childhood, which can impair learning and negatively affect social and emotional development. However, there is a paucity of research on cognitive functioning and mental health among transition-age homeless youth. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap by examining the prevalence and functional significance of cognitive impairment and mental health disorders in a sample of 18- to 22-year-old homeless youth., METHODS: Participants (N = 73) were recruited from a vocational support program at Covenant House New York, a care agency for homeless youth. Assessments included diagnostic assessment for mental health disorders and evaluation of neurocognition and vocational outcomes., RESULTS: Youth demonstrated histories of academic instability, academic achievement below expectation, and high rates of untreated psychiatric disorders, the most prominent of which were anxiety, substance use, and mood disorders. Of those who had a mental health diagnosis, more than half demonstrated cognitive deficits. Performance on measures of working memory and verbal memory was <70% of that of the age-matched normative population. Cognitive impairment was associated with a significant risk for making a wage insufficient for independent living., CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the need to focus on cognitive as well as emotional and physical health in transition-age youth. Comprehensive intervention at this later developmental stage has the potential to facilitate the acquisition of skills needed for academic, vocational, and independent living success in adulthood.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Chronically homeless adults with severe alcohol problems are disproportionately burdened with health-care problems and are high utilizers of emergency medical services (EMS). Single-site Housing First (HF), which provides immediate, permanent, low-barrier, nonabstinence-based, supportive housing, has been associated with reduced publicly funded service utilization. The aims of the current study were to determine whether time spent in single-site HF predicted decreases in EMS contacts 2 years subsequent to single-site HF move-in, and to describe medical conditions and injuries associated with EMS contacts in a sample of chronically homeless individuals with severe alcohol problems., METHODS: Participants were 91 chronically homeless adults with severe alcohol problems who were enrolled in a single-site HF program between December 2005 and March 2007 in Seattle, Washington. We obtained administrative data on exposure to HF and EMS utilization for the 2 years prior to and the 2 years subsequent to participants' move-in date. EMS utilization variables included patient type (i.e., primary presenting problem), trauma/injury mechanism (i.e., EMS classification of the cause of the trauma or injury), level of care (i.e., basic life support, advanced life support), and transport destination., RESULTS: After controlling for baseline EMS contacts, participants evinced 3% fewer EMS contacts for each additional month of single-site HF exposure. From the baseline to follow-up period, the mean number of EMS contacts declined from 15.85 (SD = 22.96) to 9.54 (SD = 15.08), representing a 54% reduction in the number of EMS contacts. Most calls were responded to by EMTs providing basic life support, and the majority resulted in transport to a local level I trauma center. The most common presenting difficulties were medical illness and trauma. Substance use and psychiatric difficulties were infrequently documented as the primary problem., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support recent assertions that housing is health care and indicate that the amount of time spent in single-site HF is associated with significant reductions in EMS utilization for at least 2 years subsequent to move-in. These findings also underscore the high levels of medical illness and trauma exposure among chronically homeless adults with severe alcohol problems.

T1  - The impact of housing displacement on the mental health of low-income parents after Hurricane Katrina.

N2  - Previous studies in the aftermath of natural disasters have demonstrated relationships between four dimensions of displacement - geographic distance from the predisaster community, type of postdisaster housing, number of postdisaster moves, and time spent in temporary housing - and adverse psychological outcomes. However, to date no study has explored how these dimensions operate in tandem. The literature is further limited by a reliance on postdisaster data. We addressed these limitations in a study of low-income parents, predominantly non-Hispanic Black single mothers, who survived Hurricane Katrina and who completed pre and postdisaster assessments (N = 392). Using latent profile analysis, we demonstrated three profiles of displacement experiences within the sample: (1) returned, characterized by return to a predisaster community; (2) relocated, characterized by relocation to a new community, and (3) unstably housed, characterized by long periods in temporary housing and multiple moves. Using regression analyses, we assessed the relationship between displacement profiles and three mental health outcomes (general psychological distress, posttraumatic stress, and perceived stress), controlling for predisaster characteristics and mental health indices and hurricane-related experiences. Relative to participants in the returned profile, those in the relocated profile had significantly higher general psychological distress and perceived stress, and those in the unstably housed profile had significantly higher perceived stress. Based on these results, we suggest interventions and policies that reduce postdisaster housing instability and prioritize mental health services in communities receiving evacuees.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It is well documented that childhood abuse, neglect and household dysfunction are disproportionately present in the backgrounds of homeless adults, and that these experiences adversely impact child development and a wide range of adult outcomes. However, few studies have examined the cumulative impact of adverse childhood experiences on homeless adults with mental illness. This study examines adverse events in childhood as predictors of duration of homelessness, psychiatric and substance use disorders, and physical health in a sample of homeless adults with mental illness., METHODS: This study was conducted using baseline data from a randomized controlled trial in Vancouver, British Columbia for participants who completed the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) scale at 18 months follow-up (n=364). Primary outcomes included current mental disorders; substance use including type, frequency and severity; physical health; duration of homelessness; and vocational functioning., RESULTS: In multivariable regression models, ACE total score independently predicted a range of mental health, physical health, and substance use problems, and marginally predicted duration of homelessness., CONCLUSIONS: Adverse childhood experiences are overrepresented among homeless adults with complex comorbidities and chronic homelessness. Our findings are consistent with a growing body of literature indicating that childhood traumas are potent risk factors for a number of adult health and psychiatric problems, particularly substance use problems. Results are discussed in the context of cumulative adversity and self-trauma theory., TRIALS REGISTRATION: This trial has been registered with the International Standard Randomized Control Trial Number Register and assigned ISRCTN42520374.

N2  - Women at high-risk for HIV acquisition often face challenges that hinder their retention in HIV prevention trials. These same challenges may contribute to missed clinical care visits among HIV-infected women. This article, informed by the Gelberg-Andersen Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, identifies factors associated with missed study visits and describes the multifaceted retention strategies used by study sites. HPTN 064 was a multisite, longitudinal HIV seroincidence study in 10 US communities. Eligible women were aged 18-44 years, resided in a census tract/zipcode with high poverty and HIV prevalence, and self-reported >=1 personal or sex partner behavior related to HIV acquisition. Multivariate analyses of predisposing (e.g., substance use) and enabling (e.g., unmet health care needs) characteristics, and study attributes (i.e., recruitment venue, time of enrollment) identified factors associated with missed study visits. Retention strategies included: community engagement; interpersonal relationship building; reduction of external barriers; staff capacity building; and external tracing. Visit completion was 93% and 94% at 6 and 12 months. Unstable housing and later date of enrollment were associated with increased likelihood of missed study visits. Black race, recruitment from an outdoor venue, and financial responsibility for children were associated with greater likelihood of attendance. Multifaceted retention strategies may reduce missed study visits. Knowledge of factors associated with missed visits may help to focus efforts.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The Intramedullary Skeletal Kinetic Distractor (ISKD) (Orthofix Inc, Lewisville, TX, USA) is an intramedullary device designed for more comfortable limb lengthening than that with external fixators; lengthening is achieved with this nail using rotational oscillation between two telescoping sections. However, the degree to which this device achieves this goal and its complication rate have not been fully documented., QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We determined (1) the frequency with which distraction was not achieved at the desired rate, (2) whether pain differed between patients with normally and abnormally distracting nails, (3) risk factors for abnormal nails, and (4) other complications., METHODS: We analyzed 35 lengthening segments (26 femurs, nine tibias) in 19 patients. Mean length achieved was 47 mm. Femoral nails were categorized into four groups according to distraction rate: normal, runaway (unintentionally faster rate [> 1.5 mm/day]), difficult-to-distract (slower rate [< 0.8 mm/day] requiring manual manipulation but not requiring general anesthesia), and nondistracting (slower rate [< 0.8 mm/day] requiring manual manipulation under general anesthesia or reosteotomy). Possible risk factors, including age, BMI, preoperative thigh circumferences, degree of intramedullary overreaming, and length of the thicker portion of the nail within the distal fragment, were compared among groups. VAS pain scores were compared among groups under three conditions: rest, physiotherapy, and distraction motion. Complications were also analyzed. Minimum followup was 15 months (mean, 26 months; range, 15-38 months) after first-stage surgery., RESULTS: Abnormal distraction rate was observed in 21 of 35 segments (60%; 17 femurs, four tibias). VAS pain scores showed no differences among groups during rest or physiotherapy but were higher (p = 0.02) in the problematic nails (7-8 points) versus normal nails (3 points) during distraction. Only mean length of the thicker portion of the nail within the distal fragment differed between normally and abnormally distracting nails (95 mm versus 100 mm; p = 0.03), although this was unlikely to be clinically important. Complications occurred in 10 patients (53%), including five with decreased ankle ROM during distraction, four with delayed bone healing, and one with mechanical device failure during distraction., CONCLUSIONS: Rate control was difficult to achieve with the ISKD nail for femoral and tibial lengthenings, complications were relatively common, and among patients in whom rate control was not achieved, pain levels were high. Based on our findings, we believe that surgeons should avoid use of this nail., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.

In particular, the effect of a family systems therapy, Ecologically Based Family Therapy (EBFT), and two individual therapies, the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) and Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), on adolescent and primary caretaker (PC) depressive symptoms were compared. Findings showed that youth's depressive symptoms were significantly reduced in each treatment to 2 years postbaseline. However, the trajectory of change differed across treatments, with adolescents receiving MET showing a more rapid reduction in depressive symptoms but a quicker increase in symptoms compared with adolescents receiving EBFT. PCs receiving EBFT showed a statistically significant decline in depressive symptoms, but this was not observed for the CRA and MET conditions. These findings can be interpreted to favor EBFT, although future research is needed to test training and implementation strategies for family systems therapies in community-based runaway shelters.

N2  - UNLABELLED: This research belongs to a more comprehensive study on the care of street children in Cameroon. The idea is to develop an analysis of the street pathology where symptoms such as addictive behavior and drug addiction can be found. Beside HIV AIDS, addictive behaviors are the main risk factors that many professionals have to face with while dealing with the street problems today., AIM: Through an intercultural approach, we examined the practices of addictive typology, their initiatory role and their function in the integration of the street system. We also analysed their importance in the survival strategies. After an overview of theoretical controversies that feed the debate on addictions, we questioned the impact of these practices on the street career through the prism of general theory of addictions, particularly the hedonic management model. Addiction helps to resist adversity, it helps to desist and then to begin a harmonious neo development despite the horrors of the street experience., METHODOLOGY: We undertook a quantitative and qualitative study on a sample of 148 street children. We proposed to 128 of them a questionnaire focused on addictive behaviors and survival strategies in the street context. We notably evaluated the street career of 24 of them, using interviews and standardized tests to assess self-esteem (Coopersmith's SEI) frustration tolerance (Rosenweig's P-F) and self-efficacy (Sherer's SE Scale) in order to measure the impact of addictive behaviors on the resilience process., RESULTS: We found that the street career is essentially traumatic, and that addictive behaviors involving various integration strategies are strongly linked to the interculturation process through the identity strategies and the intercultural competences. Addiction itself is not significantly related to self-esteem issues but strongly impacts on self-efficacy and the ability to tolerate frustration. They allow the street children to withstand the street adversity but are a real obstacle to their resilience process. Copyright © 2013 L'Encephale, Paris. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - When nurses possess negative attitudes toward people with low socio-economic status it can negatively influence patient care. This study examines whether providing care in a service-learning environment positively affects nursing students' world views and empathy toward the poor. Using a pre-post design, the Attitudes about Poverty and Poor People Scale and the Just World Scale were administered to both a control group and nursing students engaged in a clinical rotation at a low-income housing facility or homeless shelter in spring and fall 2010. Findings show the service learning treatment modestly enhanced empathy and students' views on justice, while not improving superficial perceptions of the poor. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - This case-control study describes the health situation, internal and external resources, and utilisation of healthcare facilities by a marginalised population consisting of homeless people in Vienna, Austria, compared with a non-homeless control population. Among the homeless group, participants lived in halfway houses (70%) or permanent housing (30%) in Vienna. Personal interviews were conducted in July 2010 with 66 homeless individuals, and their data were compared with data from non-homeless subjects from the Austrian Health Interview Survey using conditional logistic regression. Compared with the control group, homeless persons suffered more often from chronic diseases (P < 0.001) and rated their health considerably lower than the comparison group (P < 0.001). Homeless people suffered significantly more often from psychiatric disorders, respiratory diseases, hypertension (P < 0.001), digestive system diseases (P = 0.002) and heart diseases (P = 0.015) in comparison with the control group. Additionally, among homeless and non-homeless individuals, the former more often consulted a general practitioner in a period of 28 days (P = 0.002). A significantly greater proportion of homeless people did not have any teeth (P = 0.024) and smoked significantly more (P = 0.002). The results demonstrate deficits in the areas of health, health behaviour, and individual and social resources of homeless people, even though homeless people seek medical care at a higher rate than controls. Continuing health promotion projects for this high-risk group and the strengthening of social resources are recommended. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - A culturally diverse sample of formerly homeless youth (ages 6-12) and their families (n = 223) participated in a cluster randomized controlled trial of the Early Risers conduct problems prevention program in a supportive housing setting. Parents provided 4 annual behaviorally-based ratings of executive functioning (EF) and conduct problems, including at baseline, over 2 years of intervention programming, and at a 1-year follow-up assessment. Using intent-to-treat analyses, a multilevel latent growth model revealed that the intervention group demonstrated reduced growth in conduct problems over the 4 assessment points. In order to examine mediation, a multilevel parallel process latent growth model was used to simultaneously model growth in EF and growth in conduct problems along with intervention status as a covariate. A significant mediational process emerged, with participation in the intervention promoting growth in EF, which predicted negative growth in conduct problems. The model was consistent with changes in EF fully mediating intervention-related changes in youth conduct problems over the course of the study. These findings highlight the critical role that EF plays in behavioral change and lends further support to its importance as a target in preventive interventions with populations at risk for conduct problems.

N2  - Multiple studies of homeless persons report an increased prevalence of a history in-care, but there is a dearth of information on associated outcomes or relevant demographic profiles. This information is critical to understanding if certain individuals are at elevated risk or might benefit from specific intervention. Here, we investigate how a history in-care relates to demographics and multiple outcome measures in a homeless population with mental illness. Using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), the Short-Form 12, and a trauma questionnaire, we investigated baseline differences in demographics and length of homelessness in the At Home/Chez Soi Trial (N=504) Winnipeg homeless population with and without a history in-care. Approximately 50% of the homeless sample reported a history in-care. This group was significantly more likely to be young, female, married or cohabitating, of Aboriginal heritage, have less education, and have longer lifetime homelessness. Individuals of Aboriginal heritage with a history in-care were significantly more likely to report a familial history of residential school. Individuals with a history in-care experienced different prevalence rates of Axis 1 mental disorders. Those with a history in-care also reported significantly more traumatic events (particularly interpersonal). A distinctive high-risk profile emerged for individuals with a history in-care. Sociocultural factors of colonization and intergenerational transmission of trauma appear to be particularly relevant in the trajectories for individuals of Aboriginal heritage. Given the high prevalence of a history in-care, interventions and policy should reflect the specific vulnerability of this population, particularly in regards to trauma-informed services.

N2  - Although meditation is increasingly accepted as having personal benefits, less is known about the broader impact of meditation on social and intergroup relations. We tested the effect of lovingkindness meditation training on improving implicit attitudes toward members of 2 stigmatized social outgroups: Blacks and homeless people. Healthy non-Black, nonhomeless adults (N = 101) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: 6-week lovingkindness practice, 6-week lovingkindness discussion (a closely matched active control), or waitlist control. Decreases in implicit bias against stigmatized outgroups (as measured by Implicit Association Test) were observed only in the lovingkindness practice condition. Reduced psychological stress mediated the effect of lovingkindness practice on implicit bias against homeless people, but it did not mediate the reduced bias against Black people. These results suggest that lovingkindness meditation can improve automatically activated, implicit attitudes toward stigmatized social groups and that this effect occurs through distinctive mechanisms for different stigmatized social groups.

N2  - BACKGROUND: One of the most controversial aspects of New York City's highly effective TB control program is the use of public health law and court-ordered detention to treat persistently recalcitrant patients with active TB. We now report on characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing detention for completion of TB treatment due to nonadherence in New York City from 2002 through 2009., METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was designed to compare patients undergoing court-ordered detention (n = 79) and time-matched control subjects undergoing TB treatment in outpatient directly observed therapy (DOT) at Bellevue Hospital in New York City., RESULTS: From January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2009, 79 patients underwent court-ordered detention for TB treatment. Compared with patients completing treatment in DOT, univariate analysis found that detainees were younger; more likely to be of minority race/ethnicity; to have a history of substance abuse, tobacco use, homelessness, incarceration, HIV infection; and to be born in the United States. Multivariate analysis adjusting for other variables found smear positivity (OR = 3.93; 95% CI, 1.05-14.75; P = .04), mental illness (OR = 5.80; 95% CI, 1.18-28.51; P = .03), and substance abuse (OR = 9.25; 95% CI, 2.81-30.39; P < .01) to be the strongest independent predictors of likelihood of detention. Of those initially detained, 46 (58%) completed treatment during inpatient detention, 29(37%) completed treatment under outpatient court-ordered DOT, and four died during their hospitalization., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients undergoing court-ordered detention for TB treatment (95%) successfully completed therapy. Likelihood of detention was most strongly associated with factors expected to be associated with poor adherence, including mental illness and substance abuse.

N2  - Few community-based HIV interventions exist for Black men at heterosexual risk for HIV. None focus on structural HIV risks such as unemployment and unstable housing. This study involved a pilot evaluation of the MEN (Making Employment Needs) Count HIV intervention, a three session peer counselor-delivered program of HIV risk reduction and gender-equity counseling, and employment and housing case management. A single-arm intervention trial of MEN Count was conducted with Black men recruited from a community men's clinic and social services program. Eligible men were those who reported two or more sex partners in the past six months and current unemployment and/or recent homelessness. Most participants (68%) had a history of incarceration. Participants (N = 50) were surveyed on outcomes at baseline (Time 1), posttest (Time 2; 60-90 days after baseline), and two-month follow-up (Time 3). The majority of participants were retained in the program (86%) and the final follow-up survey (76%). McNemar tests revealed significant reductions in the past 30-day unprotected sex from Time 1 (74%) to Time 2 (47%) and to Time 3 (47%), and in homelessness from Time 1 (58%) to Time 3 (32%). Significant increases in employment from Time 1 (8%) to Time 2 (29%) and Time 3 (32%) were also seen. Participants completed a brief participant satisfaction survey at posttest. Most (n=28, 65%) rated the program as excellent, and an additional 10 (23%) rated it as good. Although there was no significant reduction in multiple sex partners, a trend was observed from Time 1 (56%) to Time 2 (44%) and Time 3 (42%). Findings suggest that the MEN Count model is a feasible and promising HIV prevention program for Black men at heterosexual risk for HIV. Larger scale implementation and more rigorous evaluation of MEN Count are needed to confirm the study findings.

N2  - BACKGROUND: One of the main priorities of Dutch organisations providing shelter services is to develop evidence-based interventions in the care for abused women and homeless people. To date, most of these organisations have not used specific intervention models and the interventions which have been implemented rarely have an empirical and theoretical foundation. The present studies aim to examine the effectiveness of critical time intervention (CTI) for abused women and homeless people., METHODS: In two multi-centre randomised controlled trials we investigate whether CTI, a time-limited (nine month) outreach intervention, is more effective than care-as-usual for abused women and homeless people making the transition from shelter facilities to supported or independent housing. Participants were recruited in 19 women's shelter facilities and 22 homeless shelter facilities across The Netherlands and randomly allocated to the intervention group (CTI) or the control group (care-as-usual). They were interviewed four times in nine months: once before leaving the shelter, and then at three, six and nine months after leaving the shelter. Quality of life (primary outcome for abused women) and recurrent loss of housing (primary outcome for homeless people) as well as secondary outcomes (e.g. care needs, self-esteem, loneliness, social support, substance use, psychological distress and service use) were assessed during the interviews. In addition, the model integrity of CTI was investigated during the data collection period., DISCUSSION: Based on international research CTI is expected to be an appropriate intervention for clients making the transition from institutional to community living. If CTI proves to be effective for abused women and homeless people, shelter services could include this case management model in their professional standards and improve the (quality of) services for clients., TRIAL REGISTRATION: NTR3463 and NTR3425.

N2  - This cross-sectional study assessed predictors of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) positivity with baseline data collected on recently released male parolees (N = 157) participating in a randomized trial focused on reduction of drug use, recidivism, and risk for hepatitis and HIV infections. In this sample, the prevalence of HCV was 25%. The logistic regression analysis revealed that being an injection drug user was significantly related to HCV infection. However, contrary to most of the current literature, being Black had significantly lower odds of contracting HCV than their White counterparts. Moreover, having lived on the streets, not being part of a close family in childhood, and being older were also associated with HCV infection. These findings highlight the need for skilled assessments that target the vulnerabilities of homeless adults, especially those who have been incarcerated. Understanding drug use patterns, childhood networks, and family relationships, may assist in the design of interventions to reduce risky drug use and address behaviors derived from disadvantaged childhood.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Although multiple social and behavioral risk factors associated with obesity co-occur among young children, most studies have examined them separately. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between social risk factors, behavioral problems, health behaviors, and obesity among preschoolers in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 1589)., METHODS: A cumulative social risk score was created by summing maternal reports of intimate partner violence, food insecurity, housing insecurity, maternal depressive symptoms, maternal substance use, and father's incarceration, obtained when the child was 3 years old. Mothers reported on the child's internalizing and externalizing behaviors with the Child Behavior Checklist at age 5 years. Mothers also reported on hours the child spent watching television and sleeping as well as servings of soda or juice drinks the child consumed per day. Child height and weight were measured at age 5 years. Obesity was defined as body mass index >= 95th percentile., RESULTS: In regression analyses adjusted for health behaviors, behavioral problems, and sociodemographic factors, cumulative social risk was associated with obesity among girls. Externalizing behavioral problems were associated with obesity among girls (prevalence ratios [PRs], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-1.7) and boys (PR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6). Short sleep duration was also associated with obesity among girls (PR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.4) and boys (PR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5) even after adjusting for behavioral problems and social risk factors. Watching more than 2 hours of television per day was associated with obesity among boys (PR 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9) but not girls., CONCLUSION: Co-occurring social and behavioral risk factors are associated with obesity among 5-year-old children.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although injection drug use is known to result in a range of health-related harms, including transmission of HIV and fatal overdose, little is known about the possible role of synthetic drugs in injection initiation. We sought to determine the effect of crystal methamphetamine use on risk of injection initiation among street-involved youth in a Canadian setting., METHODS: We used Cox regression analyses to identify predictors of injection initiation among injection-naive street-involved youth enrolled in the At-Risk Youth Study, a prospective cohort study of street-involved youth in Vancouver, British Columbia. Data on circumstances of first injection were also obtained., RESULTS: Between October 2005 and November 2010, a total of 395 drug injection-naive, street-involved youth provided 1434 observations, with 64 (16.2%) participants initiating injection drug use during the follow-up period, for a cumulative incidence of 21.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-41.7) per 100 person-years. In multivariable analysis, recent noninjection use of crystal methamphetamine was positively associated with subsequent injection initiation (adjusted hazard ratio 1.93, 95% CI 1.31-2.85). The drug of first injection was most commonly reported as crystal methamphetamine (14/31 [45%])., INTERPRETATION: Noninjection use of crystal methamphetamine predicted subsequent injection initiation, and crystal methamphetamine was the most commonly used drug at the time of first injection. Evidence-based strategies to prevent transition to injection drug use among crystal methamphetamine users are urgently needed.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Although participatory methods have become increasingly popular, people with lived experience of mental illness and homelessness have been historically excluded from service planning and research. To better plan for meaningful inclusion of consumers, this study examines lessons learned from the People with Lived Experience Caucus in the Toronto Site of the At Home/Chez Soi Research Demonstration Project on Homelessness and Mental Health., METHOD: The inclusion of the People with Lived Experience Caucus was evaluated using qualitative methods and multiple data sources, including review of 42 documents, 11 individual interviews, and three focus groups. Caucus members were included in the study team. Transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory methodology., RESULTS: Findings revealed a complex story of Caucus engagement: Facing time constraints and given little direction, the Caucus developed through a tumultuous process related to both internal and external barriers to meaningful inclusion. Despite the challenges, the Caucus contributed meaningfully to various aspects of the research demonstration project., CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It is possible to successfully integrate psychiatric consumers with experience of homelessness in many aspects of research and service planning. Suggestions for future initiatives hoping to engage consumers include: early involvement, purposeful selection of members, clear communication of roles and responsibilities, a consumer coordinating group, and space for critical dialog throughout the process. Lessons learned can inform the inclusion of consumers in similar endeavors in other jurisdictions. Copyright (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We assessed whether homeless adults entering substance abuse treatment in Massachusetts were less likely than others to enroll in Medicaid after implementation of the MassHealth Medicaid expansion program in 1997., METHODS: We used interrupted time-series analysis in data on substance abuse treatment admissions from the Treatment 0Episode Data Set (1992-2009) to evaluate Medicaid coverage rates in Massachusetts and to identify whether trends differed between homeless and housed participants. We also compared Massachusetts data with data from 17 other states and the District of Columbia combined., RESULTS: The percentage of both homeless and housed people entering treatment with Medicaid increased approximately 21% after expansion (P = .01), with an average increase of 5.4% per year over 12 years (P = .01). The increase in coverage was specific to Massachusetts, providing evidence that the MassHealth policy was the cause of this increase., CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide evidence in favor of state participation in the Medicaid expansion in January 2014 under the Affordable Care Act and suggest that hard-to-reach vulnerable groups such as substance-abusing homeless adults are as likely as other population groups to benefit from this policy.

N2  - Given high levels of health and psychological costs associated with the family disruption of homelessness, identifying predictors of runaway and homeless episodes is an important goal. The current study followed 179 substance abusing, shelter-recruited adolescents who participated in a randomized clinical trial. Predictors of runaway and homeless episodes were examined over a two year period. Results from the hierarchical linear modeling analysis showed that family cohesion and substance use, but not family conflict or depressive symptoms, delinquency, or school enrollment predicted future runaway and homeless episodes. Findings suggest that increasing family support, care and connection and reducing substance use are important targets of intervention efforts in preventing future runaway and homeless episodes amongst a high risk sample of adolescents.

N2  - We reviewed the literature on standard case management (SCM), intensive case management (ICM), assertive community treatment (ACT), and critical time intervention (CTI) for homeless adults. We searched databases for peer-reviewed English articles published from 1985 to 2011 and found 21 randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies comparing case management to other services. We found little evidence for the effectiveness of ICM. SCM improved housing stability, reduced substance use, and removed employment barriers for substance users. ACT improved housing stability and was cost-effective for mentally ill and dually diagnosed persons. CTI showed promise for housing, psychopathology, and substance use and was cost-effective for mentally ill persons. More research is needed on how case management can most effectively support rapid-rehousing approaches to homelessness.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Street-involved youth are at high risk for experimenting with injection drug use; however, little attention has been given to identifying the factors that predict progression to on-going injecting., METHODS: Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with progression to injecting weekly on a regular basis among a Canadian cohort of street-involved youth., RESULTS: Among our sample of 405 youth who had initiated injecting at baseline or during study observation, the median age was 22 years (interquartile range [IQR]=21-24), and 72% (293) reported becoming a regular injector at some point after their first injection experience. Of these, the majority (n=186, 63%) reported doing so within a month of initiating injection drug use. In multivariate analysis, the drug used at the first injection initiation event (opiates vs. cocaine vs. methamphetamine vs. other; all p>0.05) was not associated with progression; however, younger age at first injection (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.13), a history of childhood physical abuse (AOR=1.81), prior regular use of the drug first injected (AOR=1.77), and having a sexual partner present at the first injection event (AOR=2.65) independently predicted progression to regular injecting., CONCLUSION: These data highlight how quickly youth progress to become regular injectors after experimentation. Findings indicate that addressing childhood trauma and interventions such as evidence-based youth focused addiction treatment that could prevent or delay regular non-injection drug use, may reduce progression to regular injection drug use among this population.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of 3 theoretically distinct interventions among substance-abusing runaway adolescents and to explore individual differences in trajectories of change., METHOD: Adolescents (N = 179) between the ages of 12 and 17 were recruited from a runaway shelter in a midwestern city. The sample included 94 females (52.5%) and 85 males (47.5%); the majority of the adolescents were African American (n = 118, 65.9%). Adolescents were randomly assigned to the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA, n = 57), Motivational Interviewing (MI, n = 61), or Ecologically-Based Family Therapy (EBFT, n = 61). Substance use was assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months via Form 90 and urine screens., RESULTS: Hierarchical linear modeling revealed statistically significant improvement in frequency of substance use among runaways in all 3 treatment groups, with a slight increase at posttreatment. Latent trajectory profile analysis explored individual differences in change trajectories and yielded a 3-class model. The majority of adolescents (n = 136, 76%) showed reductions in substance use over time, with a slight increase at follow-up (Class 1: Decreasing). Twenty-four (13.4%) adolescents had shown high levels of substance use over time with patterns of increase and decrease (Class 2: Fluctuating high users), and 19 (10.6%) decreased but returned to baseline levels by 2 years postbaseline (Class 3: U shaped). Few differences among treatment conditions were noted; within the "decreasing" group, adolescents in MI treatment showed a quicker decline in their substance use but a faster relapse compared with those receiving EBFT., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CRA, EBFT, and MI are viable treatments for runaway substance-abusing adolescents.

N2  - This randomized pilot study tested the efficacy of an integrative treatment targeting homeless substance abusing mothers with young children in their care. Sixty mothers with 2-6 year old children were recruited from a local family shelter. The mothers were randomly assigned to Ecologically-Based Treatment (n=30) or treatment as usual (n=30). The intervention group received 3 months of rental and utility assistance up to $600 per month, case management services, and substance abuse counseling (referred to as supportive services). The treatment as usual group received housing and services through the family shelter and community housing programs. All participants completed follow-up assessments at 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Mothers receiving Ecologically-Based Treatment showed a quicker decline in alcohol frequency and a quicker increase in housing stability. Furthermore, with supportive services, two-thirds of women were successful in maintaining their apartments 6 months after rental assistance ended. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Numbers of street-connected children and young people run into many millions worldwide and include children and young people who live or work in street environments. Whether or not they remain connected to their families of origin, and despite many strengths and resiliencies, they are vulnerable to a range of risks and are excluded from mainstream social structures and opportunities., OBJECTIVES: To summarise the effectiveness of interventions for street-connected children and young people that promote inclusion and reintegration and reduce harms. To explore the processes of successful intervention and models of change in this area, and to understand how intervention effectiveness may vary in different contexts., SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following bibliographic databases, from inception to 2012, and various relevant non-governmental and organisational websites: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE and PreMEDLINE; EMBASE and EMBASE Classic; CINAHL; PsycINFO; ERIC; Sociological Abstracts; Social Services Abstracts; Social Work Abstracts; Healthstar; LILACS; System for Grey literature in Europe (OpenGrey); ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; EconLit; IDEAS Economics and Finance Research; JOLIS Library Catalog of the holdings of the World Bank Group and IMF Libraries; BLDS (British Library for Development Studies); Google, Google Scholar., SELECTION CRITERIA: The review included data from harm reduction or reintegration promotion intervention studies that used a comparison group study design and were all randomised or quasi-randomised studies. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions aimed to benefit street-connected children and young people, aged 0 to 24 years, in all contexts., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were extracted on intervention delivery, context, process factors, equity and outcomes. Outcome measures were grouped according to whether they measured psychosocial outcomes, risky sexual behaviours or substance use. A meta-analysis was conducted for some outcomes though it was not possible for all due to differences in measurements between studies. Other outcomes were evaluated narratively., MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 studies evaluating 12 interventions from high income countries. We did not find any sufficiently robust evaluations conducted in low and middle income countries (LMICs) despite the existence of many relevant programmes. Study quality overall was low to moderate and there was great variation in the measurement used by studies, making comparison difficult. Participants were drop-in and shelter based. We found no consistent results on a range of relevant outcomes within domains of psychosocial health, substance misuse and sexual risky behaviours despite the many measurements collected in the studies. The interventions being evaluated consisted of time limited therapeutically based programmes which did not prove more effective than standard shelter or drop-in services for most outcomes and in most studies. There were favourable changes from baseline in outcomes for most particpants in therapy interventions and also in standard services. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies and equity data were inconsistently reported. No study measured the primary outcome of reintegration or reported on adverse effects. The review discussion section included consideration of the relevance of the findings for LMIC settings., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Analysis across the included studies found no consistently significant benefit for the 'new' interventions compared to standard services for street-connected children and young people. These latter interventions, however, have not been rigorously evaluated, especially in the context of LMICs. Robustly evaluating the interventions would enable better recommendations to be made for service delivery. There is a need for future research in LMICs that includes children who are on the streets due to urbanisation, war or migration and who may be vulnerable to risks such as trafficking.

N2  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common among people with substance abuse histories and a burden for U.S. veterans in particular. This study compares self-reported HCV between 1,652 veterans and 48,013 nonveterans who received public-sector substance abuse treatment in Los Angeles between 2006 and 2010. A higher percentage of veterans than nonveterans reported HCV (6.5% vs. 3.8%, p < .0001). Homelessness and mental illness explained, respectively, 8.6% and 7.1% of the difference in HCV between the two groups, adjusting for other variables. Reducing homelessness and mental illness among veterans may also help reduce the excess burden of HCV in this population.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess the clinical and social outcomes for a cohort of patients who were part of the redevelopment of psychiatric services in British Columbia., METHOD: This study used a naturalistic, quasi-experimental design, to examine the outcomes of a cohort of 189 long-stay patients at Riverview Hospital (RVH), some of whom moved into Tertiary Psychiatric Residential Facilities (TPRFs), some into the community in less structured facilities, and some remained at RVH. Data was collected from clinical files at RVH and at each participating site, semi-structured interviews and self-report measures were completed with patients. In addition, semi-structured interviews were also conducted with staff members., RESULTS: There was very minimal evidence of transinstitutionalization to prisons or homelessness; one participant resided in a correctional facility, one resided in a forensic facility, and one participant spent some time homeless. In addition, the majority of participants remained in residences that provided 24h care. Eighty percent of our population was diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Psychiatric symptoms remained fairly stable; some embarrassing social behaviors increased; however, aggressive behaviors showed no increase; neuropsychological deficits did not deteriorate, there were even some improvements. Participants demonstrated increases in several independent living skills including: money management, food preparation and storage, job skills, and transportation skills. In addition, participants experienced a significant increase in their perceived quality of life., CONCLUSIONS: This study builds on existing research demonstrating that well-planned and appropriately resourced hospital closures can lead to positive psycho-social outcomes for participants and can successfully avoid negative outcomes such as transinstitutionalization to the judiciary system and homelessness.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the voice performance of children involved in street labor with regular children using perceptual-auditory and acoustic analyses., METHODS: A controlled cross-sectional study was carried out on 7- to 10-year-old children of both genders. Children from both groups lived with their families and attended school regularly; however, child labor was evident in one group and not the other. A total of 200 potentially eligible street children, assisted by the Child Labor Elimination Programme (PETI), and 400 regular children were interviewed. Those with any vocal discomfort (106, 53% and 90, 22.5%) had their voices assessed for resonance, pitch, loudness, speech rate, maximum phonation time, and other acoustic measurements., RESULTS: A total of 106 street children (study group [SG]) and 90 regular children (control group [CG]) were evaluated. The SG group demonstrated higher oral and nasal resonance, reduced loudness, a lower pitch, and a slower speech rate than the CG. The maximum phonation time, fundamental frequency, and upper harmonics were higher in the SG than the CG. Jitter and shimmer were higher in the CG than the SG., CONCLUSION: Using perceptual-auditory and acoustic analyses, we determined that there were differences in voice performance between the two groups, with street children having better quality perceptual and acoustic vocal parameters than regular children. We believe that this is due to the procedures and activities performed by the Child Labor Elimination Program (PETI), which helps children to cope with their living conditions.

N2  - PURPOSE: We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between social network characteristics and street youths' shelter use, a determinant of health outcomes for homeless youth., METHODS: We analyzed interview data from 138 street youth recruited through venue-based sampling in San Francisco, to assess the cross-sectional relationship between shelter use in youths' social networks and youths' reported shelter use. We also assessed the relationship between baseline network shelter use and shelter use at 6-month follow-up., RESULTS: Low proportions of street youth reported shelter use at baseline (38%) and follow-up (29.6%). Twenty-nine (26.9%) youth were in networks with shelter users at baseline, compared with 17 youth (15.7%) at follow-up. In cross-sectional analysis, youth in networks with shelter users had 5-fold increased odds of reporting shelter use (OR: 5.86, p = .006). A 1-person increase in the number of network shelter users was associated with 2-fold increased odds of youths' shelter use (OR: 2.16, p = .02). In longitudinal analysis, youth in networks with shelter users at baseline had nearly 5-fold increased odds of shelter use at follow-up (OR: 4.95, p = .01). A 1-person increase in the number of network shelter users at baseline was associated with 3-fold increased odds of shelter use at follow-up (OR: 3.15, p = .004)., CONCLUSION: Shelter users seem to cluster together. Shelter use by extended network members was associated with increased odds of youths' own shelter use. Understanding how network behaviors influence street youths' health-related behaviors, such as shelter use, could inform network-based interventions encouraging service uptake among marginalized and hard-to-reach street youth populations.

N2  - Thousands of street children of Manila are affected by early-in-life oral infection. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effectiveness of a sea-salt mouthrinse solution in street children of Manila affected by mild to severe forms of periodontal disease. These children were all in need of special protection: abandoned, abused, exploited, neglected, orphaned, poor. During 3 oral-health missions in 2003, 2004 and 2005, 617 abandoned children (5 to 13 year-old), received oral examination at a non-sectarian child-caring institution in Metro Manila (Virlanie Foundation) by calibrated examiners. A treatment based on what could be done was proposed: 1. Teaching of a precise tooth brushing technique with sea-salt, controlled and reinforced every two days for one week by calibrated health educators, 2. The application of sea-salt water mouthrinse (2.5 gram in 20 ml). Periodontal measurements were repeated at the end of each mission. All children returned to child-caring institution for the followup examinations. In 2003, 10 male and 11 female (n=21) were diagnosed with aggressive periodontitis. In 2009 and 2010, none was affected by aggressive periodontitis. For all patients, the gingival index decreased from 1.08 at the first mission to 1.04 at the end of the second mission and 0.98 at the end of the third mission. The periodontal index decreased from 1.33 at the first mission to 0.98 at the second mission and 0.92 at the last mission. The present investigation confirms that prevention and early diagnosis can result in success with minimum cost. The provided oral health program empowered street children in the most desperate circumstances to be educated and become self-reliant, independent, and responsible. We propose here an antimicrobial approach which has a high degree of efficacy and tolerability, and can be implemented in virtually all parts of the world using low-cost resources.

N2  - BACKGROUND: As medical homes are developing under health reform, little is known regarding depression services need and use by diverse safety-net populations in under-resourced communities. For chronic conditions like depression, primary care services may face new opportunities to partner with diverse community service providers, such as those in social service and substance abuse centers, to support a collaborative care model of treating depression., OBJECTIVE: To understand the distribution of need and current burden of services for depression in under-resourced, diverse communities in Los Angeles., DESIGN: Baseline phase of a participatory trial to improve depression services with data from client screening and follow-up surveys., PARTICIPANTS: Of 4,440 clients screened from 93 programs (primary care, mental health, substance abuse, homeless, social and other community services) in 50 agencies, 1,322 were depressed according to an eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) and gave contact information; 1,246 enrolled and 981 completed surveys. Ninety-three programs, including 17 primary care/public health, 18 mental health, 20 substance abuse, ten homeless services, and 28 social/other community services, participated., MAIN MEASURES: Comparisons by setting in 6-month retrospective recall of depression services use., KEY RESULTS: Depression prevalence ranged from 51.9 % in mental health to 17.2 % in social-community programs. Depressed clients used two settings on average to receive depression services; 82 % used any setting. More clients preferred counseling over medication for depression treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Need for depression care was high, and a broad range of agencies provide depression care. Although most participants had contact with primary care, most depression services occurred outside of primary care settings, emphasizing the need to coordinate and support the quality of community-based services across diverse community settings.

N2  - The aim of the present prospective observational study was to assess uptake and success of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment among a group of former and current injection drug users with chronic HCV infection at the Street Health Centre in Kingston, Ontario. The Street Health Centre offers hepatitis C education, assessment and treatment within a multidisciplinary, integrated and collaborative treatment model of care delivered by primary care professionals. The study enrolled a convenience sample of 34 patients. Seventy per cent of study patients had no postsecondary education, 85% were unemployed and one-third were unstably housed. A majority of study patients self-reported mental health problems. Of the 14 patients who initiated antiviral treatment in the study period, eight (57%) achieved sustained virological response. Regardless of virological outcome, patients who initiated treatment showed positive trends toward increased social and psychiatric stability, and decreases in high-risk behaviours. These results suggest that not only is successful treatment of chronic HCV infection in current and former injection drug users with concurrent psychiatric disorders possible, but the benefits of such treatment delivered in a community-based, multidisciplinary, primary care model may extend beyond narrowly defined virological outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We compared the characteristics of emergency department (ED) visits of older versus younger homeless adults., METHODS: We analyzed 2005-2009 data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, a nationally representative survey of visits to hospitals and EDs, and used sampling weights, strata, and clustering variables to obtain nationally representative estimates., RESULTS: The ED visits of homeless adults aged 50 years and older accounted for 36% of annual visits by homeless patients. Although demographic characteristics of ED visits were similar in older and younger homeless adults, clinical and health services characteristics differed. Older homeless adults had fewer discharge diagnoses related to psychiatric conditions (10% vs 20%; P = .002) and drug abuse (7% vs 15%; P = .003) but more diagnoses related to alcohol abuse (31% vs 23%; P = .03) and were more likely to arrive by ambulance (48% vs 36%; P = .02) and to be admitted to the hospital (20% vs 11%; P = .003). Conclusions . Older homeless adults' patterns of ED care differ from those of younger homeless adults. Health care systems need to account for these differences to meet the needs of the aging homeless population.

N2  - BACKGROUND: While homelessness among youth is a serious problem, there is little information about evidence-based interventions for homeless youth. In cooperation with professionals and youths, Wolf (2012) developed Houvast (Dutch for 'grip'): a strengths based method grounded in scientific and practice evidence. The main aim of Houvast is to improve the quality of life of homeless youths by focusing on their strengths, thus stimulating their capacity for autonomy and self-reliance., METHOD/DESIGN: The effectiveness and fidelity of Houvast will be tested in ten Dutch services for homeless youth which are randomly allocated to an intervention group (n = 5), or a control group which provides care as usual (n = 5). Measurements of both objective and subjective quality of life and secondary outcomes (mental and physical health, substance use, coping, resilience, psychological needs, care needs, working relationship with the professional and attainment of personal goals) will be conducted among homeless youths (n = 251). Youths in both groups will be interviewed by means of a structured interview at baseline, at time of ending care or after having received care for six months (T1) and at nine months after baseline (T2). Model fidelity will be tested around T1., DISCUSSION: This study is unique as it includes a large number of homeless youths who are followed for a period of nine months, and because it focuses on a strengths based approach. If the Houvast method proves to be effective in improving quality of life it will be the first evidence-based intervention for homeless youth., TRIAL REGISTRATION: [corrected] Netherlands Trail Register (NTR):NTR3254.

N2  - BACKGROUND: While research has suggested that exposure to environments where drug use is prevalent may be a key determinant of drug-related risk, little is known regarding the impact of such exposure on the initiation of illicit injection drug use. We assessed whether neighborhood of residence predicted rates of injecting initiation among a cohort of street-involved youth in Vancouver, British Columbia., METHODS: We followed street-involved injecting naive youth aged 14-26 and compared rates of injecting initiation between youth residing in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside (DTES) neighborhood (the site of a large street-based illicit drug market) to those living in other parts of the city. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were employed to determine whether residence in the DTES was independently associated with increased risk of initiation of injection drug use., RESULTS: Between September, 2005 and November, 2011, 422 injection-naive individuals were followed, among whom 77 initiated injecting for an incidence density of injecting of 10.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.0-18.8) per 100 person years. In a multivariate model, residence in the DTES was independently associated with initiating injection drug use (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]=2.16, 95% CI: 1.33-3.52, p=0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest neighborhood of residence affects the risk of initiation into injection drug use among street-involved youth. The development of prevention interventions should target high-risk neighborhoods where risk of initiating into injecting drug use may be greatest. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have assessed the temporal association between homelessness and injection drug use, and injection-related risk behavior., METHODS: Among a cohort of 1405 current and former injection drug users in follow-up from 2005 to 2009, we used random intercept models to assess the temporal association between homelessness and subsequent injection drug use, and to determine whether the association between homelessness and sustained injection drug use among active injectors differed from the association between homelessness and relapse among those who stopped injecting. We also assessed the association between homelessness and subsequent injection-related risk behavior among participants who injected drugs consecutively across two visits. Homelessness was categorized by duration: none, <1 month, and >=1 month., RESULTS: Homelessness was reported on at least one occasion by 532 (38%) participants. The relationship between homelessness and subsequent injection drug use was different for active injectors and those who stopped injecting. Among those who stopped injecting, homelessness was associated with relapse [<1 month: AOR=1.67, 95% CI (1.01, 2.74); >=1 month: AOR=1.34 95% CI (0.77, 2.33)]. Among active injectors, homelessness was not associated with sustained injection drug use [<1 month: AOR=1.03, 95% CI (0.71, 1.49); >=1 month: AOR=0.81 95% CI (0.56, 1.17)]. Among those injecting drugs across two consecutive visits, homelessness >=1 month was associated with subsequent injection-related risk behavior [AOR=1.61, 95% CI (1.06, 2.45)]., CONCLUSION: Homelessness appears to be associated with relapse and injection-related risk behavior. Strengthening policies and interventions that prevent homelessness may reduce injection drug use and injection-related risk behaviors. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The mental health of caregivers has been shown to be important for improving HIV prevention and treatment. Household food insecurity affects hundreds of millions of individuals in Sub-Saharan Africa, a region that experiences a disproportionate burden of the HIV pandemic. Both maternal HIV diagnosis and household food insecurity may be linked with maternal stress. This in turn may lead to unhealthy coping behaviors. We examined the independent associations of HIV, persistent household food insecurity and the synergistic effect of both on maternal stress., METHODS: Ghanaian women recruited prenatally from hospitals offering voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) were followed for 12 months after childbirth (N = 232). A locally adapted 7-item version of the US Household Food Security Survey Module was applied at four time points postpartum. We dichotomized participant households as being persistently food insecure (i.e., food insecure at each time point) or not (i.e., food secure at any time point). We dichotomized participant women as not perceiving vs. perceiving stress at 12 months postpartum in reference to the median sample score on the 4-item Cohen's stress scale. Binary multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the independent and interactive effects of maternal HIV and persistent household food insecurity on maternal stress., RESULTS: The proportion of HIV-positive women that lived in severe food insecure households increased over time. By contrast, the HIV-negative group living in severely food insecure households experienced a steady decline across time. HIV-infection (AOR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.29-4.12) and persistent household food insecurity (AOR = 3.55, 95% CI 1.13-11.13) were independently associated with maternal stress in a multivariate model. Being both HIV-positive and persistently food insecure strongly and synergistically increased the risk for maternal perceived stress (AOR = 15.35, 95% CI 1.90-124.14)., CONCLUSION: In agreement with syndemic theory there is a powerful synergism between maternal HIV diagnosis and household food insecurity on maternal stress. Comprehensive multi-dimensional intervention studies are needed to better understand how to reduce stress among HIV-positive women living in persistently food insecure households and how to reduce the likelihood of food insecurity in HIV-affected households in Sub-Saharan Africa.

N2  - In 2007, a national survey estimated to up to 800,000 the number of homeless individuals in France. Ten percent of them live constantly in the street; often very dissocialized and in precarious conditions. Thereby it remains difficult for homeless to have access to a medical and social support. In order to identify the medical and social needs of this population, we performed a one year observational prospective study in two reception centres in Perpignan. 629 (99%) out of 635 answers were analysed. The most represented age group is 39-49 years (29,2%) with an over-representation of males (82,7%). The most frequent pathologies are psychological distress (43,9% of requests, including anxious problems 23%, and sleep disturbances 24,4%). Medical affections represented 15,7% of the cases (mainly nutritional deficiency), and skin diseases 15,%. Addictive behaviour was frequent including tobacco (84%), alcohol (17%), and drug addiction (9%). 21,7% of this population had a regular work, and 97,8% with fixed term contracts, but 45,1% did not have any health cover 17,6% of homeless did not obtain any answer to their medical request (lack of suitable medicine, or an impossibility to pull out further tests in order). To solve some aspects of that problem, family doctor can rely on a medical and social network (PASS, MAO, ANPAA).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Numbers of street-connected children and young people run into many millions worldwide and include children and young people who live or work in street environments. Whether or not they remain connected to their families of origin, and despite many strengths and resiliencies, they are vulnerable to a range of risks and are excluded from mainstream social structures and opportunities., OBJECTIVES: To summarise the effectiveness of interventions for street-connected children and young people that promote inclusion and reintegration and reduce harms. To explore the processes of successful intervention and models of change in this area, and to understand how intervention effectiveness may vary in different contexts.., SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following bibliographic databases, from inception to 2012, and various relevant non-governmental and organisational websites: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE and PreMEDLINE; EMBASE and EMBASE Classic; CINAHL; PsycINFO; ERIC; Sociological Abstracts; Social Services Abstracts; Social Work Abstracts; Healthstar; LILACS; System for Grey literature in Europe (OpenGrey); ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; EconLit; IDEAS Economics and Finance Research; JOLIS Library Catalog of the holdings of the World Bank Group and IMF Libraries; BLDS (British Library for Development Studies); Google, Google Scholar., SELECTION CRITERIA: The review included data from harm reduction or reintegration promotion intervention studies that used a comparison group study design and were all randomised or quasi-randomised studies. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions aimed to benefit street-connected children and young people, aged 0 to 24 years, in all contexts., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were extracted on intervention delivery, context, process factors, equity and outcomes. Outcome measures were grouped according to whether they measured psychosocial outcomes, risky sexual behaviours or substance use. A meta-analysis was conducted for some outcomes though it was not possible for all due to differences in measurements between studies. Other outcomes were evaluated narratively., MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 studies evaluating 12 interventions from high income countries. We did not find any sufficiently robust evaluations conducted in low and middle income countries (LMICs) despite the existence of many relevant programmes. Study quality overall was low to moderate and there was great variation in the measurement used by studies, making comparison difficult. Participants were drop-in and shelter based. We found no consistent results on a range of relevant outcomes within domains of psychosocial health, substance misuse and sexual risky behaviours despite the many measurements collected in the studies. The interventions being evaluated consisted of time limited therapeutically based programmes which did not prove more effective than standard shelter or drop-in services for most outcomes and in most studies. There were favourable changes from baseline in outcomes for most particpants in therapy interventions and also in standard services. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies and equity data were inconsistently reported. No study measured the primary outcome of reintegration or reported on adverse effects. The review discussion section included consideration of the relevance of the findings for LMIC settings., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Analysis across the included studies found no consistently significant benefit for the 'new' interventions compared to standard services for street-connected children and young people. These latter interventions, however, have not been rigorously evaluated, especially in the context of LMICs. Robustly evaluating the interventions would enable better recommendations to be made for service delivery. There is a need for future research in LMICs that includes children who are on the streets due to urbanisation, war or migration and who may be vulnerable to risks such as trafficking.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This is one of three Cochrane reviews that examine the role of the telephone in HIV/AIDS services. Both in developed and developing countries there is a large proportion of people who do not know they are infected with HIV. Knowledge of one's own HIV serostatus is necessary to access HIV support, care and treatment and to prevent acquisition or further transmission of HIV. Using telephones instead of face-to-face or other means of HIV test results delivery could lead to more people receiving their HIV test results., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of telephone use for delivery of HIV test results and post-test counselling.To evaluate the effectiveness of delivering HIV test results by telephone, we were interested in whether they can increase the proportion of people who receive their HIV test results and the number of people knowing their HIV status., SEARCH METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PubMed Central, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health (CINAHL), WHOs The Global Health Library and Current Controlled Trials from 1980 to June 2011. We also searched grey literature sources such as Dissertation Abstracts International,CAB Direct Global Health, OpenSIGLE, The Healthcare Management Information Consortium, Google Scholar, Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, International AIDS Society and AEGIS Education Global Information System, and reference lists of relevant studies for this review., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials (qRCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series (ITS) studies comparing the effectiveness of telephone HIV test results notification and post-test counselling to face-to-face or other ways of HIV test result delivery in people regardless of their demographic characteristics and in all settings., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently searched, screened, assessed study quality and extracted data. A third reviewer resolved any disagreement., MAIN RESULTS: Out of 14 717 citations, only one study met the inclusion criteria; an RCT conducted on homeless and high-risk youth between September 1998 and October 1999 in Portland, United States. Participants (n=351) were offered counselling and oral HIV testing and were randomised into face-to-face (n=187 participants) and telephone (n=167) notification groups. The telephone notification group had the option of receiving HIV test results either by telephone or face-to-face. Overall, only 48% (n=168) of participants received their HIV test results and post-test counselling. Significantly more participants received their HIV test results in the telephone notification group compared to the face-to-face notification group; 58% (n=106) vs. 37% (n=62) (p < 0.001). In the telephone notification group, the majority of participants who received their HIV test results did so by telephone (88%, n=93). The study could not offer information about the effectiveness of telephone HIV test notification with HIV-positive participants because only two youth tested positive and both were assigned to the face-to-face notification group. The study had a high risk of bias., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found only one eligible study. Although this study showed the use of the telephone for HIV test results notification was more effective than face-to-face delivery, it had a high-risk of bias. The study was conducted about 13 years ago in a high-income country, on a high-risk population, with low HIV prevalence, and the applicability of its results to other settings and contexts is unclear. The study did not provide information about telephone HIV test results notification of HIV positive people since none of the intervention group participants were HIV positive. We found no information about the acceptability of the intervention to patients' and providers', its economic outcomes or potential adverse effects. There is a need for robust evidence from various settings on the effectiveness of telephone use for HIV test results notification.

N2  - PURPOSE: To explore differences and similarities in environmental, personal, and behavioral factors influencing eating behavior among low-income women of varying weight status., DESIGN: Focus groups (n = 16) were used to collect qualitative data. Quantitative data collected included demographic, lifestyle, and anthropometric (heights and weights)., SETTING: Community centers, libraries, and homeless shelters in low-income neighborhoods., PARTICIPANTS: Of the 83 participants, 58% were African-American, 28% were white, and the remainder were American Indian, Hispanic, or mixed race. A total of 35% of participants were lean/normal (body mass index <25 kg/m(2)) and 65% were overweight/obese (body mass index >25 kg/m(2))., METHOD: Focus group methodology was used to collect data on 83 participants. Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) provided the theoretical basis. Transcripts were analyzed using the open-coding method and comments between lean/normal and overweight/obese women were systematically compared., RESULTS: Focus group themes were food environment, aberrant eating behavior, health values, and beliefs. Differences in personal and behavioral factors were apparent between overweight/obese and lean/normal women, with the former group frequently discussing emotional eating, overeating, and stashing food, and the latter group communicating greater nutrition knowledge and describing regular physical activity. Both groups similarly expressed experiences with food insecurity and lived in low-income environments., CONCLUSION: For low-income women, personal and behavioral factors may modify the influence of their obesogenic food environment. Further research within the context of SCT should examine differences between lean/normal and overweight/obese women living in the same environment.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: A pilot baby clinic in a hostel for homeless families has been established to address the specific attachment and developmental needs of infants living in temporary accommodation. The aim of this study was to assess whether this clinic model was associated with more positive outcomes than mainstream community services in terms of infant development and parent-infant interactions., DESIGN: Parent-infant psychotherapy and health visiting services collaborated to develop a new model of baby clinic, which reconfigured the traditional clinic to give priority to infants' affective experiences in a therapeutic group setting. Outcomes for parent-infant dyads in a homeless hostel where this service model was applied were compared with outcomes for parents and infants in hostels, which did not have such a service., METHODS: Fifty-nine mother-baby dyads participated in evaluation, 30 in the intervention hostel group and 29 living in comparison hostels. Infant mental and motor development was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Interactions between the parents and infants were video-recorded and coded on the Coding Interactive Behaviour Scales., RESULTS: The indices of mental and motor development of infants in the intervention hostel were significantly improved over time in relation to infants in the comparison hostels. No significant differences were found in the quality of parent-infant interaction between the two groups over time., CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the service model may have positive benefits for infant development. The findings, study limitations, and clinical implications are discussed., PRACTITIONER POINTS: Parents and infants living in temporary accommodation represent a high-risk and hard-to-reach population. A new model of intervention, which combines universal infant health services with a therapeutic parent-infant group may be an effective means of supporting the emotional needs of hard-to-reach parents and infants.

N2  - The problem of waiting list attrition in addiction treatment programs is widespread, and homeless and marginally housed individuals are particularly susceptible. This naturalistic, retrospective study describes an intervention (Transitional Supportive Housing and Case Management) that effectively promoted treatment admission for this high-risk group above and beyond that which could be explained by certain pretreatment factors. The clinical records of 211 military veterans referred to intensive outpatient addiction treatment were reviewed for factors related to treatment program admission, including 3 interventions designed to prevent waiting list attrition. Chi-square tests evaluated univariate predictors of treatment entry, and a hierarchical binary logistic regression evaluated several variables simultaneously. Results showed that fewer than 50% of wait-listed patients achieved treatment admission. Univariate predictors of treatment entry were not having a current partner, having a legal problem, and having had past substance use disorder treatment. The logistic regression showed that patients who received the intervention were 4.5 times more likely to enter the treatment program, and individuals with a current legal problem were 2.5 times more likely to enter treatment. Participation in a weekly support group and/or contact with a psychiatric nurse practitioner did not increase the likelihood of program admission. It may be possible to enhance treatment entry for the homeless and marginally housed by providing case management and housing services. Future research is needed to determine how the individual-level factors predicting treatment entry in this study can be used to tailor other interventions to further address the problem of waiting list attrition.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Homeless persons experience excess mortality, but US-based studies on this topic are outdated or lack information about causes of death. To our knowledge, no studies have examined shifts in causes of death for this population over time., METHODS: We assessed all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates in a cohort of 28 033 adults 18 years or older who were seen at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2008. Deaths were identified through probabilistic linkage to the Massachusetts death occurrence files. We compared mortality rates in this cohort with rates in the 2003-2008 Massachusetts population and a 1988-1993 cohort of homeless adults in Boston using standardized rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals., RESULTS: A total of 1302 deaths occurred during 90 450 person-years of observation. Drug overdose (n = 219), cancer (n = 206), and heart disease (n = 203) were the major causes of death. Drug overdose accounted for one-third of deaths among adults younger than 45 years. Opioids were implicated in 81% of overdose deaths. Mortality rates were higher among whites than nonwhites. Compared with Massachusetts adults, mortality disparities were most pronounced among younger individuals, with rates about 9-fold higher in 25- to 44-year-olds and 4.5-fold higher in 45- to 64-year-olds. In comparison with 1988-1993 rates, reductions in deaths from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were offset by 3- and 2-fold increases in deaths owing to drug overdose and psychoactive substance use disorders, resulting in no significant difference in overall mortality., CONCLUSIONS: The all-cause mortality rate among homeless adults in Boston remains high and unchanged since 1988 to 1993 despite a major interim expansion in clinical services. Drug overdose has replaced HIV as the emerging epidemic. Interventions to reduce mortality in this population should include behavioral health integration into primary medical care, public health initiatives to prevent and reverse drug overdose, and social policy measures to end homelessness.

N2  - Turbulent social environments are associated with health and developmental risk, yet mechanisms have been understudied. Guided by a life course framework and stress theory, this study examined the association between turbulent life transitions (including frequent residential mobility, school transitions, family structure disruptions, and homelessness) and exposure to violence during adolescence and high school completion, mental health, and health risk behaviors in young adulthood. Participants (n = 4834) from the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort were followed prospectively from age 12-14 years for 10 years. We used structural equation models to investigate pathways between turbulence and cumulative exposure to violence (CEV), and high school completion, mental health, and health risk behaviors, while accounting for early life socio-demographics, family processes, and individual characteristics. Results indicated that turbulence index was associated with cumulative exposure to violence in adolescence. Both turbulence index and cumulative exposure to violence were positively associated with higher health risk behavior, poorer mental health, and inversely associated with high school completion. These findings highlight the importance of considering the cumulative impact of turbulent and adverse social environments when developing interventions to optimize health and developmental trajectory for adolescents transitioning into adulthood.

N2  - This study assesses the Urban Breakaway Project, a collaborative project offering a structured vacation in the countryside of the province of Quebec intended for homeless (or street) youths. The objective of this study was to document participants' perspectives regarding this project by examining their satisfaction, intention to change following their stay and perceived improvement with respect to their life situation. Another goal of this research was to investigate the relationship between satisfaction level and perceived improvement of participants. One hundred and seven individuals participated in the study, during Urban Breakaway's first year of operation. Satisfaction with the project, assessed with the global Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-3 score, revealed a positive relationship with global scores of perceived improvement, as measured by the Perceived Improvement Questionnaire [PIQ; r = 0.37 (67), 95% CI (0.15; 0.56)]. Regarding intention to change, the data indicated that 95% of participants had moderate-to-definite intentions to do something to change their lives. Participants reported an improvement for most items covered by the PIQ. They experienced the greatest changes in relation to mood, leisure, appetite, physical condition and self-esteem. Results indicate that the Urban Breakaway Project reaches not only street youths but also an older homeless population. Participants , regardless of their age, were found to be very satisfied with services obtained, and their satisfaction was significantly correlated with the perceived improvement in their situation. Qualitative data indicate that characteristics of the programme, such as the countryside setting, the focus on basic needs, the climate and the opportunity for socialisation, peer support (or belonging) and personal growth were appreciated.

N2  - Shelter-recruited adolescents are known to have high rates of substance abuse and co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. Many studies have documented these mental health concerns, but only a small number of studies have tested interventions that may be useful for ameliorating these vulnerabilities. The current study compared three empirically supported psychotherapy interventions, Motivational Interviewing (MI), the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA), and Ecologically-Based Family Therapy (EBFT) with 179 substance abusing runaway adolescents (47 % female, 74 % minority) and their primary caretaker recruited through a Midwestern runaway crisis shelter. Examining both child and primary caretaker reports, each treatment was associated with significant reductions in internalizing and externalizing behaviors to 24 months post-baseline. However, the trajectory of change differed among the treatments. Adolescents receiving MI showed a quicker reduction in internalizing and externalizing behaviors but also a quicker increase in these behaviors compared to adolescents receiving EBFT, who continued to evidence improvements to 24 months. The findings provide support for continued evaluation of these treatments for use with this vulnerable population of adolescents.

N2  - There is growing awareness of the role of stigma and discrimination in HIV prevention, testing, and medical care. Yet, few studies have examined the stigma associated with using illicit drugs. In the present study, we examined the relationship between social network characteristics, drug user stigma, and depression. Study participants were comprised of 340 individuals who reported cocaine, crack, and/or heroin use in the prior 6 months and were involved in an HIV prevention study. They were recruited through street outreach, referrals, and word of mouth in inner-city Baltimore, MD, USA. The stigma scale was comprised of eight items, such as "how much do you feel ashamed of using drugs?" Depression was assessed with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, using cutoffs of 16 and 20 or greater. In the bivariate analyses, gender, homelessness in the past 6 months, drug user stigma, larger size of drug network, and current use of heroin, cocaine, and crack were all significantly associated with high levels of depression, whereas in the multivariate analyses, only drug user stigma remained significantly associated with depression. The results of this study suggest that drug treatment providers and other professionals who provide services to drug users should consider developing trainings to address drug user stigma. These programs should focus on the attitudes and behaviors of health and service providers toward drug users, among drug users themselves, and among family members and others who provide social support to drug users.

N2  - Homeless gay and bisexual (G/B) young men have multiple risk factors that increase their risk of contracting hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This study used baseline information from structured instruments to assess correlates of knowledge to HIV and HBV infection from 267 young (18-39 year old) G/B active methamphetamine, cocaine, and crack-using homeless men enrolled in a longitudinal trial. The study is designed to reduce drug use and improve knowledge of hepatitis and HIV/AIDS in a community center in Hollywood, California. Regression modeling revealed that previous hepatitis education delivered to G/B men was associated with higher levels of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis knowledge. Moreover, higher HIV/AIDS knowledge was associated with combining sex and drinking alcohol. Associations with hepatitis B knowledge was found among G/B men who were engaging in sex while under the influence of marijuana, who were receiving support from non-drug users, and who had been homeless in the last 4 months. Although being informed about HIV/AIDS and hepatitis did not preclude risky sexual and drug use behavior, knowledge about the dangers of concurrent sex with substance use is important. As higher levels of knowledge of hepatitis was associated with more moderate drug use, early access to testing and teaching harm reduction strategies remain critical to reduce exposure and infection of HBV and HIV in this population.

N2  - Housing stability is a key component of rehabilitation for individuals with severe mental illnesses but remains a challenge for mental health service providers, particularly with young adults experiencing early mental health difficulties. The aim of this study is to explore perceptions of housing and home-leaving processes among young adults with emerging psychotic disorders and to compare it to the perceptions of young adults without psychotic disorders. A qualitative, grounded theory based, multiple case study was conducted among 52 adults aged 18-30 years old. Two core categories emerged in relation with perception of housing: choice/control over the residential environment, and housing opportunities over time. Difference between the groups include more coerced home-leaving for young adults with first-episode psychosis and low levels of choice, control and opportunities for a sub-group of participants living in group homes. The housing situation of young adults is analyzed and discussed from a systemic perspective.

N2  - In a prospective two-group pilot study of a convenient sample of 156 young adults, we assessed improvement in HIV cognitive and transmission knowledge, hepatitis knowledge, and mental health at six-month follow-up. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed higher six-month scores in total HIV/AIDS knowledge, HIV/AIDS cognitive knowledge, HIV transmission knowledge and HBV and HCV knowledge at 6 months in the Hepatitis Health Promotion (HHP) group compared to the Art Messaging (AM) group. Moreover, homeless young participants who reported having significant others in their lives, and excellent or very good health did better than their counterparts. Youth who were attempting to get their lives together had higher scores for all types of knowledge except HBV. Hallucinogen users had significantly worse scores on all knowledge measures than non-users. Lastly, the HHP group revealed an improvement in psychological well-being compared to the AM group.

N2  - Housing instability, a growing public health problem, may be an independent environmental risk factor for hypertension, but limited prospective data exist. We sought to determine the independent association of housing instability in early adulthood (year 5, 1990-1991) and incident hypertension over the subsequent 15 years of follow-up (years 7, 10, 15, and 20) in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study (N = 5,115). Because causes of inadequate housing and its effects on health are thought to vary by race and sex, we hypothesized that housing instability would exert a differential effect on incident hypertension by race and sex. At year 5, all CARDIA participants were asked about housing and those free of hypertension were analyzed (N = 4,342). We defined housing instability as living in overcrowded housing, moving frequently, or living doubled up. Of the 4,342 participants, 8.5 % were living in unstable housing. Across all participants, housing instability was not associated with incident hypertension (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1.1; 95 % CI, 0.9-1.5) after adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status, substance use, social factors, body mass index, and study site. However, the association varied by race and sex (p value for interaction, <0.001). Unstably housed white women had a hypertension incidence rate 4.7 times (IRR, 4.7; 95 % CI, 2.4-9.2) that of stably housed white women in adjusted analysis. There was no association among white men, black women, or black men. These findings suggest that housing instability may be a more important risk factor among white women, and may act independently or as a marker for other psychosocial stressors (e.g., stress from intimate partner violence) leading to development of hypertension. Studies that examine the role of these psychosocial stressors in development of hypertension risk among unstably housed white women are needed.

N2  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of food incentives on adherence to tuberculosis (TB) drug treatment among homeless patients with TB. Food packages were thus given as a part of directly observed therapy to 142 homeless patients with TB at a dispensary in Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation. In addition, a social worker provided the patients with information and legal assistance, for example help with internal passports. Among the 142 patients, 66 were included in the study at the dispensary during their entire treatment period, while 76 patients were included in the study during shorter periods mainly because of transfer to inpatient care. In the first group, 59% of the patients continued the TB drug treatment without interruption in contrast to 31% in a control group. In the second group, that is those studied during shorter periods, 95% continued the TB drug treatment without interruption while attached to the dispensary. Food was introduced in the TB programme of the City of St. Petersburg as a consequence of this study. In conclusion, it can be stated that the food incentive had a strong positive impact on the adherence to TB drug treatment among these socially marginalized patients. The social support contributed in all probability also to the positive results. Copyright © 2012 The Authors. Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences © 2012 Nordic College of Caring Science.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Understanding factors associated with heavy drinking among homeless youth is important for prevention efforts. Social networks are associated with drinking among homeless youth, and studies have called for attention to racial differences in networks that may affect drinking behavior. This study investigates differences in network characteristics by the racial background of homeless youth, and associations of network characteristics with heavy drinking. (Heavy drinking was defined as having five or more drinks of alcohol in a row within a couple of hours on at least one day within the past 30 days.), METHOD: A probability sample of 235 Black and White homeless youths ages 13-24 were interviewed in Los Angeles County. We used chi-square or one-way analysis of variance tests to examine network differences by race and logistic regressions to identify network correlates of heavy drinking among Black and White homeless youth., RESULTS: The networks of Black youth included significantly more relatives and students who attend school regularly, whereas the networks of White youth were more likely to include homeless persons, relatives who drink to intoxication, and peers who drink to intoxication. Having peers who drink heavily was significantly associated with heavy drinking only among White youth. For all homeless youth, having more students in the network who regularly attend school was associated with less risk of heavy drinking., CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to our knowledge to investigate racial differences in network characteristics and associations of network characteristics with heavy drinking among homeless youth. White homeless youth may benefit from interventions that reduce their ties with peers who drink. Enhancing ties to school-involved peers may be a promising intervention focus for both Black and White homeless youth.

T1  - Comparisons of substance abuse, high-risk sexual behavior and depressive symptoms among homeless youth with and without a history of foster care placement.

N2  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare prevalence of substance use, high-risk sexual behaviors, and depression symptoms between homeless youth with and without a history of foster care placement., BACKGROUND: Approximately 26,000 young persons exit foster care annually in the United States. Once they 'age out' of foster care, however, many young persons do not have access to comprehensive health care. They also are at risk for substance abuse, homelessness, or mental illness. Because persons with a history of foster care are at risk for negative psycho-social outcomes, it is unclear if these young people might be different than homeless youth without this history., DESIGN: The design is descriptive and cross-sectional., METHODS: A total of 156 homeless young persons, of whom 44 had a history of foster care placement, were recruited from a drop-in center that caters to homeless youth and young adults., RESULTS: The sample was majority male and white; ages were 16-25. Significantly higher proportion of homeless former foster youth used methamphetamine within the last six months compared to non-fostered homeless youth p = 0.03). Homeless former foster youth were significantly older (p = 0.02) and less educated (p = 0.02) than their homeless counterparts without a history of foster care placement. Prevalence of using tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, crack cocaine, and powder cocaine were similar for both groups. Although not significant, a higher proportion of homeless former foster youth reported trading sex for money or drugs compared to non-fostered, homeless youth (19% versus 12% [trading sex for money], and 26% versus 14% [trading sex for drugs], respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study show that, in general, homelessness is a negative outcome, irrespective of having a foster care history. However, those with that history need continued support when transitioning to independent living, such as access to health care, and encouragement to further their education., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is important that nurses, who serve homeless youth populations, conduct a risk assessment profile, in order to ascertain a history of foster care placement, link former foster youth to social service agencies that provide risk reduction/health promotion education, and advocate for stable housing.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol use, and in particular, binge drinking, and methamphetamine use is pervasive among homeless youth and remains a social pressure among this vulnerable population. However, there is no compelling evidence that specific interventions for reducing drug and alcohol use are effective for homeless youth., OBJECTIVES: This community-based participatory action pilot study assessed the impact of an intervention study focused on decreasing use of drugs and alcohol among a sample of homeless young adults (N= 154) visiting a drop-in site in Santa Monica, California. The two programs consisted of an HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis Health Promotion (HHP) program led by nurses and an Art Messaging (AM) program led by artists. Six-month follow-up data were obtained from 100 of these individuals., RESULTS: Findings revealed significant reductions in alcohol and marijuana use and binge drinking in both the HHP and AM programs. However, homeless youth in the HHP program reported additional reductions in methamphetamine, cocaine, and hallucinogen use at 6-month follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in drugs and alcohol are important as these substances are linked to HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, and other health risks in homeless youth., SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: The successful outcomes of the study intervention validate the utility of nurse-led and artistic health promotion strategies to decrease drug and alcohol use and other risky behaviors in homeless youth populations.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility and case detection rate of a geographic information systems (GIS)-based integrated community screening strategy for tuberculosis, syphilis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)., DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study of all participants presenting to geographic hot spot screenings in Wake County, North Carolina., METHODS: The residences of tuberculosis, HIV, and syphilis cases incident between 1/1/05-12/31/07 were mapped. Areas with high densities of all 3 diseases were designated "hot spots." Combined screening for tuberculosis, HIV, and syphilis were conducted at the hot spots; participants with positive tests were referred to the health department., RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Participants (N = 247) reported high-risk characteristics: 67% previously incarcerated, 40% had lived in a homeless shelter, and 29% had a history of crack cocaine use. However, 34% reported never having been tested for HIV, and 41% did not recall prior tuberculin skin testing. Screening identified 3% (8/240) of participants with HIV infection, 1% (3/239) with untreated syphilis, and 15% (36/234) with latent tuberculosis infection. Of the eight persons with HIV, one was newly diagnosed and co-infected with latent tuberculosis; he was treated for latent TB and linked to an HIV provider. Two other HIV-positive persons had fallen out of care, and as a result of the study were linked back into HIV clinics. Of 27 persons with latent tuberculosis offered therapy, nine initiated and three completed treatment. GIS-based screening can effectively penetrate populations with high disease burden and poor healthcare access. Linkage to care remains challenging and will require creative interventions to impact morbidity.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study assessed lifetime and current prevalence rates of mental disorders and concurrent mental and substance use disorders in a sample of homeless women. Current suicide risk and recent health service utilization were also examined in order to understand the complex mental health issues of this population and to inform the development of new treatment strategies that better meet their specific needs., METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 196 adult homeless women in three different Canadian cities was done. Participants were assessed using DSM-IV-based structured clinical interviews. Current diagnoses were compared to available mental health prevalence rates in the Canadian female general population., RESULTS: Current prevalence rates were 63% for any mental disorder, excluding substance use disorders; 17% for depressive episode; 10% for manic episode; 7% for psychotic disorder; 39% for anxiety disorders, 28% for posttraumatic stress disorder; and 19% for obsessive-compulsive disorder; 58% had concurrent substance dependence and mental disorders. Lifetime prevalence rates were notably higher. Current moderate or high suicide risk was found in 22% of the women. Participants used a variety of health services, especially emergency rooms, general practitioners, and walk-in clinics., CONCLUSION: Prevalence rates of mental disorders among homeless participants were substantially higher than among women from the general Canadian population. The percentage of participants with moderate or high suicide risk and concurrent disorders indicates a high severity of mental health symptomatology. Treatment and housing programs need to be accompanied by multidisciplinary, specialized interventions that account for high rates of complex mental health conditions.

N2  - We described the distribution of risk factors for cardiovascular disease among homeless people living in the city of Porto, Portugal. Comparisons were made between subsamples of homeless people recruited in different settings and between the overall homeless sample group and a sample of the general population. All "houseless" individuals attending one of two homeless hostels or two institutions providing meal programs on specific days were invited to participate and were matched with subjects from the general population. We estimated sex, age and education-adjusted prevalence ratios or mean differences. The prevalence of previous illicit drug consumption and imprisonment was almost twice as high among the homeless from institutions providing meal programs. This group also showed lower mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Prevalence of smoking was almost 50% higher in the overall homeless group. Mean body mass index and waist circumference were also lower in the homeless group and its members were almost five times less likely to report dyslipidemia. Our findings contribute to defining priorities for interventions directed at this segment of society and to reducing inequalities in this extremely underprivileged population.

N2  - The aim of this pilot study was to assess the effectiveness of buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NX) among marginalized, opioid-dependent individuals in terms of retention in and cycling into and out of a harm-reduction program. This pilot study enrolled 100 participants and followed them from November 2005 to July 2008. The overall proportion of patients retained in the program at the end of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months was 68%, 63%, 56%, and 42%, respectively. This pilot study demonstrated that BUP/NX could be successfully used to treat marginalized heroin users.

Nonetheless, affirmations that sensory and cognitive abnormalities are present are a matter of controversy. The aim of this study was to investigate aspects to auditory processing, through applying the brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) and behavioral auditory processing tests to children living on the streets, and comparison with a control group., DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study in the Laboratory of Auditory Processing, School of Medicine, Universidade de Sao Paulo., METHODS: The auditory processing tests were applied to a group of 27 individuals, subdivided into 11 children (7 to 10 years old) and 16 adolescents (11 to 16 years old), of both sexes, in situations of social vulnerability, compared with an age-matched control group of 10 children and 11 adolescents without complaints. The BAEP test was also applied to investigate the integrity of the auditory pathway., RESULTS: For both children and adolescents, there were significant differences between the study and control groups in most of the tests applied, with significantly worse performance in the study group, except in the pediatric speech intelligibility test. Only one child had an abnormal result in the BAEP test., CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the study group (children and adolescents) presented poor performance in the behavioral auditory processing tests, despite their unaltered auditory brainstem pathways, as shown by their normal results in the BAEP test.

N2  - Runaway and homeless youth face multiple challenges to their health and experience inadequate access to health care services. This article describes a web-based personal health information system (PHIS) called Healthshack that was specifically designed to improve health care access and health outcomes for runaway and homeless youth at a community-based agency that served homeless youth and young adults up to age 24. The program was developed in partnership with homeless youth and piloted by public health nurses. Preliminary findings from the program indicate that a PHIS is acceptable to runaway and homeless youth and feasible to incorporate into the flow of a youth agency. Thus, a PHIS may be an innovative model of service delivery for other marginalized populations. Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To describe pathways taken to care by a sample of patients in a secure forensic unit who have been found not criminally responsible or unfit to stand trial, and to investigate the pathways taken by patients within 3 ethnoracial subgroups of origin: European, African or Caribbean, and Other., METHOD: Fifty patients from secure forensic units were interviewed using the Encounter Form developed for pathways mapping undertaken in the World Health Organization field trials. Differences in the types of caregivers seen, the total number of caregivers seen, and the time taken to reach forensic psychiatric services were compared across the 3 ethnoracial groupings., RESULTS: Most people committed their index offence after they had already had contact with general mental health services. Few significant differences were observed in the pathways to secure forensic units across the European, African-Caribbean, and Other ethnoracial groups., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that improvements in general mental health services may be a key to decreasing the use of forensic psychiatric services. Further research is required to explore factors that may predict and prevent offending. Larger studies are needed to examine ethnoracial differences in pathways to care.

T1  - Intervention for homeless, substance abusing mothers: findings from a non-randomized pilot.

N2  - Little empirically-based information is available regarding how best to intervene with substance-abusing homeless mothers. This study pilot-tested a comprehensive intervention with 15 homeless women and their 2- to 6-year-old children, recruited from a local family shelter. All participants were offered integrated intervention with three major components. The first component was housing which included 3 months of rental and utility assistance, and these services were not contingent upon women's abstinence from drugs or alcohol. The second and third components included 6 months of case management services and an evidence-based substance abuse treatment (Community Reinforcement Approach; CRA). Analysis revealed that women showed reductions in substance use (F(2,22) = 3.63; p < .05), homelessness (F(2,24) = 25.31; p < .001), and mental health problems (F(2,20) = 8.5; p < .01). Further, women reported reduced internalizing (F(2,22) = 4.08; p < .05) and externalizing problems (F(2,24) = 7.7; p = .01) among their children. The findings suggest that the intervention is a promising approach to meet the multiple needs of this vulnerable population. These positive outcomes support the need for future research to replicate the findings with a larger sample using a randomized design.

N2  - Molecular genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has proved to be a powerful tool in tuberculosis surveillance, epidemiology, and control. Based on results obtained through 15 years of nationwide IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) genotyping of M. tuberculosis cases in Denmark, a country on the way toward tuberculosis elimination, we discuss M. tuberculosis transmission dynamics and point to areas for control interventions. Cases with 100% identical genotypes (RFLP patterns) were defined as clustered, and a cluster was defined as cases with an identical genotype. Of 4,601 included cases, corresponding to 76% of reported and 97% of culture-verified tuberculosis cases in the country, 56% were clustered, of which 69% were Danes. Generally, Danes were more often in large clusters (>= 50 persons), older (mean age, 45 years), and male (male/female ratio, 2.5). Also, Danes had a higher cluster frequency within a 2-year observation window (60.8%), and higher clustering rate of new patterns over time, compared to immigrants. A dominant genotype, cluster 2, constituted 44% of all clustered and 35% of all genotyped cases. This cluster was primarily found among Danish males, 30 to 59 years of age, often socially marginalized, and with records of alcohol abuse. In Danes, cluster 2 alone was responsible for the high cluster frequency level. Immigrants had a higher incidence of clustered tuberculosis at a younger age (0 to 39 years). To achieve tuberculosis elimination in Denmark, high-risk transmission environments, like the cluster 2 environment in Danes, and specific transmission chains in immigrants in the capital area, e.g., homeless/socially marginalized Somalis/Greenlanders, often with alcohol abuse, must be targeted, including groups with a high risk of reactivation.

N2  - Urban transgender women often experience several sociocultural co-factors which contribute to their risk of HIV infection. A transgender-specific HIV Prevention Case Management (PCM) intervention was implemented in a community HIV prevention setting and targeted reducing sex work and homelessness, increasing legal employment and income, and reducing psychological and emotional distress symptoms. Sixty high-risk transgender women were enrolled in the ten-session PCM intervention. Participants completed approximately nine out of the ten sessions (M = 8.7; SD = 2.6) and six-month follow-up evaluations were completed with 97% of the participants. Findings from baseline to follow-up evaluations demonstrated a decrease in homelessness (31.0% vs. 10.3%, p<0.01), less reliance on exchange sex as a primary source of income (41.4% vs. 22.4%, p < 0.05), and significant decreases in symptom complaints across multiple Brief Symptom Inventory sub-scales, including depression, hostility, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism (all significant at p<0.05). Further, socioeconomic improvements following the intervention were significantly associated with psychological and emotional gains. The study suggests that adding a culturally appropriate PCM intervention in a community setting is beneficial in addressing co-factors for HIV infection as well as psychological and emotional distress symptoms among this extremely high-risk population.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Despite stereotypes of the homeless population as underweight, the literature lacks a rigorous analysis of weight status in homeless adults. The purpose of this study is to present the body mass index (BMI) distribution in a large adult homeless population and to compare this distribution to the non-homeless population in the United States. Demographic, BMI, and socioeconomic variables from patients seen in 2007-2008 were collected from the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP). This population was compared to non-homeless adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Among 5,632 homeless adults, the mean BMI was 28.4 kg/m(2) and the prevalence of obesity was 32.3 %. Only 1.6 % of homeless adults were underweight. Compared to mean BMI in NHANES (28.6 kg/m(2)), the difference was not significant in unadjusted analysis (p = 0.14). Adjusted analyses predicting BMI or likelihood of obesity also showed that the homeless had a weight distribution not statistically different from the general population. Although underweight has been traditionally associated with homelessness, this study suggests that obesity may be the new malnutrition of the homeless in the United States.

N2  - CONTEXT: Review of routinely collected tuberculosis genotyping results following a known outbreak is a potential mechanism to examine the effectiveness of outbreak control measures., OBJECTIVE: To assess differences in characteristics between outbreak and postoutbreak tuberculosis cases., DESIGN: Retrospective., SETTING: United States., PARTICIPANTS: All tuberculosis cases identified as a result of >5-person outbreaks investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during 2003 to 2007 (original outbreak cases), and subsequent culture-positive tuberculosis cases with matching Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypes reported in the same county during 2004 to 2008 (postoutbreak cases)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of demographic, social, and clinical characteristics of tuberculosis outbreak cases compared to postoutbreak cases. SECONDARY: Proportion of demographic, social, and clinical characteristics of epidemiologically linked versus nonlinked cases., RESULTS: Six outbreaks with 111 outbreak cases and 110 postoutbreak cases were identified. Differences between outbreak and postoutbreak cases were gender (69% vs 85% male; P < .01), birth origin (3% vs 11% foreign-born; P = .02), disease severity (48% vs 62% sputum smear-positive; P = .04), homelessness (38% vs 51%; P = .05), and injection drug use (4% vs 11%; P = .04). For 5 of the 6 outbreaks, the status of epidemiologic relationships among postoutbreak cases was available (n = 89). The postoutbreak cases with a known epidemiologic link to the original outbreak were in younger persons (aged 39 vs 47 years; P < .01), and a larger proportion reported injection drug use (18% vs 4%; P = .04) or noninjection drug use (44% vs 18%; P < .01) than those without a reported link., CONCLUSIONS: Health jurisdictions can utilize genotyping data to monitor and define the characteristics of postoutbreak cases related to the original outbreak.

T1  - Exploring the role of the internet in juvenile prostitution cases coming to the attention of law enforcement.

N2  - This exploratory analysis examines the role of the Internet in juvenile prostitution cases coming to the attention of law enforcement. The National Juvenile Prostitution Study (N-JPS) collected information from a national sample of law enforcement agencies about the characteristics of juvenile prostitution cases. In comparison to non-Internet juvenile prostitution cases, Internet juvenile prostitution cases involved younger juveniles and police were more likely to treat juveniles as victims rather than offenders. In addition, these cases were significantly more likely to involve a family or acquaintance exploiter. This analysis suggests that the role of the Internet may impact legal and social service response to juveniles involved in prostitution. In addition, it highlights the need for interventions that acknowledge the vulnerabilities of youth involved in this type of commercial sexual exploitation.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - This study aimed to establish a profile of users of the mental health service for homeless in Cork, comparing this group with those attending a General Adult Service. The homeless group were significantly more likely to be male (89% v. 46%o), unemployed (96% v. 68%), unmarried (98% v. 75%) and under 65 (94% v. 83%). Diagnostically, there was a significantly higher prevalence of schizophrenia (50% v. 34%); personality disorder (37% v. 11%) and substance dependence (74% v. 19%) in the homeless service users. They were more likely to have a history of deliberate self harm (54% v. 21%) and violence (48% v. 10%). Severe mental illness has a high prevalence in the homeless population, with particularly high levels of factors associated with suicide and homicide. Poor compliance and complexity of illness lead to a requirement for significant input from multidisciplinary mental health teams members.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Despite substantial health disadvantage, few intervention studies have examined ways to deliver smoking cessation support to homeless people. This proof-of-concept study explored the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, low-cost, telephone-delivered program., DESIGN AND METHODS: Clients aged over 18 years, English-speaking and currently receiving accommodation support from a homelessness outreach centre were invited to participate in a 'Phone for Health' program. Six sessions conducted once per week provided participants with personalised counselling about smoking cessation or reduction, as well as fruit and vegetable consumption, alcohol use, physical activity and sun protection. Both clients and staff completed follow-up quantitative surveys, and clients completed qualitative interviews., RESULTS: Of 14 eligible participants, 12 consented to taking part and completed baseline measures, 10 commenced the telephone intervention and six completed the intervention program. Average length of telephone sessions was 17.8 min and participants completed an average of 3.8 sessions. Findings suggested high acceptability with most participants reporting that the Phone for Health program helped them meet their smoking reduction goals, and was convenient, useful and practical. Most participants reported making changes to their health risk behaviours as a result of taking part in the program., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Telephone delivery of the smoking cessation and other health behaviours intervention was acceptable and feasible. The results provide pragmatic lessons for the development of future health research and practice with an underserved population markedly difficult to reach and engage.

N2  - PURPOSE: We evaluate the efficacy of a short family intervention in reducing sexual risk behavior, drug use, and delinquent behaviors among homeless youth., METHODS: A randomized controlled trial of 151 families with a homeless adolescent aged 12 to 17 years. Between March 2006 and June 2009, adolescents were recruited from diverse sites in Southern California and were assessed at recruitment (baseline), and at 3, 6, and 12 months later. Families were randomly assigned to an intervention condition with five weekly home-based intervention sessions or a control condition (standard care). Main outcome measures reflect self-reported sexual risk behavior, substance use, and delinquent behaviors over the past 90 days., RESULTS: Sexual risk behavior (e.g., mean number of partners; p < .001), alcohol use (p = .003), hard drug use (p < .001), and delinquent behaviors (p = .001) decreased significantly more during 12 months in the intervention condition compared with the control condition. Marijuana use, however, significantly increased in the intervention condition compared with the control condition (p < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: An intervention to reengage families of homeless youth has significant benefits in reducing risk over 12 months.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To identify factors distinguishing adolescents across 3 groups: no self-harm, nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) only, and NSSI and suicide attempt (NSSI + SA)., METHODS: Data were from the 2007 Minnesota Student Survey. The sample included 61,330 students in grades 9 and 12. Logistic regression analysis determined factors that best distinguished adolescents who reported NSSI from those who reported no self-harm, and adolescents who reported NSSI + SA. Final models were developed over 3 stages of analysis that tested the importance of variables within risk factor, protective factor, and co-occurring health-risk behavior domains., RESULTS: For male and female subjects, factors that consistently distinguished youth who reported NSSI from those who reported no self-harm included depressive symptoms, hopelessness, physical abuse, less parent connectedness, running away from home, and maladaptive dieting behavior. Factors that distinguished the NSSI + SA group from the NSSI only group for both sexes were a mental health problem, depressive symptoms, hopelessness, physical abuse, and running away from home. Other factors, such as sexual abuse, were significant in models for males or females only. Hopelessness constituted the leading factor to increase the likelihood that youth who self-injured also attempted suicide., CONCLUSIONS: Youth engaging in NSSI experience diverse psychosocial stressors and significant distress. Clinicians and school personnel are well-positioned to offer support to these youth. Furthermore, they can help address NSSI among youth by identifying those who self-injure early, assessing for hopelessness and suicidality, facilitating connections to prosocial adults, addressing maladaptive dieting behavior, and supporting runaway youth.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The important increase in immigration during recent years has changed the epidemiology and control strategies for tuberculosis (TB) in many places. This study evaluates the effectiveness of intervention with community health workers (CHW) to improve contact tracing among immigrants., METHODS: The study included all TB cases detected by the Barcelona TB Program from 2000 to 2005 and compared a period without CHW intervention (2000-2002) to a period with CHW intervention (2003-2005). The influence on contact tracing of sex, age, hospital of diagnosis, district of residence, birthplace, HIV, homeless and CHW intervention was analysed by logistic regression. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated., RESULTS: 960 foreign born TB cases were detected, 388 in the intervention period. Contact tracing was performed on 65,7% of 201 smear-positive cases during the pre-intervention period compared to 81.6% of 152 smear-positive TB cases during the intervention period (p < 0.001). Risk factors associated with incomplete contact tracing of smear-positive index cases included being diagnosed in two hospitals without contact tracing TB unit (OR = 3.5; CI:1.4-8.9) and (OR = 4.6; CI:1.6-13.5) respectively, birth place in India-Pakistan (OR = 4.4; CI:1.9-10.3) or North Africa (OR = 4.3; CI:1.8-10.5), having an unknown residence (OR = 5.4; CI:1.6-18.0), being HIV-infected (OR = 6.1; CI:2.5-14.8) or homeless (OR = 3.3; CI:1.3-8.2), and the absence of CHW intervention (OR = 2.4; CI:1.3-4.3)., CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of contact tracing for TB control in areas with high immigration can be improved by incorporating CHWs who act as translators, cultural mediators and facilitators who accompany cases and contacts through treatment and follow-up.

N2  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination rates for incarcerated adults remain low despite their high risk for infection. This study determined predictors of vaccine completion in homeless adults (N= 297) who reported histories of incarceration and who participated in one of three nurse-led hepatitis programs of different intensity. Moreover time since release from incarceration was also considered. Just over half of the former prisoners completed the vaccine series. Older age (>=40), having a partner, and chronic homelessness were associated with vaccine completion. Recent research has documented the difficulty in providing vaccine services to younger homeless persons and homeless males at risk for HBV. Additional strategies are needed to achieve HBV vaccination completion rates greater than 50% for formerly incarcerated homeless men. Copyright © 2012 International Association of Forensic Nurses.

N2  - AIMS: To describe and compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among homeless persons with a general population sample in Stockholm County, 2006, and to analyse the importance of certain social determinants of health among the homeless., METHODS: Face-to-face interviews with 155 homeless persons and a postal survey to a general population sample, mainly based on the same questionnaire, including questions on social determinants of health and HRQoL measured with the EQ-5D., RESULTS: Chronic illness was three times more common among the homeless. HRQoL was worse among homeless persons than in the general population sample: the homeless reported more problems, especially more severe problems, in all the EQ-5D dimensions and had considerably lower EQ-5D(index) and EQ(VAS) score than the general population. Most problems were reported in the dimension anxiety/depression. Among the homeless, longer duration and more severe degree of homelessness lowered HRQoL, but few determinants were statistically significantly related to HRQoL. Having mental disease significantly lowered HRQoL., CONCLUSIONS: This study was an attempt to include hard-to-reach groups in an assessment of population health. Homeless persons had considerably worse HRQoL than the general population and reported most problems in the dimension anxiety/depression. Some diseases may contribute to causing homelessness; others may be seen as consequences. Homeless persons are a vulnerable group in society. Further interview studies are needed based on larger sample of homeless persons to explore health determinants such as sex, age, socioeconomic factors, duration and degree of homelessness, and health-related behaviours among the homeless persons.

T1  - Impact of housing and work supports on outcomes for chronically homeless adults with mental illness: LA's HOPE.
A1  - Burt, Martha R
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the impact of a federally funded housing and employment demonstration program (Los Angeles' Homeless Opportunity Providing Employment [LA's HOPE]) for homeless adults with mental illness., METHODS: The sample included all participants enrolled between July 1, 2004, and May 17, 2005, in one of 18 Los Angeles County community mental health centers offering a state-funded program (AB2034) to reduce homelessness among people with serious mental illness. Fifty-six demonstration clients enrolled in three centers received housing and special employment supports. Their outcomes were compared with those of 415 clients enrolled in the county's other 15 AB2034 programs during the same period. Data included demographic characteristics, circumstances at enrollment and in the previous 12 months, and outcomes for at least 13 months after enrollment. Outcomes analyses used propensity score matching., RESULTS: Demonstration clients got and kept housing and worked in paid employment and employment-related activities at rates significantly higher than those of the comparison group. Other than client group, no personal characteristics made any systematic difference to employment outcomes. Several personal characteristics-race and ethnicity, preenrollment length of homelessness, and whether the client had a co-occurring substance use disorder-affected housing outcomes independently of client group., CONCLUSIONS: The demonstration provided the structure and resources to help clients achieve better housing and employment outcomes than the comparison group had. The outcomes for LA's HOPE clients suggest that this very challenged population can achieve improved work outcomes if programs devote adequate and appropriate resources to help them.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patient adherence to medications, particularly for conditions requiring prolonged treatment such as tuberculosis, is frequently less than ideal, and can result in poor treatment outcomes. Material incentives (given as cash, vouchers and tokens), have been used to improve adherence., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of material incentives in people undergoing diagnostic testing, or receiving prophylactic or curative therapy, for tuberculosis., SEARCH METHODS: We undertook a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; Science Citation Index; and reference lists of relevant publications; to 22 June 2011., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials of material incentives in patients being investigated for tuberculosis, or on treatment for latent or active disease., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two authors independently screened and selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. The effects of interventions are compared using risk ratios (RR), and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE., MAIN RESULTS: We identified 11 eligible studies. Ten were conducted in the USA: in adolescents (one trial), in injection drug or cocaine users (four trials), in homeless adults (three trials), and in prisoners (two trials). One additional trial recruited malnourished men receiving active treatment for tuberculosis in Timor-Leste.Material incentives may increase the return rate for reading of tuberculin skin test results compared to normal care (two trials, 1371 participants: RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.29, low quality evidence). Similarly, incentives probably improve clinic re-attendance for initiation or continuation of antituberculosis prophylaxis (three trials, 595 participants: RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.96, moderate quality evidence), and may improve subsequent completion of prophylaxis in some settings (three trials, 869 participants: RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 4.58, low quality evidence). We currently don't know if incentives can improve long-term adherence and completion of antituberculosis treatment for active disease. Only one trial has assessed this and the incentive, given as a daily hot meal, was not well received by the population due to the inconvenience of attending the clinic at midday (one trial, 265 participants, RR 0.98, 95%CI 0.86 to 1.12, very low quality evidence). Several trials have compared different forms or levels of incentive. These comparisons remain limited to single trials and robust conclusions cannot be made. In summary, cash incentives may be more effective than non-cash incentives (return for test results: one trial, 651 participants: RR 1.13, 95%CI 1.07 to 1.19, low quality evidence, adherence to tuberculosis prophylaxis: one trial, 141 participants: RR 1.26, 95%CI 1.02 to 1.56, low quality evidence) and higher amounts of cash may be more effective than lower amounts (return for test results: one trial, 404 participants: RR 1.08, 95%CI 1.01 to 1.16, low quality evidence). Material incentives may also be more effective than motivational education at improving return for tuberculin skin test results (low quality evidence), but may be no more effective than peer counselling, or structured education at improving continuation or completion of prophylaxis (low quality evidence)., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence to support the use of material incentives to improve return rates for tuberculosis diagnostic test results and adherence to antituberculosis preventive therapy. The data are currently limited to trials among predominantly male drug users, homeless, and prisoner subpopulations in the USA, and therefore the results are not easily generalised to the wider adult population, or to low- and middle-income countries, where the tuberculosis burden is highest.Further high-quality studies are needed to assess both the costs and effectiveness of incentives to improve adherence to long-term treatment of tuberculosis.

N2  - CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Since their creation in 2005 in France, mobile mental health outreach teams (EMPP) have been working to improve the health of the homeless who, for 30 to 50% of them, present severe mental disorders. Their missions are defined by ministerial circular's specifications. Few studies have been undertaken in France to analyze the practices of these teams' professionals, nor the characteristics of the populations with whom they are involved. The EMPP described in this paper had in 2010 a greater staff than other French EMPPs. It has 15 full-time staff, including four doctors (two psychiatrists, one GP, one house physician), two nurses, two educators, one social worker, three peer-workers, one secretary and two coordinators. The article analyzes the way of support developed within the range of EMPP's missions defined by the ministerial circular., METHODS: Descriptive statistical analysis was carried out using standardized data from four different sources (round sheet, record of activity, record of hospitalization, housing information, interviews conducted by medical and social professionals with patients). Another source of data consists of records describing the operation of the team (reference framework) and annual activities (annual report)., RESULTS: The method of care was developed based on a street working, involving a full medical and its relationship with the hospital and a place to live in a semi-community context. The Mobile Mental Health Outreach team documented 318 rounds in 2010, describing 666 contacts among whom 87.9% were followed regularly thereafter. It focuses to a target population. The team actively followed 198 people including 161 for whom a psychiatric diagnosis was done: 48.5% of the patients followed presented schizophrenic-type disorders, 21.8% bipolar disorders and other mood-linked problems, 13% behavioral disorders and 6.2% substance-use disorders. A percentage of 44.9 presented with a physical disease. Among the 89 hospitalizations, 86.5% were motivated by psychiatric disorders and 43% were forced. In about one third of the cases, hospitalizations were motivated by a double indication - psychiatric and physical - and in 13.5% for only a physical indication. Thirty people of the actively followed people had stayed in a halfway house as an alternative to hospitalization, restoring a continuity of care and allowing to resolve social problems that had until then been hopeless., PERSPECTIVES: The strategies developed by this Mobile Health Outreach Team ensure local community medical, psychiatric and social care for "hard to reach" people. The results confirm the interest of the link between the street work, the hospital and the halfway home, both as a living facility and an alternative to hospitalization. They suggest the importance of a critical minimum size for these EMPP that allows them a street work with doctors providing guidance. The presence of a GP is another welcome development because of the severity and the entanglement of somatic and psychiatric problems of these populations. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Despite the intuitive appeal and popularity of mentoring programs, mentoring has shown only limited success for positively impacting children's psychosocial functioning. Furthermore, we were not able to identify a study that examined the potential utility of mentoring for homeless adolescents., OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the impact of mentoring among a group of homeless adolescents who were also receiving substance abuse treatment., METHODS: This pilot study examined the impact of mentoring among homeless adolescents (n = 90) between the ages of 14 and 20 years who also received substance abuse treatment. A longitudinal design was used in which adolescents were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and following the completion of treatment at 6 months postbaseline., RESULTS: Findings showed that adolescents with a history of physical or sexual abuse attended more mentoring sessions. Also, mentoring in addition to treatment was associated with a decrease in problem consequences associated with substance use. However, more mentoring with fewer treatment sessions was associated with an increase in internalizing behaviors. Only these two outcomes were associated with mentoring., CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: While not providing resounding support for mentoring, this study suggests that examining the mentor/mentee relationship may be a fruitful line of future research given that significant variability among the mentor/mentee pairs was noted for some outcomes of interest.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The United States (U.S.) approved use of federal funds for needle and syringe programs (NSPs) in December 2009. This study compares syringe disposal practices in a U.S. city with NSPs to a U.S. city without NSPs by examining the prevalence of improperly discarded syringes in public places and the self-reported syringe disposal practices of injection drug users (IDUs) in the two cities., METHODS: We conducted visual inspection walkthroughs in a random sample of the top-quartile of drug-affected neighborhoods in San Francisco, California (a city with NSPs) and Miami, Florida (a city without NSPs). We also conducted quantitative interviews with adult IDUs in San Francisco (N=602) and Miami (N=448)., RESULTS: In the visual inspections, we found 44 syringes/1000 census blocks in San Francisco, and 371 syringes/1000 census blocks in Miami. Survey results showed that in San Francisco 13% of syringes IDUs reported using in the 30 days preceding the study interviews were disposed of improperly versus 95% of syringes by IDUs in Miami. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, IDUs in Miami had over 34 times the adjusted odds of public syringe disposal relative to IDUs in San Francisco (adjusted odds ratio=34.2, 95% CI=21.92, 53.47)., CONCLUSIONS: We found eight-fold more improperly disposed syringes on walkthroughs in the city without NSPs compared to the city with NSPs, which was corroborated by survey data. NSPs may help IDUs dispose of their syringes safely in cities with large numbers of IDUs. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - The effects of a harm reduction housing program on the viral loads of homeless individuals living with HIV/AIDS.

N2  - Although the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapies has increased survival rates for many individuals living with HIV/AIDS, chronically homeless individuals with the disease continue to experience poor clinical outcomes and high mortality rates in comparison to the general population living with HIV. Housing as a structural intervention for homeless people living with HIV/AIDS has been shown both to be feasible and to improve access to care. However, few studies report the impact of accessing stable housing on residents' viral load counts, even though viral load has been accepted as the best predictor of clinical prognosis for over a decade. The Open Door is a nonprofit agency that utilizes a harm reduction, housing first model of care to improve clinical outcomes for homeless people living with HIV. This article describes the first study that utilizes viral load to assess the effectiveness of a housing first approach. During the study period, we found that 69% of residents of The Open Door achieved undetectable viral loads, which far exceeds adherence rates ranging from 13 to 32% that were found in other studies of similar vulnerable populations. This finding supports the feasibility of this approach and its potential impact on reducing HIV morbidity, mortality, and secondary transmission. Given that the majority of the residents were active substance users during the study period and achieved undetectable viral loads, our findings also substantiate other studies demonstrating that substance users are able to maintain clinical adherence.

N2  - Street-based female sex workers constitute a vulnerable population for HIV, as they are often enmeshed in chronic patterns of substance use, sexual risk, homelessness, and violent victimization. This study examined the specific contributions of victimization history and abuse-related traumagenic factors to mental health functioning and sexual risk behaviors, while considering the impact of environmental risk factors as well. Using targeted sampling strategies, we enrolled 562 Miami-based female sex workers into an intervention trial testing the relative effectiveness of two alternative case management conditions in establishing linkages with health services and reducing risk for HIV. Lifetime prevalence of abuse was extremely elevated at 88%. Nearly half reported abuse before the age of 18, while 34% reported violent encounters with "dates" or clients in the past 90 days. Serious mental illness (SMI) was quite common, with 74% reporting severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, or traumatic stress. For those with histories of abuse, SMI appeared to mediate the association between abuse-related trauma and unprotected sex behaviors. Mental health treatment would appear to be an important component of effective HIV prevention among this vulnerable group, and should form part of a compendium of services offered to female sex workers.

N2  - We report on psychometric properties of a new questionnaire to study long-term strategies, practices and tactics that may help injection drug users (IDUs) avoid infection with HIV and hepatitis C. Sixty-two long-term IDUs were interviewed in New York City in 2009. Five scales based on a total of 47 items were formed covering the following domains: stigma avoidance, withdrawal prevention, homeless safety, embedding safety within a network of users, and access to resources/social support. All scales (alpha >= .79) except one (alpha = .61) were highly internally consistent. Seven single-item measures related to drug use reduction and injection practices were also analyzed. All variables were classified as either belonging to a group of symbiotic processes that are not directly focused upon disease prevention but nonetheless lead to risk reduction indirectly or as variables describing prevention tactics in risky situations. Symbiotic processes can be conceived of as unintentional facilitators of safe behaviors. Associations among variables offer suggestions for potential interventions. These Staying Safe variables can be used as predictors of risk behaviors and/or biological outcomes.

T1  - Demographic and substance abuse trends among pregnant and non-pregnant women: eleven years of treatment admission data.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - The objective of this study was to identify demographic and substance abuse trends among pregnant women entering treatment over eleven years. This study compiled the publicly available Treatment Episode Datasets from the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration from 1998 to 2008. Subjects included 1,724,479 women entering publicly funded substance abuse treatment for the first time, 81,818 of whom were pregnant. Compared to non-pregnant women, pregnant women were more likely to be younger, minority, never married, less educated, homeless, and on public-assistance or have no income. Referrals from health care providers (HCPs) among pregnant women entering treatment have stayed consistently low while referrals from the criminal justice system accounted for the largest portion of pregnant women entering treatment. Over the past eleven years, there has been a general decline in alcohol abuse and an increase in drug abuse among women entering treatment; this trend was more pronounced in pregnant women. Unlike their non-pregnant counterparts, pregnant women were more likely to report marijuana, not alcohol, as their primary problem substance as well as other drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine. Over the past eleven years, trends in the demographics and patterns of substance abuse among women have changed; some of these trends were unique to pregnant women. A large proportion of pregnant women entering treatment are referred by the criminal justice system. Knowledge surrounding the demographics and abuse patterns of pregnant women entering treatment can inform HCPs and community programs in their screening and outreach efforts.

N2  - Poverty and economic hardship remain a reality for many of America's children. Although the causes of poverty are varied, Americans strongly endorse individual responsibility as a primary cause. Because beliefs about poverty originate in childhood and adolescence, intervention efforts targeting young people may be particularly effective in shifting attitudes about the poor and policies designed to help the disadvantaged. To test this proposition, the current study evaluated the efficacy of a 1-week 8th grade social studies curriculum focusing on poverty and inequality. Study participants were upper middle-class youth enrolled in multiple sections of a Social Studies course taught by a single teacher. Participants had little direct contact with marginalized groups such as poor and homeless individuals in their communities. Students (N=66) completed a survey assessing their attitudes and beliefs about poverty and poor people prior to, and 1 week and 6 months post-instruction. Results indicated that the curriculum was partially effective in increasing the complexity of students' beliefs about poverty. Students were more likely to emphasize fatalistic causes and less likely to list individualistic causes for poverty following instruction than before, but rarely emphasized structural causes for poverty and rated individual effort as the most influential factor in determining one's success. Implications of the study findings for curriculum efforts targeting young adolescents' reasoning about economic inequality and inequity and directions for future studies are discussed.

N2  - Although lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth with a history of homelessness (running away or being evicted from their homes by parents) report more psychological symptoms than homeless heterosexual peers, it is unclear whether symptoms are due to homelessness, given the absence of a non-homeless comparison group. This study longitudinally investigates whether LGB youth with a history of homelessness report more subsequent psychological symptoms than non-homeless LGB youth and examines potential mediators of any such relationships. Of the 156 LGB youth interviewed (49% female; 78% non-White), 48% reported past homeless experiences. Homelessness was associated with subsequent symptoms of anxiety, depression, conduct problems, and substance abuse and to changes in symptoms over time even after controlling for childhood sexual abuse and early development of sexual orientation. Stressful life events, negative social relationships, and social support from friends mediated the relationships between homelessness and symptomatology. These findings suggest the need for interventions to reduce stress and enhance social support among LGB youth with a history of homelessness in order to reduce psychological symptoms.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - The paper presents findings from a longitudinal study identifying different classes of homeless individuals in a mid-size Canadian city based on health-related characteristics and comparing the housing trajectories of these classes 2 years later. Using data collected through in-person interviews with a sample of 329 single persons who have experienced homelessness, the paper presents results of a latent class analysis. Results found four distinct latent classes characterized by different levels of severity of health problems--i.e., a class of individuals who are "Higher Functioning" (28.7%), a second class with "Substance Abuse Problems" (27.1%), a third class with "Mental Health Substance Abuse Problems" (22.6%), and a fourth class with "Complex Physical and Mental Health Problems" (21.6%) that included having diminished physical functioning, multiple chronic physical health conditions, mental health difficulties, and in some cases substance abuse problems. Follow-up interviews with 197 of these individuals (59.9%) 2 years later showed the class of individuals with substance abuse problems experiencing the greatest difficulty in exiting homelessness and achieving housing stability. Implications of these findings for social policy development and program planning are discussed.

T1  - Social stability and HIV risk behavior: evaluating the role of accumulated vulnerability.
A1  - German, Danielle
A1  - Latkin, Carl A
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - This study evaluated a cumulative and syndromic relationship among commonly co-occurring vulnerabilites (homelessness, incarceration, low-income, residential transition) in association with HIV-related risk behaviors among 635 low-income women in Baltimore. Analysis included descriptive statistics, logistic regression, latent class analysis and latent class regression. Both methods of assessing multidimensional instability showed significant associations with risk indicators. Risk of multiple partners, sex exchange, and drug use decreased significantly with each additional domain. Higher stability class membership (77%) was associated with decreased likelihood of multiple partners, exchange partners, recent drug use, and recent STI. Multidimensional social vulnerabilities were cumulatively and synergistically linked to HIV risk behavior. Independent instability measures may miss important contextual determinants of risk. Social stability offers a useful framework to understand the synergy of social vulnerabilities that shape sexual risk behavior. Social policies and programs aiming to enhance housing and overall social stability are likely to be beneficial for HIV prevention.

Participants (N=72) enrolled in intervention modules to increase residential stability (room and self-care, money management, nutrition management or safe community participation), completed the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, ACLS-2000 and a Practical Skills Test at baseline, post-intervention and 3 and 6 months later to examine differences in trauma symptoms and treatment outcomes. Trauma symptoms were highest at baseline and decreased significantly for most participants over time. For a subgroup of females experiencing abuse and individuals who were homeless less than 1 year, there was an increase in symptoms at 3 months post-intervention (highest rate of housing transition). This small convenience sample represents a limited geographic area. Replication of the study with larger groups for generalization, and further investigation into the specific impact of symptoms on function were recommended for future research.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Factors responsible for the premature self-discharge of homeless tuberculosis (TB) patients from the hospital and the association between the self-discharge and treatment interruption were assessed., METHODS: A total of 205 homeless patients with TBs who were newly registered between January, 2007 and June, 2008 were evaluated. The subjects were divided into two groups (those who were discharged themselves from the hospital prematurely ["case" group] and those who were not [control group]), and the difference between the groups regarding the factors possibly responsible for the self-discharge was evaluated., RESULTS: i) Patient's characteristics: The subjects were all men; there were 45 in the "case" group and 160 in the control group. The proportion of subjects aged under 60 years was significantly higher in the "case" group (84.4%) than in the control group (52.5%). The proportion of subjects who consumed 360 mL or more of sake a day was significantly higher in the "case" group (64.4%) than in the control group (38.8%). ii) Questionnaire survey on admission: All of the patients were hospitalized for treatment of TB. In the interview on admission, more "case" group patients reported "I do not know much about TB" or "I am dissatisfied with my hospitalization", as shown by multiple logistic regression analysis. A review of troubles with inmates or healthcare workers over alcohol drinking or smoking showed that the proportion of subjects who had such troubles was significantly higher in the "case" group (55.6%) than in the control group (5.0%). iii) The association between the treatment outcomes and the self-discharge: The proportion of subjects with treatment outcomes of "cured" or "treatment completed" was significantly lower in the "case" group (46.7%) than in the control group (78.8%). The proportion of subjects with a treatment outcome of "defaulted" was significantly higher in the "case" group (42.2%) than in the control group (3.8%)., CONCLUSION: The patients who were aged under 60 years or who consumed 360 mL or more of sake a day were shown to be significantly more likely to discharge themselves prematurely, which warrants a more careful handling of such problems. The poor understanding of disease necessitates more adequate explanation of TB, or education, considering each patient's level of understanding. In addition, the patients' dissatisfaction with their hospital stay, as seen in the case group, should be more carefully addressed in order to avoid the higher rate of trouble.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Street children, common in Africa, are increasingly vulnerable to alcohol and drugs of abuse and lack access to both healthcare and knowledge about HIV and AIDS. Hence, this study assessed the level of knowledge about sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, among street adolescents in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)., METHODS: A random sampling of 200 street children (10-25 years of age) were selected from 17 rehabilitation centres in Kinshasa, and a structured questionnaire was administered to all participants in their respective centres. High knowledge, knowledge or awareness of condom was defined when a participant gave more than 67% of correct responses. Chi square analysis was used to test differences between sexes., RESULTS: The knowledge level of respondents was high. 54.3% of males and 45.7% of girls have heard about HIV), and few participants cited unprotected sex as mode of transmission (42.9% for males and 57.1% for females). A high number of children reported a previous sexual experience. Satisfying a natural bodily need was the main reason for having sex. However, the use of condoms is still low in both genders (26.2 versus 59.3%, p<0.01). Neither gender reported a reason why they are not using a condom., CONCLUSION: This study highlights the high knowledge about HIV, which contrasts with low condom use and high past sexual experiences with the high number of sexual partners and sexual contacts. Policies targeting these findings are warranted to reverse such trends.

N2  - This study identified homelessness, substance use, employment, and mental health correlates of homeless youths' arrest activity in 5 cities. Two hundred thirty-eight street youth from Los Angeles, Austin, Denver, New Orleans, and St. Louis were recruited using comparable sampling strategies. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression results reveal that being arrested for criminal activity is associated with length of homelessness, history of juvenile detention and incarceration, receiving income from theft, substance abuse, and mental illness. Arrests are also associated with interactions between lack of formal employment income and receiving income from theft and between drug and alcohol abuse/ dependency. Understanding the health and situational factors associated with homeless youths' delinquent activity has implications for providing more comprehensive health, mental health, and substance abuse services.

N2  - A world-wide recrudescence of tuberculosis has been seen, due to the deterioration of the health state of the population from many areas of the world, because of increasing number of homeless persons, and also the immigrants from countries with TB epidemic. The present epidemiological context draw attention to the necessity of early detection of the disease and the beginning of early directly observed treatment, preferably ambulatory, if the sick person doesn't have other complications, isn't infected with multidrog resistant bacili and lives in a properly social environment for his support. For the evaluation of tuberculosis epidemic in Olt county, the authors realised a retrospective study on a period of over 15 years (1990-2008), based on the analysis of the main epidemiological indices of TB epidemic in this county compared with Romania: global incidence both in adults and children, for new cases nd relapses apart, incidence of MDR-TB (multidrug resistant-tuberculosis) cases, mortality through tuberculosis. Global incidence of TB in Olt county almost doubled between 1990-2008, reaching 147, 4 per hundred thousand, with much higher values compared with the national ones. Olt county presents constant values over the national ones between 1995-2008, due to the global incidence and also to the new cases and relapses. The incidence of new cases in children in 2008 (20,4 per hundred thousand) was below the national level (28 per hundred thousand). The risk of illness for the 0-14 years old children from Olt county was significantly lower in 2008 compared with the previous year, which, toghether with a number of MDR-TB cases under 15, signifies a regress of the epidemic.

N2  - PROBLEM: Street-involved youth experience a range of mental health problems with elevated rates of psychiatric disorders compared with non-homeless youth. The overall objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of a relationship-based intervention for homeless youth receiving services from agencies in downtown Toronto., METHODS: The final sample included 15 homeless youth who met the study inclusion criteria. The intervention and comparison groups were compared at baseline and post-treatment on measures of mental health symptoms, hopelessness, self-esteem, resilience, and social connectedness., FINDINGS: Participants receiving the intervention demonstrated a significant improvement in social connectedness, with a trend toward decreased hopelessness. Those participants who did not receive the intervention did not demonstrate any improvements in social connectedness and hopelessness., CONCLUSION: This preliminary pilot study suggests that providing a relationship-based intervention to street-involved youth may offer promise to strengthen social relationships and to mitigate overwhelming hopelessness and despair.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A small percentage of high-risk patients accounts for a large proportion of Medicaid spending in the United States, which has become an urgent policy issue. Our objective was to pilot a novel patient-centered intervention for high-risk patients with frequent hospital admissions to determine its potential to improve care and reduce costs., METHODS: Community and hospital-based care management and coordination intervention with pre-post analysis of health care utilization. We enrolled Medicaid fee-for-service patients aged 18-64 who were admitted to an urban public hospital and identified as being at high risk for hospital readmission by a validated predictive algorithm. Enrolled patients were evaluated using qualitative and quantitative interview techniques to identify needs such as transportation to/advocacy during medical appointments, mental health/substance use treatment, and home visits. A community housing partner initiated housing applications in-hospital for homeless patients. Care managers facilitated appropriate discharge plans then worked closely with patients in the community using a harm reduction approach., RESULTS: Nineteen patients were enrolled; all were male, 18/19 were substance users, and 17/19 were homeless. Patients had a total of 64 inpatient admissions in the 12 months before the intervention, versus 40 in the following 12 months, a 37.5% reduction. Most patients (73.3%) had fewer inpatient admissions in the year after the intervention compared to the prior year. Overall ED visits also decreased after study enrollment, while outpatient clinic visits increased. Yearly study hospital Medicaid reimbursements fell an average of $16,383 per patient., CONCLUSIONS: A pilot intervention for high-cost patients shows promising results for health services usage. We are currently expanding our model to serve more patients at additional hospitals to see if the pilot's success can be replicated., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01292096.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We compared the readmission rates and the pattern of readmission among patients discharged against medical advice (AMA) to control patients discharged with approval over a one-year follow-up period., METHODS: A retrospective matched-cohort study of 656 patients(328 were discharged AMA) who were followed for one year after their initial hospitalization at an urban university-affiliated teaching hospital in Vancouver, Canada that serves a population with high prevalence of addiction and psychiatric disorders. Multivariate conditional logistic regression was used to examine the independent association of discharge AMA on 14-day related diagnosis hospital readmission. We fit a multivariate conditional negative binomial regression model to examine the readmission frequency ratio between the AMA and non-AMA group., PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: AMA patients were more likely to be homeless (32.3% vs. 11%) and have co-morbid conditions such as psychiatric illnesses, injection drug use, HIV, hepatitis C and previous gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients discharged AMA were more likely to be readmitted: 25.6% vs. 3.4%, p<0.001 by day 14. The AMA group were more likely to be readmitted within 14 days with a related diagnosis than the non-AMA group (Adjusted Odds Ratio 12.0; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 3.7-38.9). Patients who left AMA were more likely to be readmitted multiple times at one year compared to the non-AMA group (adjusted frequency ratio 1.6; 95% CI: 1.3-2.0). There was also higher all-cause in-hospital mortality during the 12-month follow-up in the AMA group compared to non-AMA group (6.7% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients discharged AMA were more likely to be homeless and have multiple co-morbid conditions. At one year follow-up, the AMA group had higher readmission rates, were predisposed to multiple readmissions and had a higher in-hospital mortality. Interventions to reduce discharges AMA in high-risk groups need to be developed and tested.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There is limited information on self-perceived oral health of homeless populations. This study quantified self-reported oral health among a metropolitan homeless adult population and compared against a representative sample of the metropolitan adult population obtained from the National Survey of Adult Oral Health., METHODS: A total of 248 homeless participants (age range 17-78 years, 79% male) completed a self-report questionnaire. Data for an age-matched, representative sample of metropolitan-dwelling adults were obtained from Australia's second National Survey of Adult Oral Health. Percentage responses and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, with non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals used to identify statistically significant differences between the two groups., RESULTS: Homeless adults reported poorer oral health than their age-matched general population counterparts. Twice as many homeless adults reported visiting a dentist more than a year ago and that their usual reason for dental attendance was for a dental problem. The proportion of homeless adults with a perceived need for fillings or extractions was also twice that of their age-matched general population counterparts. Three times as many homeless adults rated their oral health as 'fair' or 'poor'., CONCLUSIONS: A significantly greater proportion of homeless adults in an Australian metropolitan location reported poorer oral health compared with the general metropolitan adult population.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To examine methamphetamine use and its association with sexual behavior among young men who have sex with men., DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational analysis., SETTING: Eight US cities., PARTICIPANTS: As part of the Adolescent Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions, adolescent boys and young men who have sex with men, aged 12 to 24 years, were recruited from social venues (e.g., clubs, parks, and street corners) between January 3, 2005, and August 21, 2006, to complete a study survey., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reported methamphetamine use in the past 90 days and reported sexual risk behavior compared with individuals reporting no hard drug use and individuals reporting hard drug use in the past 90 days., RESULTS: Among 595 adolescent boys and young men, 64 reported recent methamphetamine use, and 444 reported no recent hard drug use (87 reported use of hard drugs other than methamphetamine). Recent methamphetamine use was associated with a history of sexually transmitted diseases (51.6%), 2 or more sex partners in the past 90 days (85.7%), sex with an injection drug user (51.6%), and sex with someone who has human immunodeficiency virus (32.8%) compared with individuals reporting no recent hard drug use (21.1%, 63.1%, 10.7%, and 11.1%, respectively; P < .05 for all [n = 441]). Recent users of methamphetamine were more likely to have a history of homelessness (71.9%) and were less likely to be currently attending school (35.9%) compared with individuals reporting no recent hard drug use (28.4% and 60.4%, respectively; P < .001 for both)., CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent boys and young men who have sex with men and use methamphetamine seem to be at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus. Prevention programs among this age group should address issues like housing, polydrug use, and educational needs.

N2  - Abstract HIV-infected patients frequently experience depression, drug use, and unstable housing but are often unable to access supportive services to manage these challenges. Data on barriers to needed supportive services are critical to improving patient access. Data from the Medical Monitoring Project (MMP), a national supplemental surveillance system for HIV-infected persons in care, was used to examine barriers to support service use and factors associated with need and unmet need for services. Interview data for 333 patients in care in 2007 and 2008 in Los Angeles County (LAC) showed that 71% (n=236) reported needing at least one supportive service and of these, 35% (n=83) reported at least one unmet need for services (46% Latino; 25% white; 83% male; 92% 30+; 77% gay/bisexual; 40% response rate). The main reasons that supportive services were not accessed included lack of information (47%; do not know where to go or who to call); an agency barrier (33%; system too confusing, wait list too long); or a financial/practical barrier (18%; too expensive, transportation problems). In a logistic regression that included all participants (n=333), African Americans (OR=3.1, 95% CI: 1.1-8.7) and those with incomes less than $10,000 were more likely to have service needs (odds ratio [OR]=3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-9.3). Among those with at least one service need (n=236), those who were gay or bisexual were more likely to report at least one unmet service need (OR=2.8; 95% CI: 1.3-6.1). Disparities were found for need and unmet need for supportive services by race/ethnicity; income and sexual orientation. The reported reasons that services were not obtained suggest needed improvements in information dissemination on availability and location of HIV support services and more streamlined delivery of services.

N2  - This study assessed the prevalence and correlates of behaviors used by homeless young people to survive on the streets. Survival behaviors include prostitution, selling blood or plasma, dealing drugs, stealing, and panhandling. One hundred ninety-six homeless young adults from 4 metropolitan areas-Los Angeles, CA (n = 50); Austin, TX (n = 50); Denver, CO (n = 50); and St. Louis, MO (n = 46)-participated in individual, semistructured, face-to-face interviews. Researchers predicted that youth transience would be related to high rates of survival behaviors. Multivariate logistic regression was used to test a model predicting relationships between survival behaviors and transience, employment, substance use, and social support. Young adults who were transient, unemployed, drug-addicted, and reliant on peers for help were more likely to use these survival behaviors. In addition, among the transient subsample, being White, more reliant on peers for help, more transient, and having been victimized were associated with high use of these survival behaviors. Identification of the environmental and demographic factors associated with survival behaviors suggests that there may be value in combining harm-reduction strategies with efforts to reduce the transience of homeless young adults.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The U.S. federal government recently committed itself to ending chronic homelessness within 5 years. Women constitute one out of four chronically homeless adults and represent a particularly vulnerable group, but have been little studied. To identify potentially unique needs in this group, we report characteristics and 2-year outcomes in a large sample of male and female chronically homeless adults participating in a multisite, supportive housing program., METHODS: Men and women participating in the outcome evaluation of the 11-site Collaborative Initiative on Chronic Homelessness (n = 714) supportive housing program and who received at least one follow-up assessment were compared on baseline characteristics and up to 2-year follow-up outcomes. Mixed model multivariate regression adjusted outcome findings for baseline group differences., RESULTS: Few significant baseline differences existed between males and females, with both sexes self-reporting very high rates of lifetime mental health (83% women, 74% men) and substance use (68% women, 73% men) problems. Throughout the 2-year follow-up, both men and women dramatically increased the number of days housed, showed minimal changes in substance use patterns, and had modest improvements in mental health outcomes, without significant differences between genders., CONCLUSION: Unlike other U.S. populations, chronically homeless adults do not demonstrate substantial gender differences on mental health or addiction problems. Policy and service delivery must address these remarkably high rates of substance use and mental illness. Copyright Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The increased mortality of homeless people compared with non-homeless people might be linked to psychiatric disorders. However, homeless people are, because of their insufficient accommodation, difficult to sample and monitor, which has limited previous studies. We aimed to assess registered psychiatric disorders, mortality, and predictors of mortality in the homeless shelter population in Denmark., METHODS: We did a nationwide, prospective, register-based cohort study of homeless people aged 16 years and older who were registered in the Danish Homeless Register between Jan 1, 1999, and Dec 31, 2009. We calculated the proportion of registered psychiatric disorders, overall and cause-specific standardised mortality ratio (SMR), and life expectancy. Hazard ratios (HRs) were used to assess predictors of death., FINDINGS: 32,711 homeless people (23,040 men and 9671 women) were included in the study population. 14,381 men (62.4%) and 5632 women (58.2%) had registered psychiatric disorders, and 11,286 men (49.0%) and 3564 women (36.9%) had a substance abuse diagnosis. During the study period, 3839 men (16.7%) and 951 women (9.8%) died. The overall SMR for men was 5.6 (95% CI 5.4-5.8) and for women was 6.7 (6.2-7.1), and external causes accounted for 1161 (27.9%) of 4161 deaths for which information on the cause was available. Remaining life expectancy at age 15-24 years was 21.6 years (95% CI 21.2-22.1) and 17.4 years (16.4-18.5) lower for homeless men and women, respectively, than the general population. Registered substance abuse disorder was associated with the highest mortality risk compared with no psychiatric contact registered (adjusted HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.5 for men; 1.7, 1.4-2.1 for women)., INTERPRETATION: Health problems are extensive in the homeless shelter population and there is an urgent need for more sustained efforts to reduce the high morbidity and mortality, especially from external causes. Register data is an important resource to supplement existing knowledge on homeless people with more valid and detailed information., FUNDING: The Danish Council for Independent Research.

N2  - CONTEXT: Palliative care is an essential element of HIV care throughout the disease trajectory, but there is a lack of information to guide clinical care at HIV diagnosis., OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aimed to identify and appraise the evidence of palliative care-related problems at HIV diagnosis., METHODS: The search strategy combined the term "HIV" with seven key words derived from the World Health Organization definition of multidimensional palliative care, in a systematic search of four databases. Abstracts and papers were screened to identify those recording problems within six months of HIV diagnosis in adults. Sample descriptions, aims, methods, and prevalence findings were extracted from these papers into common tables., RESULTS: Of 5443 titles retrieved, 65 met the inclusion criteria and 34 were retained. Papers included 27 original studies and seven secondary analyses of patient's records, with great heterogeneity in design, sample definition, and outcome measures. Physical and psychological symptoms were highly prevalent (pain 11%-76%, weight loss 8%-89%, fever 32%-89%, diarrhea 6%-54%, anxiety 36%-95%, and depression 18%-47%). At HIV diagnosis, well-being was impaired, suicidal thoughts were frequent, and peace and calmness were reduced. Participants lacked emotional support and feared the reaction of their families. Practical problems included hunger, homelessness, reduced ability to work, and need for childcare. Studies had methodological failings such as the use of unvalidated tools and lack of clarity reporting results., CONCLUSION: People who have recently been diagnosed with HIV have multidimensional palliative care-related problems. HIV care and support services need to assess and manage problems using integrated palliative care, with referral for complex problems. Patient centeredness must be a principle of HIV clinical research. Copyright A© 2011 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Proper shoe size is an important element of foot health, especially in the elderly and diabetic populations. An improper fit can lead to pain, functional limitations, and falls. The aim of the present study was to determine the proportion of adults who are unaware of their own shoe size in 3 different New York City populations: a foot specialist private practice, an academic diabetic foot and ankle clinic, and a charity care center, the Bowery clinic, serving the homeless. A shoe size mismatch was defined as a difference of at least 0.5 in size between the measured foot and the shoe size. Demographic data were collected during the examination and retrospectively by chart review. A total of 235 volunteers participated in our study. A significant difference in the prevalence of the measured foot and shoe size mismatch was found between the cohort from the private practice compared with both the diabetic foot and ankle clinic and the Bowery clinic (P < .01 and P < .01, respectively). A significant difference was also detected (P < .05) between the private practice and the Bowery mission cohort when a difference of at least 1.5 sizes was present between the measured foot and the shoe size. Of those with a foot to shoe size mismatch, 60% had a difference of more than 0.5 in the shoe size between their right and left foot. In conclusion, our findings suggest that proper footwear sizing is lacking among a large proportion of our patients and that an adequate shoe size can be achieved with proper counseling.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Emilia Romagna, a northern Italian region, has a population of 4.27 million, of which 9.7% are immigrants. The objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) during the period 1996-2006 in not Italy-born compared to Italy-born cases., METHODS: Data was obtained from the Regional TB surveillance system, from where personal data, clinical features and risk factors of all notified TB cases were extracted., RESULTS: 5377 TB cases were reported. The proportion of immigrants with TB, over the total number of TB cases had progressively increased over the years, from 19.1% to 53.3%. In the not Italy-born population, TB incidence was higher than in Italians (in 2006: 100.7 cases per 100,000 registered not Italy-born subjects and 83.9/100,000 adding 20% of estimated irregular presences to the denominators. TB incidence among Italians was 6.5/100,000 Italians). A progressive rise in the not Italy-born incident cases was observed but associated with a decline in TB incidence. Not Italy-born cases were younger compared to the Italy-born cases, and more frequently classified as "new cases" (OR 2.0 95%CI 1.61-2.49 for age group 20-39); 60.7% had pulmonary TB, 31.6% extra pulmonary and 7.6% disseminated TB. Risk factors for TB in this population group were connected to lower income status (homeless: OR 149.9 95%CI 20.7-1083.3 for age group 40-59)., CONCLUSIONS: In low-incidence regions, prevention and control of TB among sub-groups at risk such as the foreign-born population is a matter of public health concern. In addition, increasing immigration rates may affect TB epidemiology. TB among immigrants is characterized by particular clinical features and risk factors, which should be analyzed in order to plan effective action.

N2  - RATIONALE: To improve the effectiveness of tuberculosis (TB) control programs in the United States by identifying cost-effective priorities for screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI)., OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of LTBI screening using the tuberculin skin test (TST)and interferon-g release assays (IGRAs)., METHODS: A Markov model of screening for LTBI with TST and IGRA in risk-groups considered in current LTBI screening guidelines., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In all risk-groups, TST and IGRA screening resulted in increased mean life expectancy, ranging from 0.03-0.24 life-months per person screened. IGRA screening resulted in greater life expectancy gains than TST. Screening always cost more than not screening, but IGRA was cost-saving compared with TST in some groups. Four patterns of cost-effectiveness emerged, related to four risk categories. (1) Individuals at highest risk of TB reactivation (close contacts and those infected with HIV): the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of IGRA compared with TST was less than $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. (2) The foreign-born: IGRA was cost-saving compared with TST and cost-effective compared with no screening (ICER ,$100,000 per QALY gained). (3) Vulnerable populations (e.g., homeless, drug user, or former prisoner): the ICER of TST screening was approximately $100,000-$150,000 per QALY gained, but IGRA was not cost-effective. (4) Medical comorbidities (e.g., diabetes): the ICER of screening with TST or IGRA was greater than $100,000 per QALY., CONCLUSIONS: LTBI screening guidelines could make progress toward TB elimination by prioritizing screening for close contacts, those infected with HIV, and the foreign-born regardless of time living in the United States. For these groups, IGRA screening was more cost-effective than TST screening.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess improvement in documentation of asthma indicators using the Asthma Toolbox, an asthma decision-making tool developed in accord with National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines., DESIGN: Retrospective medical record review using cross-sectional, independent, random samples. Reviews were conducted for 1-year periods before and after implementation and after revision reflecting 2007 guideline modifications., SETTING: Two inner-city, federally qualified health center programs providing pediatric primary care to housed and homeless populations., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1246 patients aged 6 months to 18 years with at least 1 asthma visit to a community health center using paper records (n = 600) or a mobile medical program serving family homeless shelters using an electronic health record (EHR; n = 646)., INTERVENTION: Implementation of the Asthma Toolbox incorporated into paper encounter forms and embedded in the EHR to guide providers (ie, physicians and nurse practitioners) through pediatric asthma assessment and management., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Documentation of a subset of asthma severity/control measures, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and percentage of persistent asthmatic patients prescribed controller medications., RESULTS: Documentation of each asthma indicator increased significantly after implementation (chi(2) tests; P < .001 all comparisons) for both programs. Documentation of severity/control increased from 25.5% to 77.5% in paper records and from 11.7% to 85.1% in the EHR (P < .001). Increases were sustained after Asthma Toolbox revision for all indicators. The percentage of patients with persistent/uncontrolled asthma prescribed controller medications reached 96% to 97% in both programs., CONCLUSION: Use of the Asthma Toolbox, an asthma decision-making tool, significantly increased documentation of pediatric asthma management among providers working in high-disparity, urban primary care settings.

N2  - AIMS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the methodological quality and effectiveness of behavioural smoking cessation interventions targeted at six disadvantaged groups; the homeless, prisoners, indigenous populations, at-risk youth, individuals with low socio-economic status and individuals with a mental illness., METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and PsycInfo databases were searched using MeSH and keywords for studies conducted in developed countries prior to October 2010. Included studies were assessed for methodological quality. A DerSimonian and Laird random effects meta-analysis was conducted where possible to explore the effectiveness of interventions for the different subgroups. A narrative review was conducted for studies unable to be included in the meta-analysis. Outcomes examined were abstinence rates at short-term (up to 3 months) and long-term (6 months or the longest) follow-up., RESULTS: Thirty-two relevant studies were identified. The majority (n = 20) were rated low in methodological quality. Results of the meta-analysis showed a significant increase in cessation for behavioural support interventions targeted at low-income female smokers at short-term follow-up [relative risk (RR) 1.68, confidence interval (CI) 1.21-2.33], and behavioural support interventions targeted at individuals with a mental illness at long-term follow-up (RR 1.35, CI 1.01-1.81). Results of the narrative review showed several promising interventions that increased cessation rates at 6-month or longer follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Few well-controlled trials have examined the most effective smoking cessation strategies for highly disadvantaged groups, especially among the homeless, indigenous smokers and prisoners. The use of behavioural smoking cessation interventions for some socially disadvantaged groups appears promising; however, overall findings are inconsistent. Further research is needed to establish the most effective interventions for vulnerable high-risk groups. Special attention should be given to increasing sample size and power, and to sound evaluation methodology to overcome methodological limitations of conducting research with these high-risk groups.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The authors examined treatment utilization and outcomes over 2 years among patients admitted to emergency departments with early-phase primary or substance-induced psychosis. The main hypothesis was that patients with substance-induced psychosis would have a more benign course of illness than those with primary psychosis, METHOD: Using a prospective naturalistic cohort study design, the authors compared 217 patients with early-phase primary psychosis plus substance use and 134 patients with early-phase substance-induced psychosis who presented to psychiatric emergency departments at hospitals in Upper Manhattan. Assessments at baseline and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months included psychiatric diagnoses, service use, and institutional outcomes using the Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders; psychiatric symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; social, vocational, and family functioning using the World Health Organization Psychiatric Disability Assessment Schedule; and life satisfaction using the Quality of Life Interview. Longitudinal analyses were conducted using generalized estimating equations., RESULTS: Participants with primary psychosis were more likely to receive antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing medications, undergo hospitalizations, and have outpatient psychiatric visits; those with substance-induced psychosis were more likely to receive addiction treatments. Only a minority of each group received minimally adequate treatments. Both groups improved significantly over time on substance dependence, psychotic symptoms, homelessness, and psychosocial outcomes, and few group-by-time interactions emerged., CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting to Upper Manhattan emergency departments with either early-phase primary psychosis or substance-induced psychosis improved steadily over 2 years despite minimal use of mental health and substance abuse services.

N2  - Men who have sex with men (MSM), men who have sex with men and women (MSM/W) and transgender women (TGW) remain the populations most severely and disproportionately impacted upon by HIV in Los Angeles County. Baseline data from community-based HIV-prevention programmes serving these populations were analysed to explore differences in demographic characteristics, substance use and sexual partnering between the three groups. Despite high HIV prevalence overall (MSM 34.7% versus MSM/W 16.1% versus TGW 21.9%, p < .001), there were striking differences in risk behaviours. Higher rates of homelessness were reported by MSM/W compared to MSM and TGW. Lower rates of education and less substance use were reported by TGW (62.2%), compared to MSM (79.7%) and MSM/W (92.6%). A much higher number of male sexual exchange partners were reported by TGW (MSM 1.04 [SD = 4.8] versus MSM/W 1.54 [SD = 10.3] versus TGW 12.37 [SD = 23.9], p < .001). Findings support the need for HIV-prevention interventions that specifically address the unique risk patterns among each population in order to curb HIV acquisition and transmission.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Art has been shown to be an empowering and engaging entity with numerous benefits to vulnerable populations, including the homeless persons and young adults. However, little is known how homeless young adults perceive the use of art as messages that can communicate the danger of initiating or continuing drug and alcohol use., OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to solicit perspectives of homeless, drug-using young adults as to how art can be used to design messages for their peers about the danger of initiating or continuing drug and alcohol use., METHODS: Qualitative methodology via focus group discussions was utilized to engage 24 homeless young adults enrolled from a drop-in site in Santa Monica, California., RESULTS: The findings revealed support for a myriad of delivery styles, including in-person communication, flyers, music, documentary film, and creative writing. The young adults also provided insight into the importance of the thematic framework of messages. Such themes ranged from empowering and hopeful messages to those designed to scare young homeless adults into not experimenting with drugs., CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that in addition to messages communicating the need to prevent or reduce drug and alcohol use, homeless young adults respond to messages that remind them of goals and dreams they once had for their future, and to content that is personal, real, and truthful. Our research indicates that messages that reinforce protective factors such as hope for the future and self-esteem may be as important to homeless young adults as information about the risks and consequences of drug use.

N2  - Among 559 street youth recruited between 2005 and 2007 in Vancouver, Canada, young drug users (<21 years of age) were compared with older drug users (>=21 years) with regard to recent drug use and sexual practices using multiple logistic regression. Older youth were more likely to be male and of Aboriginal ancestry, to have more significant depressive symptoms, to have recently engaged in crack smoking, and to have had a recent history of injection drug use. Young drug users, by contrast, were more likely to have engaged in recent binge alcohol use. Efforts to reduce drug use-related harm among street youth may be improved by considering the highly prevalent use of "harder" drugs and risk for depression among older youth.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine whether illicit drug users recruited through respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and targeted street outreach (TSO) differ by comparing two samples recruited concurrently with respect to sample selection and potential recruitment biases., METHODS: Two hundred seventeen (217) heroin, crack, and cocaine users aged 18-40 years were recruited through TSO in New York City (2006-2009). Forty-six RDS seeds were recruited similarly and concurrently, yielding a maximum of 14 recruitment waves and 357 peer recruits. Baseline questionnaires ascertained sociodemographic, drug use, and drug network characteristics. Descriptive statistics and log-binomial regression were used to compare RDS and TSO samples., RESULTS: RDS recruits were more likely to be male (prevalence ratio [PR]:1.28), Hispanic (PR:1.45), black (PR: 1.58), older (PR: 1.02), homeless (PR: 1.19), and crack users (PR: 1.37). RDS recruited fewer injectors (PR:0.35) and heroin users (PR:0.74). Among injectors, RDS recruits injected less frequently (PR:0.77) and were less likely to use Needle Exchange Programs (PR:0.35)., CONCLUSION: These data suggest that RDS and TSO strategies reach different subgroups of drug users. Understanding the differing capabilities of each recruitment strategy will enable researchers and public health practitioners to select an appropriate recruitment tool for future research and public health practice.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Collecting population data on sensitive issues such as non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is problematic. Case note audits or hospital/clinic based presentations only record severe cases and do not distinguish between suicidal and non-suicidal intent. Community surveys have largely been limited to school and university students, resulting in little much needed population-based data on NSSI. Collecting these data via a large scale population survey presents challenges to survey methodologists. This paper addresses the methodological issues associated with collecting this type of data via CATI., METHODS: An Australia-wide population survey was funded by the Australian Government to determine prevalence estimates of NSSI and associations, predictors, relationships to suicide attempts and suicide ideation, and outcomes. Computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) on a random sample of the Australian population aged 10+ years of age from randomly selected households, was undertaken., RESULTS: Overall, from 31,216 eligible households, 12,006 interviews were undertaken (response rate 38.5%). The 4-week prevalence of NSSI was 1.1% (95% ci 0.9-1.3%) and lifetime prevalence was 8.1% (95% ci 7.6-8.6). Methodological concerns and challenges in regard to collection of these data included extensive interviewer training and post interview counselling. Ethical considerations, especially with children as young as 10 years of age being asked sensitive questions, were addressed prior to data collection. The solution required a large amount of information to be sent to each selected household prior to the telephone interview which contributed to a lower than expected response rate. Non-coverage error caused by the population of interest being highly mobile, homeless or institutionalised was also a suspected issue in this low prevalence condition. In many circumstances the numbers missing from the sampling frame are small enough to not cause worry, especially when compared with the population as a whole, but within the population of interest to us, we believe that the most likely direction of bias is towards an underestimation of our prevalence estimates., CONCLUSION: Collecting valid and reliable data is a paramount concern of health researchers and survey research methodologists. The challenge is to design cost-effective studies especially those associated with low-prevalence issues, and to balance time and convenience against validity, reliability, sampling, coverage, non-response and measurement error issues.

N2  - Genotoxicity of glue sniffing/huffing and tobacco use has been examined in 302 street boys (median age 13 years) and 50 age-matched control school boys who were neither tobacco nor glue users. All the street boys were tobacco users. In addition, 155 were addicted to gasp an industrial adhesive popularly known as 'Golden glue'. Micronucleus (MN) frequency was determined as a measure of chromosomal breakage in exfoliated buccal epithelial cells (BECs) and DNA double strand breaks were quantitatively assessed by counting gamma-H2AX foci using immunofluorescence microscopy. Micronucleated cell frequencies (MCFs) in BEC of glue non-addicted (only tobacco) and addicted (tobacco plus glue) street boys were 1.87 +/- 1.06 and 4.04 +/- 2.55 respectively, which were significantly higher than that of control (0.32 +/- 0.11, p<0.0001). Similarly, the numbers gamma-H2AX foci in nuclei of BEC were 2.3- and 5.2-times more than control in glue non-addicted and addicted street boys respectively (p<0.0001). Spearman's rank correlation revealed a strong positive association between years of glue addiction with MCFs and gamma-H2AX foci numbers, and the association between glue addiction and chromosomal and DNA damage remained positive and significant after controlling income, spending on addiction and loss of appetite as potential confounders in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Thus, addiction to tobacco among the street children in India is associated with chromosomal and DNA damage in BECs and the severity of these changes is significantly increased by the habit of sniffing/huffing of industrial glue.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Homeless youth are at high risk for HIV infection as a consequence of risky sexual behaviour. Interventions for homeless youth are challenging. Assessment of the effectiveness of interventions to modify sexual risk behaviours for preventing HIV in homeless youth is needed., OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and summarize the effectiveness of interventions for modifying sexual risk behaviours and preventing transmission of HIV among homeless youth., SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AIDSearch, Gateway, PsycInfo, LILACS), reference lists of eligible articles, international health agency publication lists, and clinical trial registries. The search was updated January 2010. We contacted authors of published reports and other key role players., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised studies of interventions to modify sexual risk behaviour (biological, self-reporting of sexual-risk behaviour or health-seeking behaviour) in homeless youth (12-24 years)., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data from eligible studies were extracted by two reviewers. We assessed risk of bias per the Cochrane Collaborations tool. None of the eligible studies reported any primary biological outcomes for this review. Reports of self-reporting sexual risk behaviour outcomes varied across studies precluding calculation of summary measures of effect; we present the outcomes descriptively for each study. We contacted authors for missing or ambiguous data., MAIN RESULTS: We identified three eligible studies after screening a total of 255 unique records. All three were performed in the United States of America and recruited substance-abusing male and female adolescents (total N=615) through homeless shelters into randomised controlled trials of independent and non-overlapping behavioural interventions. The three trials differed in theoretical background, delivery method, dosage (number of sessions,) content and outcome assessments. Overall, the variability in delivery and outcomes precluded estimation of summary of effect measures. We assessed the risk of bias to be high for each of the studies. Whilst some effect of the interventions on outcome measures were reported, heterogeneity and lack of robustness in these studies necessitate caution in interpreting the effectiveness of these interventions., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The body of evidence does not permit conclusions on the impact of interventions to modify sexual risk behaviour in homeless youth; more research is required. While the psychosocial and contextual factors that fuel sexual risk behaviours among homeless youth challenge stringent methodologies of RCT's, novel ways for program delivery and trial retention are in need of development. Future trials should comply with rigorous methodology in design, delivery, outcome measurement and reporting.

N2  - AIM: To study the mortality and causes of death among homeless men and women in relation to the risk indicators, previous treatment for alcohol and drug abuse, previous treatment for mental disorders and non-Swedish citizenship., METHODS: The mortality was studied in a cohort comprising 1,757 men and 526 women compared with the general population and persons with inpatient treatment for alcohol- and drug-related disorders. The follow-up period was from 1995 to 1997 until the end of 2005. The causes of death were analyzed., RESULTS: 421 deaths occurred during the follow-up period. The relative risk of death was 3.1, with no difference in mortality between homeless men and homeless women. Previous treatment for alcohol and drug abuse disorders was related to excess mortality and previous treatment for mental disease to lower mortality. Homeless people with inpatient treatment for alcohol or drug use disorders had no higher mortality than the general population in Stockholm with a similar history. There was a dominance of alcohol- and drug-related causes of death., DISCUSSION: Compared with previous studies of homeless people in Stockholm the excess mortality among men found in this study is of the same magnitude. Mortality among women is lower. The mortality rate in homeless people with previous treatment for an alcohol and illicit drug use disorder did not differ from those treated for these disorders in the general population., CONCLUSIONS: The most important finding is that excess mortality among homeless men and women in Stockholm is entirely related to alcohol and drug abuse.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Several studies have shown the adverse health consequences of food insecurity on household members. To what extent this relationship is mediated by gender among adolescents has not been documented. We hypothesized that the health consequences of food insecurity would be more pronounced in girls compared with boys., METHODS: We used the first-round data from a 5-year longitudinal family survey of 2084 adolescents aged 13 to 17 years from urban, semiurban, and rural areas of southwest Ethiopia. Stratified random sampling was used to select households and adolescents. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare self-reported morbidity according to food-security status and gender after adjusting for nutritional and socioeconomic covariates., RESULTS: Overall, 29.9% of girls and 19.2% of boys reported illness during the previous 1 month before the survey. Food-insecure girls were twice as likely to report suffering from an illness (P < .01) compared with boys, and the risk of reported illness tripled when girls were food insecure and were part of food-insecure households (P < .01). Girls were 7.4 and 7.0 times more likely to report difficulties with activities because of poor health and having a feeling of tiredness/low energy compared with boys, respectively (P < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: We report that in a food-insecure situation, gender is an important predictor of an adolescent's self-reported health status. Food-security interventions should consider gender as a key variable to narrow the gap in health between boys and girls.

N2  - We investigated the use of dental care services among a population of low-income persons living with HIV/AIDS who had not seen a dental care provider during the 12 months prior to study enrollment. A total of 593 participants were recruited from five HIV primary care clinics in two South Florida counties and interviewed regarding past utilization of dental care services, HIV primary care service utilization, and barriers to care. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine correlates of oral care utilization within the preceding two years. One-third of respondents reported seeing a dentist in the preceding two years. The odds of having seen a dentist were greater for respondents with stable housing, more than a high school education, and who had received help in getting dental care; black respondents (compared to Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites) were less likely to have seen a dentist in the preceding two years. Despite the availability of dental services for low-income HIV-positive persons, utilization of dental care remains low. This study reinforces the need to provide assistance to HIV-positive persons in obtaining dental care. In particular, it indicates that such assistance should be targeted toward Black Americans, persons with low income and unstable housing situations, and those with limited help to navigate the health care system.

N2  - PURPOSE: this study examined whether differences exist among women with mental health issues who had either young, adult, or no children in relation to their individual and social vulnerabilities, health, and quality of life., METHODS: the design of this study was a secondary quantitative analysis of data extracted from a larger Canadian 5-year study focused on mental health and housing. This study's sample included 234 female psychiatric consumer/survivors: 108 (46%) women reported having no children, 68 (29%) had at least one child younger than 18 years of age, and 58 (25%) had children 18 years of age or older. The women completed structured interviews between 2004 and 2006., FINDINGS: seventy-nine percent of mothers were separated from their young children. In comparison with women with older children and those without children, women with young children were more often homeless, had fewer strengths/resources, greater physical but lower cognitive/intellectual functioning, and a low perception of quality of life regarding their financial situation. In addition, women with young children reported the greatest problem with substance use and poorest quality of life regarding daily activities, health, and overall quality of life. These results, however, were mediated by the confounding effects of housing. No differences were identified between groups regarding utilization of health and social services., CONCLUSION: these findings support the need for early integrated health and social interventions that assist women achieve their well-being.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Access to sufficient food--in terms of both quality and quantity--is especially critical for children. Undernourishment during childhood and adolescence can have health implications, both short and long term. The prevalence of food insecurity was assessed in a sample of Vermont school children, as well as the relationship between food insecurity, participation in school breakfast or lunch, exercise and body mass index (BMI), all with a goal to identify needs to improve effectiveness of current programs., METHODS: A cross-sectional, 23-item self-administered survey of students attending a public middle school in Vermont., RESULTS: Twenty percent of the children were residing in a food insecure household. No statistically significant differences were observed in terms of age, sex or BMI percentile and food security status. Food insecure (with or without hunger) participants were less likely to eat breakfast at home compared to food secure participants (67.1% vs 81.4%, p = .007). However, such differences were not observed between eating school breakfast or lunch. Sixty-two percent of food insecure (with or without hunger) participants engaged in daily exercise compared to 75.9% food secure participants (p = .014)., CONCLUSION: Children in food insecure households were less likely to be physically active and to eat breakfast at home. However, the school breakfast program is negating any difference between the 2 groups in terms of eating breakfast at all. We consider this a success given the short- and long-term implications of food insecurity in children. We believe these findings have important implications for schools, policy makers, and programs to reduce food insecurity. Copyright © 2011, American School Health Association.

N2  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening can provide opportunities to reduce disease progression through counseling against alcohol use, but empirical data on this issue are sparse. We determined the efficacy of a behavioral intervention in reducing alcohol use among young, HCV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) (n=355) and assessed whether changes in liver enzymes were associated with changes in alcohol consumption., METHODS: Both the intervention and attention-control groups were counseled to avoid alcohol use, but the intervention group received enhanced counseling. Logistic regression, ANOVA, and continuous time Markov models were used to identify factors associated with alcohol use, changes in mean ALT and AST levels, and change in alcohol use post-intervention., RESULTS: Six months post-intervention, alcohol abstinence increased 22.7% in both groups, with no difference by intervention arm. Transition from alcohol use to abstinence was associated with a decrease in liver enzymes, with a marginally greater decrease in the intervention group (p=0.05 for ALT; p=0.06 for AST). In multivariate Markov models, those who used marijuana transitioned from alcohol abstinence to consumption more rapidly than non-users (RR=3.11); those who were homeless transitioned more slowly to alcohol abstinence (RR=0.47); and those who had ever received a clinical diagnosis of liver disease transitioned more rapidly to abstinence (RR=1.88)., CONCLUSIONS: Although, behavioral counseling to reduce alcohol consumption among HCV-infected IDUs had a modest effect, reductions in alcohol consumption were associated with marked improvements in liver function. Interventions to reduce alcohol use among HCV-infected IDUs may benefit from being integrated into clinical care and monitoring of HCV infection.

N2  - OBJECTIVE(S): To estimate the incidence rate of initiation into drug injection and to identify predictors of initiation into drug injection separately among street girls and boys., DESIGN: Data from two consecutive prospective street youth cohort studies (1995-2001 and 2001-2005) were used to conduct these analyses, stratified by gender., METHODS: Data were collected using semi-annual interviewer-administered questionnaires. Variables from the following domains were considered in Cox regression models: socio-demographic characteristics, early and current substance abuse, marginalization, childhood traumatic sexual events and injection exposure., RESULTS: Of the 946 youth who had never injected drugs at study entry, 86.4% completed at least two questionnaires representing 243 girls and 574 boys. Incidence rates of injection of 7.0 and 5.9 per 100 person-years were observed among these girls and boys respectively. Among girls, cocaine or crack use (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR)=1.97), heroin use (AHR=2.86), homelessness (AHR=2.49) and hanging out regularly with people who inject (AHR=4.46) all independently increased risk of first injection. Among boys, age decreased risk of initiating injection (AHR=0.90/year), while cocaine or crack use (AHR=2.14), heroin use (AHR=3.56), homelessness before age 16 (AHR=1.68), incest or rape before age 14 (AHR=1.98) and hanging out regularly with people who inject (AHR=1.66) all independently increased this risk., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest similar rates of initiation among girls and boys; however, factors associated with initiation vary by gender. This might lead to the design of more effective programs to prevent initiation into drug injection. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - Online social networking technologies, HIV knowledge, and sexual risk and testing behaviors among homeless youth.
A1  - Young, Sean D

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - This study evaluates associations between online social networking and sexual health behaviors among homeless youth in Los Angeles. We analyzed survey data from 201 homeless youth accessing services at a Los Angeles agency. Multivariate (regression and logistic) models assessed whether use of (and topics discussed on) online social networking technologies affect HIV knowledge, sexual risk behaviors, and testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). One set of results suggests that using online social networks for partner seeking (compared to not using the networks for seeking partners) is associated with increased sexual risk behaviors. Supporting data suggest that (1) using online social networks to talk about safe sex is associated with an increased likelihood of having met a recent sex partner online, and (2) having online sex partners and talking to friends on online social networks about drugs and partying is associated with increased exchange sex. However, results also suggest that online social network usage is associated with increased knowledge and HIV/STI prevention among homeless youth: (1) using online social networks to talk about love and safe sex is associated with increased knowledge about HIV, (2) using the networks to talk about love is associated with decreased exchange sex, and (3) merely being a member of an online social network is associated with increased likelihood of having previously tested for STIs. Taken together, this study suggests that online social networking and the topics discussed on these networks can potentially increase and decrease sexual risk behaviors depending on how the networks are used. Developing sexual health services and interventions on online social networks could reduce sexual risk behaviors.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to determine the prevalence of chronic illness and chronic pain in emergency department (ED) patients across demographic backgrounds., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study at an urban, level I trauma center with 98,000 annual visits. This was a prospective sample of adult patients presenting to the ED during a randomized distribution of daily 8-hour periods between June 4 and August 26, 2007. Prevalence of chronic illness was compared to subject demographics using logistic regression, and prevalence of chronic pain was compared using ordinal logistic regression., RESULTS: Six thousand nine hundred sixty-one patients presented during the data collection periods; 3882 were eligible, and 3132 (82%) were enrolled (51.7% male; age, 41.1 +/- 15.8 years; range, 18-98 years). Chronic illness was reported in 36.3% of patients and chronic pain in 34.9% of patients. Chronic illness was associated with homelessness (odds ratio [OR], 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-2.61), family income less than $25,000 (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.60-3.22), and lack of access to primary care facilities (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 2.25-3.21). Chronic pain was associated with homelessness (OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.79-3.64), family income less than $25,000 (OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.91-3.39), and lack of access to primary care facilities (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.26-1.70)., CONCLUSIONS: Patient housing situation, family income, and perceived access to primary care medical facilities were associated with higher self-reported rates of chronic illness and chronic pain.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Young drug misusers and the homeless both have a greater risk of death than their peers. This study sought to estimate the additional impact of homelessness on the risk of death for young drugs misusers., METHODS: From all admissions to NHS hospitals in Scotland between 1986 and 2001, those that were: drug misuse related, for people born between 1970 and 1986 and aged over 15 years (n=13 303), were selected. All subsequent admissions and registrations of death were linked to this dataset. Each admission was coded as homeless if the health board of residence was coded as 'no fixed abode'. 5-year survival after an admission was modelled using (1) life table and (2) proportional hazard models and then (3) differences in causes of deaths were explored., RESULTS: Immediately after a drugs-related hospital admission there was no difference in survival between the homeless and those with a 'fixed address'. However, over a 3-year period the risk for those who were homeless was 3.5 times greater (CI 95% 1.2 to 12.8). This elevated risk seemed to be particularly focused on the second year after an admission. The causes of death were similar for the two groups., CONCLUSION: Although a homeless hospital admission is associated with a greater risk of death for young drug users, it is also a point in time when a young person is in contact with public services. An attempt to link their discharge with housing services would seem a potentially productive policy.

N2  - The Housing First (HF) approach for homeless adults with serious mental illness has gained support as an alternative to the mainstream "Treatment First" (TF) approach. In this study, group differences were assessed using qualitative data from 27 HF and 48 TF clients. Dichotomous variables for substance use and substance abuse treatment utilization were created and examined using bivariate and logistic regression analyses. The HF group had significantly lower rates of substance use and substance abuse treatment utilization; they were also significantly less likely to leave their program. Housing First's positive impact is contrasted with the difficulties Treatment First programs have in retaining clients and helping them avoid substance use and possible relapse.

N2  - Follow-up rates reported among longitudinal studies that focus on runaway adolescents and their families are relatively low. Identifying factors associated with follow-up completion might be useful for improving follow-up rates and therefore study validity. The present study explored how individual- and family-level constructs, as well as research project activities, influence the follow-up completion rate among runaway adolescents (N = 140) and their primary caregiver. Results showed that follow-up completion rates decreased as the number of research assistants (RA) assigned to each case increased and as participants' address changes increased. Additionally, among adolescents, more frequent alcohol use was associated with lower follow-up rates. The current findings suggest that researchers should (1) design their research so that one RA is assigned to each specific case, and (2) adjust their retention strategies to account for the differences in follow-up rates based upon the participants' drug of choice and residential stability.

N2  - Baseline data were collected to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions on completion of the hepatitis A and B vaccine series among 664 sheltered and street-based homeless adults who were: (a) homeless; (b) recently (<1 year) discharged from prison; (c) discharged 1 year or more; and (d) never incarcerated. Group differences at baseline were assessed for socio-demographic characteristics, drug and alcohol use, sexual activity, mental health and public assistance. More than one-third of homeless persons (38%) reported prison time and 16% of the sample had been recently discharged from prison. Almost half of persons who were discharged from prison at least 1 year ago reported daily use of drugs and alcohol over the past 6 months compared to about 1 in 5 among those who were recently released from prison. As risk for HCV and HIV co-infection continues among homeless ex-offenders, HIV/HCV prevention efforts are needed for this population.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) of opiate users has been studied in treatment settings, where assistance for drug use was sought. In this study we ascertain factors related to HRQL of young opiate users recruited outside treatment facilities, considering both genders separately., METHODS: Current opiate users (18-30 y) were recruited in outdoor settings in three Spanish cities (Barcelona, Madrid, Seville). Standardised laptop interviews included socio-demographic data, drug use patterns, health related issues, the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) and the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP)., RESULTS: A total of 991 subjects (73% males), mean age = 25.7 years were interviewed. The mean global NHP score differed by gender (women: 41.2 (sd:23.8); men:34.1(sd:23.6);p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis was implemented separately by gender, variables independently related with global NHP score, both for males and females, were heroin and cocaine SDS scores. For women, only other drug related variables (alcohol intake and length of cocaine use) were independently associated with their HRQL. HIV+ males who suffered an opiate overdose or had psychiatric care in the last 12 months perceived their health as poorer, while those who had ever been in methadone treatment in the last 12 months perceived it as better. The model with both genders showed all factors for males plus quantity of alcohol and an interaction between gender and HIV status., CONCLUSIONS: Heroin users were found to be at a considerable risk of impaired HRQL, even in these young ages. A score approaching severity of dependence was the factor with the strongest relation with it.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to assess predictors of sexual and physical assault among homeless women. A multivariate, correlation design was utilized to identify independent correlates of adult physical and sexual assault. The sample consisted of 202 homeless women residing in shelters or living on the street in the Skid Row area of Los Angeles. Respondents reporting a history of child sexual abuse were almost four times more likely to report being sexually assaulted as adults and were almost two and one third times more likely to report being physically assaulted as adults. A range of factors increase homeless women's risk of adult physical and sexual victimization, including child sexual abuse, substance use, lifetime sex trade activity, and previous incarceration. It is important for homeless service providers to develop an individual risk profile for homeless women and to intervene in order to decrease their risk of re-victimization.

N2  - This study exploits an exogenous health shock-the birth of a child with a severe health condition that is considered by the medical community to be random-to investigate the effect of that shock on the family's housing situation. We use population-based data from an urban birth cohort study in the U.S. that oversampled non-marital births, resulting in a relatively disadvantaged sample that may be particularly susceptible to the effects of adverse life events. The health conditions were recorded in the infants' hospital medical records and coded by a pediatric consultant to capture conditions that are considered both severe and random. Seven different housing outcomes in the domains of quality, crowding, and stability were assessed from maternal interviews and in-home assessments when the children were 3 years old. We found that poor child health increases the likelihood of both overcrowding and homelessness and that it may also increase the likelihood of having inadequate utilities and generally poor housing quality. The effect sizes ranged from 1 to 17 percentage points, depending on the measure of poor child health and housing outcome. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Delivery of effective primary, secondary, and tertiary injury prevention in homeless populations is complex and could be greatly aided by an improved understanding of contributing factors., METHODS: Injury and health conditions were examined for hospitalized New York City homeless persons (n = 326,073) and low socioeconomic status (SES) housed residents (n = 1,202,622) using 2000 to 2002 New York statewide hospital discharge data (Statewide Program and Research Cooperative System). Age- and gender-adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated within age groups of 0.1 years to 9 years, 10 years to 19 years, 20 years to 64 years, and >=65 years, with low SES housed as the comparison group., RESULTS: Comorbid conditions, injury, and injury mechanisms varied by age, gender, race or ethnicity, and housing status. Odds of unintentional injury in homeless versus low SES housed were higher in younger children aged 0 years to 9 years (1.34, 1.27-1.42), adults (1.13, 1.09-1.18), and elderly (1.25, 1.20-1.30). Falls were increased by 30% in children, 14% in adolescents or teenagers, and 47% in the elderly. More than one-quarter (26.9%) of fall hospitalizations in homeless children younger than 5 years were due to falls from furniture with more than threefold differences observed in both 3 year and 4 year olds (p = 0.0001). Several comorbid conditions with potential to complicate injury and postinjury care were increased in homeless including nutritional deficiencies, infections, alcohol and drug use, and mental disorders., CONCLUSIONS: Although homelessness presents unique, highly complex social and health issues that tend to overshadow the need for and the value of injury prevention, this study highlights potentially fruitful areas for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.

N2  - The elopement of a child with Asperger syndrome was assessed using functional analyses and was treated in two school settings (classroom and resource room). Functional analyses indicated that elopement was maintained by access to attention in the resource room and obtaining a preferred activity in the classroom. Attention- and tangible-based interventions were compared in an alternating treatments design in both settings. Results validated the findings of the functional analyses. Implications for the assessment and treatment of elopement are discussed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Few interventions have focused on improving end-of-life care for underserved populations, such as homeless persons., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether homeless persons will complete a counseling session on advance care planning and fill out a legal advance directive designed to assess care preferences and preserve the dignity of marginalized persons., DESIGN: Prospective, single-blind, randomized trial comparing self-guided completion of an advance directive with professionally assisted advance care planning. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00546884), SETTING: 8 sites serving homeless persons in Minneapolis, Minnesota., PARTICIPANTS: 262 homeless persons recruited between November 2007 and August 2008., INTERVENTION: Minimal, self-guided intervention consisting of advance directive forms and written educational information versus a one-on-one advance planning intervention consisting of counseling and completing an advance directive with a social worker., MEASUREMENTS: Rate of advance directive completion, assessed by inspection of completed documents., RESULTS: The overall completion rate for advance directives was 26.7% (95% CI, 21.5% to 32.5%), with a higher rate in the counselor-guided group (37.9%) than in the self-guided group (12.8%) (CI of adjusted difference, 15.3 to 34.3 percentage points). This difference persisted across all sites and most subgroups. The advance directive's 4 clinical scenarios found a preference for surrogate decision making in 29% to 34% of written responses., LIMITATIONS: Sampling was limited to a more stable subset of the homeless population in Minneapolis and may have been subject to selection bias. Modest compensation to complete the preintervention survey could have influenced participants to complete advance directives., CONCLUSION: Both a simple and complex intervention successfully engaged a diverse sample of homeless persons in advance care planning. One-on-one assistance significantly increased the completion rate. Homeless persons can respond to an intervention to plan for end-of-life care and can express specific preferences for care or a surrogate decision maker, but additional studies are needed to assess the effect of these directives on subsequent care., PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Institute for Nursing Research and National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities.

N2  - A retrospective secondary data analysis of the National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients database was conducted to identify the demographic characteristics and correlates associated with reported need for dental care among people who are homeless in the United States. Overall, 10% of people who were homeless reported that dental care was their most needed service. Of these, 17% had a dental visit within the previous 12 months, 52% were racial/ethnic minorities, 76% lived in a central city, and 26% were veterans. The unadjusted odds for reporting a need for dental care was highest among veterans who were homeless and those whose last dental visit occurred more than 12 months ago. Compared to nonveterans who were homeless, veterans had twice the adjusted odds for reporting a need for dental care. The adjusted odds for reporting a need for dental care were lowest for those with dental insurance. Evaluation of the data suggests that dental insurance was associated with reporting lower need for dental care. Veterans who were homeless reported higher odds for dental care. Strengthening existing oral health-care programs sensitive to the needs of people who are homeless may improve their oral health and reduce their dental-disease-related morbidity.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To measure the prevalence of HIV/AIDS risk behaviors and related factors in a large, probability-based sample of boys and girls aged 12-17 years living on the streets of Egypt's largest urban centers of Greater Cairo and Alexandria., METHODS: Time-location sampling (TLS) was used to recruit a cross-sectional sample of street children. Procedures entailed using key informants and field observation to create a sampling frame of locations at predetermined time intervals of the day, where street children congregate in the two cities, selecting a random sample of time-locations from the complete list, and intercepting children in the selected time-locations to assess eligibility and conduct interviews. Interviews gathered basic demographic information, life events on the street (including violence, abuse, forced sex), sexual and drug use behaviors, and HIV/AIDS knowledge., RESULTS: A total of 857 street children were enrolled in the two cities, with an age, sex, and time-location composition matching the sampling frame. The majority of these children had faced harassment or abuse (93%) typically by police and other street children, had used drugs (62%), and, among the older adolescents, were sexually active (67%). Among the sexually active 15-17-year-olds, most reported multiple partners (54%) and never using condoms (52%). Most girls (53% in Greater Cairo and 90% in Alexandria) had experienced sexual abuse. The majority of street children experienced more than one of these risks. Overlaps with populations at highest risk for HIV were substantial, namely men who have sex with men, commercial sex workers, and injection drug users., CONCLUSION: Our study using a randomized TLS approach produced a rigorous, diverse, probability-based sample of street children and documented very high levels of multiple concurrent risks. Our findings strongly advocate for multiple services including those addressing HIV and STI prevention and care, substance use, shelters, and sensitization of authorities to the plight of street children in Egypt.

A1  - Finfgeld-Connett, Deborah
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - The purpose of this investigation was to more comprehensively articulate the experiences of homeless women and make evidence-based inferences regarding optimal social services. This study was conducted using qualitative meta-synthesis methods. As youth, homeless women experience challenging circumstances that leave them ill-prepared to prevent and resolve homelessness in adulthood. Resolution of homelessness occurs in iterative stages: crisis, assessment, and sustained action. To enhance forward progression through these stages, nurses are encouraged to promote empowerment in concordance with the Transtheoretical and Harm Reduction Models. Services that are highly valued include physical and mental health care and child care assistance.

T1  - Completion and subject loss within an intensive hepatitis vaccination intervention among homeless adults: the role of risk factors, demographics, and psychosocial variables.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Unprotected sexual behavior, needle sharing, and a prison history are major correlates of hepatitis B Virus (HBV). These risk factors are common among homeless people who also have elevated rates of HBV. We examine whether these behaviors were associated with completion or loss to follow-up of the most intensive and successful condition of a 3-arm HBV vaccination intervention. Significant results would imply that those most in need are the least compliant. Contributions of baseline demographics, physical health, psychosocial variables, and health beliefs were also assessed., DESIGN: Three-hundred thirty-one adults from Los Angeles' Skid Row were assigned to nurse-case-managed sessions with hepatitis education, incentives, and tracking. Successive predictive structural equation models assessed the amount of variance accounted for by the risk variables, demographics, and the health-related variables., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Completion of 3 injections by 6 months; and (2) loss to a 6-month follow-up questionnaire., RESULTS: The 3 risk factors explained 2% of the variance in completion and 1% of the variance in loss. Adding the other variables increased the variance explained to 14% for completion and 13% for loss. African American ethnicity, positive coping, social support, poorer health, no prison history, and greater efficacy significantly predicted completion. White ethnicity, less social support, better health, and less intention to complete predicted participant loss., CONCLUSION: The program was not strongly rejected differentially as a function of preexisting hepatitis B risk behaviors. Programs designed for homeless people should include malleable psychosocial and health belief model variables. These aspects of the lives of homeless people provide leverage points for future interventions. Copyright (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved.

N2  - This study characterizes the prevalence of drug use among Filipino street children compared with Filipino non-street children. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 311 street children and 528 non-street children aged 13 to 17 years. Participants were enrolled through 4 nonprofit organizations and 3 high schools located in Manila, Philippines. After adjustment for age and sex, street children with little or no contact with their families were 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.7-2.3) times more likely to smoke tobacco, 1.3 (95% CI = 1.2-1.5) times more likely to use alcohol, 36.7 (95% CI = 16.4-82.0) times more likely to use inhalants, and 5.5 (95% CI = 3.6-8.2) times more likely to use illegal drugs than their non-street counterparts. Street children who maintained contact with their families, compared with non-street children, were 8.7 (95% CI = 3.9-19.4) times more likely to use inhalants and 2.8 (95% CI = 1.7-4.6) times more likely to use illegal drugs. There was no significant difference in tobacco or alcohol use between street children who maintained contact with their families and non-street children. All street children were significantly more likely to have been given or sold a drug in the past 30 days and to have received drug education compared with non-street children. Filipino street children are at greater risk of abusing drugs than are non-street children, with street children who do not maintain family contact being at greatest risk.

N2  - BACKGROUND: HIV prevention intervention efficacy is often assessed in the short term. Thus, we conducted a long-term (mean 4.4 years) follow-up of a woman-focused HIV intervention for African American crack smokers, for which we had previously observed beneficial short-term gains., METHODS: 455 out-of-treatment African American women in central North Carolina participated in a randomized field experiment and were followed up to determine sustainability of intervention effects across three conditions: the woman-focused intervention, a modified NIDA intervention, and a delayed-treatment control condition. We compared these groups in terms of HIV risk behavior at short-term follow-up (STFU; 3-6 months) and long-term follow-up (LTFU; average 4 years)., RESULTS: The analyses revealed two distinct groups at STFU: women who either eliminated or greatly reduced their risk behaviors (low-risk class) and women who retained high levels of risk across multiple risk domains (high-risk class). At STFU, women in the woman-focused intervention were more likely to be in the low HIV risk group than the women in control conditions, but this effect was not statistically significant at LTFU. However, low-risk participants at STFU were less likely to be retained at LTFU, and this retention rate was lowest among women in the woman-focused intervention., CONCLUSIONS: Short-term intervention effects were not observed over 4 years later, possibly due to differential retention across conditions. The retention of the highest risk women presents an opportunity to extend intervention effects through booster sessions for these women. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Homelessness and poverty can present serious health issues for children, including those associated with developmental delays. Early identification and intervention may decrease risk associated with delayed development. Parent-completed measures have been used to help screen for children's development, but little is known about how they may enhance early detection with homeless children. The primary aims of this pilot study were to describe growth and developmental characteristics of homeless children and to compare a parent-completed measure with professionally-conducted developmental screening results. A prospective, comparative study was conducted with 20 homeless mothers and their 21 children. Health professionals used the Denver Developmental Screening Test II, identifying nine children with possible language delay. Mothers completed the Ages and Stages Questionnaires and identified three areas of concern: fine motor (n = 9), communication/language (n = 4), and problem solving (n = 4). The percentage agreement between these two tools was strongest in gross motor (95%) and personal social development (95%) but weakest in language development (67%). While it is essential for all children, developmental screening is particularly crucial for homeless children because of increased risks related to poverty and homelessness. Nurses and nurse practitioners are in a unique position to assess applicability of such instruments and to provide critically needed interventions for these children.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Behavioral intervention research has lagged behind biomedical research in developing principles for defining, categorizing, identifying, reporting, and monitoring adverse events and unanticipated problems., PURPOSE: In this article we present a set of principles for defining adverse events and how they were applied in a large national multi-site family therapy study for substance-using adolescents, The Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT) Effectiveness Study., METHODS: The BSFT Effectiveness study tested how BSFT compares to Treatment as Usual (TAU) for the treatment of drug-abusing adolescents. During protocol development, experts in the BSFT intervention, medical safety officers, ethicists and senior investigators defined the procedures for identifying, tracking and reporting adverse events for drug using adolescents as well as their family members. During this process the team identified five key guiding principles., RESULTS: The five guiding principles that were used for defining adverse events in this behavioral trial were that that the adverse events should be validated and plausible, and that monitoring systems should assess relatedness, be systematic, and are a shared responsibility. The following non-serious adverse events were identified: arrest, school suspension and drop out, runaway, kicked out of home and violence. The serious adverse events in this study for the identified adolescent participant and all other consented family members were physical or sexual abuse, suicidal behavior, homicidal behavior, hospitalization (drug related or psychiatric related only) and death. The methods used in categorizing, identifying and reporting adverse events in the BSFT trial are outlined. More than 50% of the adolescent population (277/481 = 57.5 %) experienced an adverse event during the trial. Family members experienced less adverse events, (61/1338 = 4.5%). The most common event for the adolescent group was arrest (164/277= 59.2%), followed by school suspension/dropout (143/277 = 51.6%), and runaway (79/277= 28.5 %). For the family member group, the most common event was violence (25/ 61 = 40.9%) followed by arrest (13/61 = 21.3%). There was a significant difference in the presence of adverse events in family members that were randomized to BSFT 44/721 (6.1%) when compared to Treatment as Usual 17/617 (2.8%) (p = 0.004). A probable explanation for this is that there were more opportunities to identify adverse events for family members assigned to BSFT because family members attended therapy sessions. This difference may also represent the risk for family members that participate in an evidence-based family intervention like BSFT., LIMITATIONS: The utility of the principles outside of the BSFT trial is unknown., CONCLUSIONS: Based on the events reported in this trial, the efforts for monitoring and categorizing adverse events appeared justified and appropriate. The strategies and principles described in this paper may be useful for those developing safety plans for behavioral intervention research, and to family therapy researchers for assessing the safety of behavioral family interventions.

N2  - AIMS: Efforts to prevent youth from initiating injection drug use require an understanding of the drug use patterns that predispose to injecting. Here we identify such patterns and describe the circumstances of first injection among street youth., METHODS: From October 2005 to November 2007, data were collected for the At Risk Youth Study, a prospective cohort of 560 street-recruited youth aged 14-26 in Vancouver, Canada. Non-injection drug use behaviors were compared between those with and without a history of injection through multiple logistic regression. The circumstances of first injection were also examined in gender-stratified analyses., RESULTS: Youth who had previously injected were more likely to have engaged in non-injection use of heroin or of crystal methamphetamine. Daily users of marijuana were less likely to have injected. Among prior injectors, the median age of first injection was lower among females. Females were also more likely to have had a sexual partner present at first injection and to have become a regular injector within one week of initiation., CONCLUSION: Preventing transition to injection among street youth may require special attention to predisposing drug use patterns and should acknowledge gender differences in the circumstances of first injection.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Suicide prevention by mental health services requires an awareness of the antecedents of suicide amongst high risk groups such as psychiatric in-patients. The goal of this study was to describe the social and clinical characteristics of people who had absconded from an in-patient psychiatric ward prior to suicide, including aspects of the clinical care they received., METHODS: We carried out a national clinical survey based on a 10-year (1997-2006) sample of people in England and Wales who had died by suicide. Detailed data were collected on those who had been in contact with mental health services in the year before death., RESULTS: There were 1,851 cases of suicide by current psychiatric in-patients, 14% of all patient suicides. 1,292 (70%) occurred off the ward. Four hundred and sixty-nine of these patients died after absconding from the ward, representing 25% of all in-patient suicides and 38% of those that occurred off the ward. Absconding suicides were characterised by being young, unemployed and homeless compared to those who were off the ward with staff agreement. Schizophrenia was the most common diagnosis, and rates of previous violence and substance misuse were high. Absconders were proportionally more likely than in-patients on agreed leave to have been legally detained for treatment, non-compliant with medication, and to have died in the first week of admission. Whilst absconding patients were significantly more likely to have been under a high level of observation, clinicians reported more problems in observation due to either the ward design or other patients on the ward., CONCLUSION: Measures that may prevent absconding and subsequent suicide amongst in-patients might include tighter control of ward exits, and more intensive observation of patients, particularly in the early days of admission. Improving the ward environment to provide a supportive and less intimidating experience may contribute to reduced risk.

N2  - PURPOSE: To examine effects of the Runaway Intervention Program (RIP), a strengths-based home visiting, case management, and group support program for sexually assaulted or exploited young runaway girls; staffed by advanced-practice nurses, RIP aims to restore healthy developmental trajectories by reestablishing protective factors, reducing trauma responses, and lowering risk behaviors that are common sequelae of sexual violence., METHODS: Quasi-experimental study of RIP girls (N = 68) ages 12 to 15 (mean, 13.75 years), assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months for changes in family and school connectedness, other adult caring, self-esteem, emotional distress, suicidality, recent substance use, plus risky sexual behaviors. Responses at each time were also compared to nonabused and abused urban ninth-grade girls (mean age, 14.64, N = 12,775) from the 2004 Minnesota Student Survey (MSS). Analyses used paired t-tests, McNemars test, Wilcoxon sign-rank, chi-square, and Pearson's correlations., RESULTS: At entry, RIP girls were most like sexually abused MSS peers, with lower levels of protective factors and higher levels of distress and risk behaviors than nonabused MSS girls (p < .05 to p < .01). However, they saw significant improvements by 6 and 12 months, such that all measures of protective factors, positive development, distress, and risk behaviors more closely resembled nonabused MSS girls by 12 months. Of equal note, RIP girls with the greatest emotional distress, the lowest levels of connectedness, and lowest self-esteem at baseline demonstrated the greatest improvement (all p < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: This appears to be a promising intervention for restoring sexually abused runaway girls to a healthy developmental trajectory.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study used event-based analyses to examine how alcohol and drug use are associated with protected sex among women residing in temporary shelters in Los Angeles County., METHOD: Participants were 445 sexually active women age 18 and older who were sampled from 52 shelters serving homeless individuals. Data were collected through individual computer-assisted face-to-face structured interviews. Both between-subjects analyses (n = 445) and within-subjects analyses (n = 87) were used to examine the association between substance use and protected sex., RESULTS: In both within- and between-subjects analyses, women who drank alcohol before sex were significantly more likely to engage in protected sex compared with women who did not drink alcohol. However, there was no association between women's drug use, or their male partner's alcohol or drug use, and whether they engaged in protected sex. The higher likelihood of protected sex during events when women drank alcohol could be explained by partner choice (both analyses) and discussing condom use before sex (within-subjects analyses only)., CONCLUSIONS: These findings challenge the common belief that women's alcohol use before sex necessarily increases the likelihood of unprotected sex but are consistent with several previous studies suggesting that alcohol use may be associated with protected sex under certain conditions. Results from this study highlight the need to better understand the complexities of how alcohol use may influence the sexual behavior of impoverished women.

T1  - Running away experience and psychoactive substance use among adolescents in Taiwan: multi-city street outreach survey.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine: 1) the relationship between being a runaway and the time since the first absconding event and adolescent substance use; 2) whether different kinds of psychoactive substances have a different temporal relationship to the first absconding event; and 3) whether the various reasons for the first absconding event are associated with different risks of substance use., METHODS: Participants were drawn from the 2004-2006 nationwide outreach programs across 26 cities/towns in Taiwan. A total of 17,133 participants, age 12-18 years, who completed an anonymous questionnaire on their experience of running away and substances use and who were now living with their families, were included in the analysis., RESULTS: The lifetime risk of tobacco, alcohol, betel nut, and illegal drug/inhalant use increased steadily from adolescents who had experienced a trial runaway episode (one time lasting or= 2 times or lasting > 1 day), when compared to those who had never ran away. Adolescents who had their first running away experience > 6 months previously had a greater risk of betel nut or illegal drug/inhalant use over the past 6-months than those with a similar experience within the last 6 months. Both alcohol and tobacco use were most frequently initiated before the first running away, whereas both betel nut and illegal drug/inhalant use were most frequently initiated after this event. When adolescents who were fleeing an unsatisfactory home life were compared to those who ran away for excitement, the risk of alcohol use was similar but the former tended to have a higher risk of tobacco, betel nut, and illegal drug/inhalant use., CONCLUSIONS: More significant running away and a longer time since the first absconding experience were associated with more advanced substance involvement among adolescents now living in a family setting. Once adolescents had left home, they developed additional psychoactive substance problems, regardless of their reasons for running away. These findings have implications for caregivers, teachers, and healthcare workers when trying to prevent and/or intervening in adolescent substance use.

N2  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to find out whether young men exempted from compulsory military or civil service constitute a group of young men in need of psychosocial support from the social and health services., METHODS: The study involved a total of 356 men exempted from military or civil service and 440 young men conscripted into service. The research data were collected using questionnaires and register data., RESULTS: Men exempted from military or civil service differed from conscripts in terms of psychosocial well-being. Compared with conscripts, they had already been in a more disadvantaged position with regard to their childhood living conditions. As young adults, they had met with a greater number of mental and social problems than conscripts: alcohol-related problems, unemployment, financial problems, homelessness, lack of social support and psychological distress. Young men exempted from service typically suffered from an accumulation of problems. Diverse problems were common particularly among men who had interrupted their service. There was a moderate correlation between current and childhood adversities., CONCLUSIONS: Men exempted from military or civil service comprise a group with a wide range of psychosocial problems and are a target group for supportive interventions. Special attention should be paid to the prevention of problems and promotion of well-being of men who interrupt their service. The accumulation of problems poses a challenge for the development of such interventions.

N2  - According to a cohort study conducted in Montreal, Quebec from 1995 to 2000, the mortality rate among street youth was 921/100,000 person-years. Several new community initiatives aiming to increase access to housing and to social and health services for the homeless were implemented in the city between 2000 and 2003. This study aims to update the mortality rate estimate for the period 2001-2006 and to examine factors that could explain a difference between rates, if any. A second cohort study was conducted between 2001 and 2006. The Cohort 2 mortality rate was computed and compared with the Cohort 1 rate. Several analyses were then carried out: (1) mortality rates in the general population were compared with street youth rates using standardized mortality ratios (SMR); (2) Cohorts 1 and 2 distributions of risk factors for mortality were examined, and their effects were assessed using multivariate proportional hazards regression analyses carried out on a combined Cohorts 1 and 2 dataset. Mortality rate among street youth decreased by 79% while it declined by only 19% in the general population; the SMR for Cohort 1 was higher than for Cohort 2 (11.6 versus 3.0). Multivariate proportional hazards regression analyses yielded estimates that were close to the model's estimates based on Cohort 1 data only, and participation in Cohort 1 was an independent predictor of mortality, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 9.0. The mortality decline cannot be completely explained by a similar decrease among the general population or by a difference in distribution of risk factors for mortality between the two cohorts. Field workers suggested that the decrease in heroin consumption they had observed in the streets might have contributed to the mortality decline. We then performed additional analyses which showed that even though the proportion of street youth currently using heroin decreased significantly between 1995 and 2005, the association between heroin use and mortality was not significant (adjusted hazard ratio of 0.9; 95% CI, 0.4 to 2.3). It seems that various factors could have contributed to the decline in mortality rates among street youth, one plausible factor being the implementation of new services for the homeless. This study underscores the importance of monitoring risky behaviors among vulnerable populations to ensure that morbidity and mortality data among these populations is correctly interpreted. Setting up a system to monitor the drug market could improve the quality of information collected.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Low-income, urban, ethnic minority children have higher rates of asthma, more severe symptoms, and more management issues, as well as high risk for academic and behavior problems. This study focused on asthma reported in young children who resided in a family emergency homeless shelter. Asthma rates were considered along with their relation to hospitalization and emergency department use and behavior that is important for school success, including cognitive function, conduct, and academic functioning., METHODS: A total of 104 children (age 4.0-7.5 years) and parents were recruited while residing in an urban emergency homeless shelter for families. Children had no previously identified developmental delays and spoke English proficiently. Parents reported whether the child experienced asthma, as well as emergency department use and hospitalization. Parents and teachers completed measures of child inattention/hyperactivity and behavior problems. Cognitive function of children was directly assessed., RESULTS: Asthma was reported for 27.9% of children, approximately 3 times the national average. Children with asthma had been hospitalized more often, showed higher levels of inattention/hyperactivity and behavior problems, and evidenced lower academic functioning., CONCLUSIONS: Young children in homeless family emergency shelters have high rates of asthma and related problems that could lead to higher hospitalization rates, more behavioral problems, and lower academic functioning at school. Screening and treatment of children who stay in emergency family shelters may be particularly important for reducing risks associated with asthma in highly mobile, low-income families.

N2  - Homelessness affects HIV risk and health, but little is known about the longitudinal effects of rental assistance on the housing status and health of homeless and unstably housed people living with HIV/AIDS. Homeless/unstably housed people living with HIV/AIDS (N = 630) were randomly assigned to immediate Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS (HOPWA) rental assistance or customary care. Self-reported data, CD4, and HIV viral load were collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Results showed that housing status improved in both groups, with greater improvement occurring in the treatment group. At 18 months, 51% of the comparison group had their own housing, limiting statistical power. Intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated significant reductions in medical care utilization and improvements in self-reported physical and mental health; significant differential change benefiting the treatment group was observed for depression and perceived stress. Significant differences between homeless and stably housed participants were found in as-treated analyses for health care utilization, mental health, and physical health. HOPWA rental assistance improves housing status and, in some cases, health outcomes of homeless and unstably housed people living with HIV/AIDS.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to compare measures of addiction and transience among street youth in three disparate urban areas: Los Angeles, California; Austin, Texas; and St. Louis, Missouri. Street youth from Los Angeles (n = 50), Austin (n = 50) and St. Louis (n = 46) were recruited using comparable engagement strategies. Youth were interviewed concerning use of alcohol and other substances and their level of transience. Youth from each city were compared using chi-squares and multinomial logistic regression. Results reveal that youth in each city differed in ethnicity, age, educational status, length of time homeless, and substance abuse and dependence. Comparisons across youth in three cities suggest that length of homelessness and drug dependence/abuse significantly differentiate between low, moderate and high transience. Understanding the heterogeneity of this population as well as the relationship between addiction and transience has implications for providing national substance abuse responses.

N2  - The objective of the study was to evaluate voice characteristics of children engaged in street selling, which involves an essentially professional use of voice in this population. A controlled cross-sectional study was carried out. A randomly chosen sample of 200 school children with a history of street selling assisted by public social services and 400 school children without this experience was selected. Seven- to 10-year-old children of both sexes were studied. Both groups were interviewed and given vocal assessment (auditory-perceptual assessment and spectrographic acoustic measures) and otorhinolaryngological evaluation (physical and videonasolaryngoscopic examination). Children with abnormal results in both groups were compared using chi(2) (Chi-squared test). The significance level was established at 5% (P<0.05). Voice problems were detected more frequently in working children (106-53%) than in regular school children (90-22.5%). The control group achieved better school performance as more children in this group attend school regularly than street children, although age-for-grade deficit was similar. The control group had more access to medical visits (80-40%) and treatment with a doctor (34-17%). Language assessment has shown that the control group had more dysphonia (73-37%) and myofunctional orofacial disorders (20-10%). Street children had more normal voice but had more nasal disorders and greater glottal closure than the school control group. Voice disorders were present in both groups, but less frequently in street children. Although subject to inadequate living conditions, street children had better voice quality than the control group. An explanation could be that by adapting their voice professionally for selling goods in the streets, they developed adequate resilience to their difficult living conditions.

T1  - Discrepancies in households and other stakeholders viewpoints on the food security experience: a gap to address.

N2  - This paper reports results from a case study on household food insecurity needs and the interventions that address them. It aimed at comparing households' perceptions on food insecurity experience and vulnerability to those of other stakeholders: community workers, programme managers and representatives from donor agencies. Semi-structured interviews with 55 households and 59 other stakeholders were conducted. Content analysis was performed, using a framework encompassing food sufficiency, characterization of household food insecurity and vulnerability of households to food insecurity. Overall, the results draw attention to a gap between households and the other stakeholders, where the later do not seem always able to assess the realities of food-insecure households. Other areas of divergences include: characteristics of food insecurity, relative importance of various risk factors related to food insecurity and the effectiveness of the community assistance to enhance the households' ability to face food insecurity. These divergent perceptions may jeopardize the implementation of sustainable solutions to food insecurity. Training of stakeholders for a better assessment of households' experience and needs, and systematic evaluation of interventions, appear urgent and highly relevant for an adequate response to households' needs. Collaboration between all stakeholders should lead to knowledge sharing and advocacy for policies dedicated to poverty reduction.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The street children, a marginalised and vulnerable population to poor health, have grown all over the world and also in our country. The continuous exposure to harsh environment and nature of their life style threatens their mental, physical, social and spiritual well being. With the increasing number the problem is also growing at an alarming proportion. It is therefore important to have baseline data on their health problems., OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to identify the physical health problems among the street children of Dharan Municipality, Nepal., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross sectional descriptive study. Forty eight subjects were included in the study. Research instruments included an interview schedule, physical health examination performa and lab investigations (i.e. blood for haemoglobin, urine routine examination/microscopic examination, stool routine examination/ microscopic examination)., RESULTS: Study results showed that 68.8% of the street children were between 11-15 years of age, 95.8% were males. Out of the total subjects 81.2% were found to be rag pickers. Research findings reveal that 100% of the subjects had at least one or more health problems. The study revealed that majority 87.5% had the habit of cigarette smoking, 50% had habit of consuming alcohol and 72.9% had the habit of taking drug. Dendrite (glue sniffing) was the only drug used by the respondents in this study. The most common health problems were head lice infestation (81.2%), headache (66.7%), cut injury (60.4%), common cold (52.1%), dental caries (52%), burning micturation (47.9%), cough (47.9%), underweight (43.8%), abdominal pain (39.6%), tinnitus (37.55%), gum bleeding (33.3%), joint pain (31.2%), eye inflammation (25%), leg cramps (25%), palpable lymph nodes (25%), chest pain (18.8%), skin lesions (16.7%), abnormal vision (8.3%)., CONCLUSION: Most of the diseases were due to poor health habits. It was found that the nature of work, their life styles and the different types of behaviour they adapt finally lead them to many health problems. The health problem can be prevented, if an integrated program that involves all the issues are developed and implemented.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: the purpose of this research was to determine the feasibility of engaging incarcerated women in community-based participatory research and to identify, by and with the women, the health concerns to be addressed., DESIGN: the integration of primary health care, community-based participatory research, a settings approach to health promotion and transformative action research guided the overall design of this study., PARTICIPANTS: Incarcerated women, correctional centre staff and academic researchers participated collaboratively. Setting . The study was conducted in the main short sentence (two years or less) minimum/medium security women's correctional centre in a Canadian province., RESULTS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 incarcerated women; in-depth group interviews were facilitated with 16 correctional centre staff. Twenty-one themes, which emerged from participatory, inductive and content analysis of the data, were presented at a face-to-face meeting attended by 120 incarcerated women, 10 correctional centre staff and 5 academic researchers. Underlying values and principles for the project were identified prior to a discussion of the results. During the course of this meeting, the themes were converged into five major categories: addictions and mental health; HIV, hepatitis and infections; health care in prison; life skills and re-entry into society (including homelessness and housing); and children, family and relationships. Numerous suggestions for health interventions and participatory projects were generated, each relating to one of the five major categories., CONCLUSIONS: this study was unique in that, to our knowledge, no other studies have utilized community-based participatory research methods in which incarcerated women played a role in designing the research questions and tools, collecting the data, analyzing the data, interpreting the data and authoring the publications and presentations. This study demonstrated that it is feasible for incarcerated women to engage in developing and utilizing community-based participatory research methods and that these methods can be grounded in a settings approach to whole prison health promotion.

A1  - Barajas, R Gabriela
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - The present study used data from 132 families that were homeless and a comparison group of 434 housed families in order to compare family functioning across the two groups. Family functioning was assessed by family support workers when the families sought help from one of seven family service agencies in Washington, DC. Multiple regression models showed that there were few differences between homeless and housed families; a difference that did emerge showed that homeless families fared better than housed families in terms of children's developmental stimulation. However, when considering the compounding effects of additional family risk factors, adverse effects of homelessness were observed. As compared with housed families, homeless families with a history of parental mental illness had limited access to support networks and poorer interactions with their children. Poor financial and living conditions were observed among homeless families with histories of substance use. Policy implications and directions for future research are discussed.

T1  - A fortified street food to prevent nutritional deficiencies in homeless men in France.
A1  - Darmon, Nicole
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a food policy approach to prevent nutritional deficiencies and malnutrition in homeless men in France., STUDY POPULATION AND METHODS: A dietary survey was conducted among homeless men visiting an emergency shelter in Paris to assess their nutritional status and the quality of food aid provided. The use of a fortified food easy to eat in the street was identified as the best strategy to improve nutrient intake in this population. A fortified street food was therefore designed and its acceptability was tested in eight emergency centers., RESULTS: The dietary survey showed that there is a high frequency of malnutrition and inadequate intake of vitamins and minerals in homeless men in France although they are receiving food aid. A chocolate-flavored spread, naturally rich in potassium and n-3 fatty acids and fortified with nutritional doses of calcium, zinc, vitamins C, D, E, B(12), thiamin, niacin and folic acid was designed. It presents multiple advantages in the context of homeless nutrition: good resistance to bacterial contamination, a suitable viscosity for people with limited chewing capacity and high energy density. The acceptability study showed that approximately two thirds of the homeless men visiting emergency centers in Paris would consume the fortified food often, or daily, if available. Another advantage of this fortified street food is its high quality/price ratio, demonstrated by linear programming analysis in the present study., CONCLUSIONS: Encouraging the use of fortified street foods in food aid programs is a practical and economic way to prevent nutritional deficiencies in homeless individuals.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the pandemic flu, Influenza A H1N1 (Swine Flu) in early 2009, provided a major challenge to health services around the world. Previous pandemics have led to stockpiling of goods, the victimisation of particular population groups, and the cancellation of travel and the boycotting of particular foods (e.g. pork). We examined initial behavioural and attitudinal responses towards Influenza A, H1N1 ("Swine flu") in the six days following the WHO pandemic alert level 5, and regional differences in these responses., METHODS: 328 respondents completed a cross-sectional Internet or paper-based questionnaire study in Malaysia (N = 180) or Europe (N = 148). Measures assessed changes in transport usage, purchase of preparatory goods for a pandemic, perceived risk groups, indicators of anxiety, assessed estimated mortality rates for seasonal flu, effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccination, and changes in pork consumption, RESULTS: 26% of the respondents were 'very concerned' about being a flu victim (42% Malaysians, 5% Europeans, p < .001). 36% reported reduced public transport use (48% Malaysia, 22% Europe, p < .001), 39% flight cancellations (56% Malaysia, 17% Europe, p < .001). 8% had purchased preparatory materials (e.g. face masks: 8% Malaysia, 7% Europe), 41% Malaysia (15% Europe) intended to do so (p < .001). 63% of Europeans, 19% of Malaysians had discussed the pandemic with friends (p < .001). Groups seen as at 'high risk' of infection included the immune compromised (mentioned by 87% respondents), pig farmers (70%), elderly (57%), prostitutes/highly sexually active (53%), and the homeless (53%). In data collected only in Europe, 64% greatly underestimated the mortality rates of seasonal flu, 26% believed seasonal flu vaccination gave protection against swine flu. 7% had reduced/stopped eating pork. 3% had purchased anti-viral drugs for use at home, while 32% intended to do so if the pandemic worsened., CONCLUSION: Initial responses to Influenza A show large regional differences in anxiety, with Malaysians more anxious and more likely to reduce travel and to buy masks and food. Discussions with family and friends may reinforce existing anxiety levels. Particular groups (homosexuals, prostitutes, the homeless) are perceived as at greater risk, potentially leading to increased prejudice during a pandemic. Europeans underestimated mortality of seasonal flu, and require more information about the protection given by seasonal flu inoculation.

N2  - Prior research suggests that the interconnections between substance use, HIV risk and lack of adherence to HIV medications are especially strong among homeless individuals. Thus, study of these interconnections warrants public health attention. The objectives of this paper are to describe patterns of alcohol and drug use, associations between substance use and participation in high-risk sex, and associations between substance use and adherence to HIV treatment regimens among a sample of 602 homeless or unstably housed HIV-seropositive individuals who are part of a housing-based intervention--the Housing and Health Study. Participants experienced high levels of substance use. Significant associations were found between substance use and adherence to HIV treatment medications, and between substance use and high-risk sexual practices within the entire group. Group analyses by sexual orientation/gender show that the association between substance use and treatment adherence is found primarily among heterosexual males whereas the relationship between several drugs and high-risk sexual practices is strongest among gay and bisexual men. Health professionals working with HIV-seropositive individuals should routinely ascertain housing status and screen for substance use and risky sex.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that youth who are homeless engage in high-risk behaviors. However, there has been little information published on nutritional and physical activity behaviors in this population, and studies comparing homeless youth in school with their non-homeless peers are scarce. This study compares weight-related risk behaviors of public high school students in Massachusetts based on homeless status., METHODS: We obtained data from 3264 9th through 12th grade students who participated in the 2005 Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Multivariable logistic regression, controlling for gender, grade, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation, was performed to assess the relationship between homeless status as defined by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and weight-related indicators. Analyses were weighted and adjusted for the multistage complex sampling design., RESULTS: Of this sample, 4.2% reported being homeless (n = 152). Higher prevalence of homelessness was found among males, racial/ethnic minorities, sexual minorities, and students who were not in a traditional grade level. The distribution of body mass index was similar among students who were homeless and non-homeless (underweight 4.0 and 3.0%, and overweight 27.1 and 27.1%, respectively). Homeless students were more likely than non-homeless students to report disordered weight-control behaviors including fasting (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.5) and diet pill use (aOR 3.3, 95% CI 1.6-6.9)., CONCLUSIONS: More than 4% of public high school students in Massachusetts meet the federal definition of homelessness. These students are at high risk for disordered weight-control behaviors. Policy decisions at the school, state, and federal levels should make a concerted effort to target these students with social services and nutritional interventions.

N2  - SETTING: The United States (US) National Tuberculosis Surveillance System (NTSS), including 50 states, District of Columbia, and New York City., OBJECTIVE: To examine disparities in characteristics and rates of Asian/Pacific Islander (API) and non-Hispanic White tuberculosis (TB) patients., DESIGN: Descriptive analysis and logistic regression of selected 1993-2006 NTSS data. US Census Bureau Zip Code Tabulation Areas and geographic information system were used to compare API and non-Hispanic White TB patients by population density., RESULT: Of 253,299 TB cases, 19.8% were APIs and 23.2% were Whites; 94.2% APIs and 11.9% Whites were foreign-born. Factors that were most often associated with APIs were being female, age 15-24 years, extra-pulmonary TB, and drug resistance. APIs were less likely than Whites to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, homeless, substance abusers, or on directly observed therapy. From 1993 to 2006, the API TB case rate declined by 42.9% vs. 66.6% in Whites (P < 0.01). Being foreign-born was the strongest risk factor for TB, regardless of population densities, but APIs were more likely to have TB than foreign-born Whites at lower population densities., CONCLUSION: Disparities in TB exist among US APIs and non-Hispanic Whites. TB program officials should allocate programs appropriately for foreign-born APIs in lower population density areas.

N2  - AIMS: The public health problems precipitating eviction are understudied and no systemic data have been collected. We aim to identify the magnitude of eviction and the characteristics and social medical risk factors of households at risk in Amsterdam. This will help inform policies designed to prevent eviction., METHODS: In 2003, case workers of housing associations dealing with rent arrears, and case workers of nuisance control care networks, were interviewed and completed questionnaires about households at risk of eviction. Questionnaires included the processes that resulted in eviction and the characteristics and social medical problems of the households involved. Evicted households were compared with non-evicted households., RESULTS: In Amsterdam, over recent years 1,400 eviction, or four per 1,000 dwellings, took place annually. Of 275 households with rent arrears, 132 were evicted. Of 190 nuisance households, 136 were evicted. In both groups, the largest household group were single male tenants between 25 and 44 years. For those reporting rent arrears, social problems were reported in 71%, medical problems in 23%; independent risk factors for eviction were being of Dutch origin (OR 2.38 (1.30-4.36)) and having a drug-addiction problem (OR 3.58 (0.96-13.39)). For the nuisance households, social problems were reported in 46% and medical problems in 82%, while financial difficulties were a risk factor for eviction (OR: 8.04 (1.05-61.7))., CONCLUSIONS: In Amsterdam, households at risk of eviction consisted mainly of single (Dutch) men, aged between 25 and 44 years, often with a combination of social and medical problems. Financial difficulties and drug addiction were independent risk factors for eviction. Because of the social medical problems that were prevalent, for prevention practice eviction should be considered both a socioeconomic and a public health problem. Preventing eviction deserves full attention as a potential effective public health intervention.

N2  - Homeless youths are often vulnerable to limited support resources and loneliness. Peers are a potent source of social support. A support intervention for homeless youths was designed to optimize peer influence and was pilot tested. The intervention was based on an initial assessment of support needs and intervention preferences from the perspective of 36 homeless youths and 27 service providers. Based on the results, a 20-week pilot intervention program was designed, consisting of 4 support groups, optional one-on-one support, group recreational activities, and meals. Support was provided by professional and peer mentors, including formerly homeless youths. A total of 56 homeless youths aged 16 to 24 took part. Participants completed pre-, mid-, and post-test quantitative measures and qualitative interviews. In spite of challenges due primarily to attrition, the youths reported enhanced health behaviours, improved mental well-being, decreased loneliness, expanded social network, increased coping skills, enhanced self-efficacy, and diminished use of drugs and alcohol. Further research could focus on replication at other sites with a larger sample.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - BACKGROUND: A single-site study described differences between homeless and non-homeless patient utilization of the emergency department (ED). No prior study has examined ED use by the homeless on a national level., OBJECTIVE: To analyze national ED utilization by homeless patients., METHODS: Data were extracted from the 2005 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. SAS callable SUDAAN was used to produce national estimates. Results . Of the 115 million visits to national EDs in 2005, 472,922 were made by homeless patients. In comparison with the non-homeless, these patients were more likely to arrive by ambulance and to be uninsured. Both groups had similar admission rates and triage urgency, with a trend toward increased diagnostic testing for homeless patients., CONCLUSION: Homeless patients who visited EDs in 2005 were more likely to arrive by ambulance despite similar triage urgency and admission rates compared with the non-homeless, and were less likely to be insured.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Many people with schizophrenia remain untreated in the community. Long-term mortality and suicidal behaviour among never-treated individuals with schizophrenia in the community are unknown., AIMS: To explore 10-year mortality and suicidal behaviour among never-treated individuals with schizophrenia., METHOD: We used data from a 10-year prospective follow-up study (1994-2004) among people with schizophrenia in Xinjin County, Chengdu, China., RESULTS: The mortality rate for never-treated individuals with schizophrenia was 2761 per 100 000 person-years during follow-up. There were no significant differences of rates of suicide and all-cause mortality between never-treated and treated individuals. The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) for never-treated people was 10.4 (95% CI 7.2-15.2) and for treated individuals 6.5 (95% CI 5.2-8.5). Compared with treated people, never-treated individuals were more likely to be older, poorer, have a longer duration of illness, marked symptoms and fewer family members., CONCLUSIONS: The never-treated individuals have similar mortality to and a higher proportion of marked symptoms than treated people, which may reflect the poor outcome of the individuals without treatment. The higher rates of mortality, homelessness and never being treated among people with schizophrenia in low- and middle-income nations might challenge presumed wisdom about schizophrenia outcomes in these countries.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Treatment evaluation for alcohol problem, runaway adolescents and their families is rare. This study recruited primary alcohol problem adolescents (N = 119) and their primary caretakers from two runaway shelters and assigned them to (a) home-based ecologically based family therapy (EBFT), (b) office-based functional family therapy (FFT), or (c) service as usual (SAU) through the shelter. Findings showed that both home-based EBFT and office-based FFT significantly reduced alcohol and drug use compared with SAU at 15-month postbaseline. Measures of family and adolescent functioning improved over time in all groups. However, significant differences among the home- and office-based interventions were found for treatment engagement and moderators of outcome.

N2  - BACKGROUND: National estimates of injury prevalence in the Emergency Department (ED) are based on medical record review and vary considerably. By using a more robust approach to surveillance, we (1) determine the prevalence of injury of any type in an urban ED population and (2) explore the association between violence-related injury and personal characteristics of injury victims., METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed at an urban level I trauma center from June to August, 2005. We prospectively screened 4,246 consecutive ED patients for injury during a randomized schedule of shifts totaling 336 hours. The ED record of each injured patient was reviewed to catalogue injury type and intent (International Classification of External Causes of Injury, Short Form) as well as to estimate injury severity (New Injury Severity Score). We interviewed noncritically injured, adult patients who provided consent to collect demographic (race, income, and education) and personal information (substance abuse, domestic violence, handgun ownership, and homelessness). We sought independent associations between these variables and violence-related injury in an exploratory analysis using multivariate logistic regression., RESULTS: Injury contributed to 1,036 of 4,246 ED visits (24.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 23.1-25.7%). Eleven percent of injured patients were admitted to the hospital and two patients died in the ED. The majority of patients (75%) suffered minor injury. Among the 434 injured patients consenting to interview, the prevalence of established injury risk factors, such as substance use or handgun ownership, varied by gender. The adjusted odds of violence-related injury among this subset of patients were increased for males (odds ratio [OR], 2.22; 95% CI, 1.17-4.23), patients with an annual income less than $5,000 (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.64-4.97), those reporting a history of domestic violence (OR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.43-5.07), and heavy alcohol users (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.01-3.19)., CONCLUSION: One in four ED visits to this urban, county hospital is due, at least in part, to injury. Patient characteristics associated with violence-related injury may generate hypotheses for further study.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To identify socio-demographic factors associated with household food insecurity in the Ontario population., METHODS: Using data from the Ontario Share File of the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 2.2, multivariate logistic regression was applied to identify the socio-demographic characteristics of households most likely to report food insecurity., RESULTS: Of the estimated 379,100 food-insecure households in Ontario in 2004, 55% were reliant on salaries or wages, 23% on social assistance, and 13% on pensions or seniors' benefits. The prevalence of food insecurity increased markedly as income adequacy declined, rising to 47% in the lowest category of income adequacy. Food insecurity was also more prevalent among tenant households and single-person and single-parent households. When all socio-demographic factors were taken into account, three potent socio-demographic correlates of household food insecurity in Ontario were identified: low income adequacy, social assistance as the main source of income, and not owning one's dwelling. Compared to households whose main source of income was salary or wages, the adjusted odds of experiencing food insecurity was 3.69 (95% CI: 2.33, 5.84) for households reliant on social assistance, but 0.44 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.67) for those reliant on pensions or seniors' benefits., DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the need for more adequate social assistance benefit levels, but also point to the need for better income supports for low-waged workers in Ontario so that they have sufficient financial resources to purchase the food they need.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that socioeconomic deprivation is associated with increased hospitalization lengths of stay (LOS) and costs. Yet, the French DRG-based information system (PMSI) does not take deprived situations into account. Hence, we aimed at extracting routinely available variables measuring deprivation from the Hospital Information System and at assessing their association with severity of illness and hospital LOS., METHODS: We performed record linkage between the PMSI database concerning stays of patients aged more than 16years in the short-stay sector of Assistance publique-Hopitaux de Paris in 2007 and an administrative database which provided the following deprivation measures: recipients of Couverture Medicale Universelle (basic or complementary health insurances adapted for underprivileged French citizens) or Aide Medicale d'Etat (health and medical emergency insurances adapted for underprivileged non French citizens living in France) and homeless patients. We compared length of stays showing a deprivation measure to others after adjustment on morbidity, age and sex., RESULTS: Among 352,721 stays, the prevalence of the deprivation measures ranged from 0.71% for "homelessness" to 6.24% for complementary Couverture Medicale Universelle. Stays showing a deprivation measure had specific illnesses and had more frequently associated comorbidities or complications than others. After adjustment, deprivation measures were associated with significantly increased LOS (by 5% for Couverture Medicale Universelle to 48% for emergency Aide Medicale d'Etat., CONCLUSION: Routine extraction of deprivation measures from Hospital Information Systems is feasible. Age, sex and illness being equal, these deprivation measures were associated with more complicated cases and increased LOS. We recommend that case mix-based hospital prospective payment systems take socioeconomic deprivation into account.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to compare medication access problems among psychiatric patients in ten state Medicaid programs, assess adverse events associated with medication access problems, and determine whether prescription drug utilization management is associated with access problems and adverse events., METHODS: Psychiatrists from the American Medical Association's Masterfile were randomly selected (N=4,866). Sixty-two percent responded; 32% treated Medicaid patients and were randomly assigned a start day and time to report on two Medicaid patients (N=1,625 patients)., RESULTS: A medication access problem in the past year was reported for a mean+/-SE of 48.3%+/-2.0% of the patients, with a 37.6% absolute difference between states with the lowest and highest rates (p<.001). The most common access problems were not being able to access clinically indicated medication refills or new prescriptions because Medicaid would not cover or approve them (34.0%+/-1.9%), prescribing a medication not clinically preferred because clinically indicated or preferred medications were not covered or approved (29.4%+/-1.8%), and discontinuing medications as a result of prescription drug coverage or management issues (25.8%+/-1.6%). With patient case mix adjusted to control for sociodemographic and clinical confounders, patients with medication access problems had 3.6 times greater likelihood of adverse events (p<.001), including emergency visits, hospitalizations, homelessness, suicidal ideation or behavior, or incarceration. Also, all prescription drug management features were significantly associated with increased medication access problems and adverse events (p<.001). States with more access problems had significantly higher adverse event rates (p<.001)., CONCLUSIONS: These associations indicate that more effective Medicaid prescription drug management and financing practices are needed to promote medication continuity and improve treatment outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined mental health service utilization and costs associated with the California Assembly Bill 2034 housing-first program for homeless persons in San Diego County: Reaching Out and Engaging to Achieve Consumer Health (REACH)., METHODS: Encounter data were used to identify REACH clients and a control group that was matched by propensity score. Mental health services costs for case management, outpatient services, inpatient and emergency services, criminal justice system services, and total services were summarized for two-year periods before and after clients initiated REACH. Incremental costs of the program were calculated as the difference in cost among clients in the REACH group, from pre- to postintervention, less the difference in cost among those in the control group from pre- to postintervention., RESULTS: A total of 177 REACH clients and 161 clients in a control group matched by propensity score were identified. Among REACH participants, case management costs increased by $6,403 (p<.001) from pre- to postintervention, inpatient plus emergency services costs declined by $6,103 (p=.034), and costs for mental health services provided by the criminal justice system declined by $570 (p=.020) compared with the control group. The standardized difference-in-difference estimate of the total costs between REACH clients and the control group was not significant., CONCLUSIONS: Participation in REACH was associated with substantial increases in outpatient services as well as cost offsets in inpatient and emergency services and criminal justice system services. The net cost of services, $417 over two years, was substantially lower than the total cost of services ($20,241).

N2  - Longitudinal growth trajectories of reading and math achievement were studied in four primary school grade cohorts (GCs) of a large urban district to examine academic risk and resilience in homeless and highly mobile (H/HM) students. Initial achievement was assessed when student cohorts were in the second, third, fourth, and fifth grades, and again 12 and 18 months later. Achievement trajectories of H/HM students were compared to low-income but nonmobile students and all other tested students in the district, controlling for four well-established covariates of achievement: sex, ethnicity, attendance, and English language skills. Both disadvantaged groups showed markedly lower initial achievement than their more advantaged peers, and H/HM students manifested the greatest risk, consistent with an expected risk gradient. Moreover, in some GCs, both disadvantaged groups showed slower growth than their relatively advantaged peers. Closer examination of H/HM student trajectories in relation to national test norms revealed striking variability, including cases of academic resilience as well as problems. H/HM students may represent a major component of "achievement gaps" in urban districts, but these students also constitute a heterogeneous group of children likely to have markedly diverse educational needs. Efforts to close gaps or enhance achievement in H/HM children require more differentiated knowledge of vulnerability and protective processes that may shape individual development and achievement.

A1  - Beardslee, William R
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Most studies of self-regulation involving children have linked it to specific outcomes within a single domain of adaptive functioning. The authors examined the association of self-regulation with a range of indices of adaptive functioning among 155 youth ages 8-18 years from families with very low income. Controlling for other explanatory variables, self-regulation was strongly associated with various outcome measures in the areas of mental health, behavior, academic achievement, and social competence. The authors also contrasted youths relatively high and low in self-regulation (the top and bottom quartiles). Youths with good self-regulation had much better indices of adaptive functioning across measures of social competence, academic achievement, grades, problem behaviors, and depression and anxiety than their counterparts with more diminished self-regulatory capacities. In addition, youths with better self-regulation skills stated more adaptive responses both in terms of how they coped with past stressful live events and how they would deal with hypothetical stressors. This study indicates that self-regulation is robustly associated with a range of important indices of adaptive functioning across many domains. Findings are discussed in light of their implications for theory and intervention for children of diverse economic backgrounds.

N2  - Homeless adults are at high risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In addition to culturally sensitive programmes designed to enhance vaccination compliance, accelerated HBV vaccination (three doses over 21 days) have also been suggested to improve compliance among high-risk groups. In this paper, we examined predictors of completers of two of three doses of a HAV/HBV vaccine series, normally delivered over a 6-month period, to simulate compliance with an accelerated series, dosed over 4 weeks. A convenience sample of 865 homeless adults was randomized into a nurse case-managed approach (NCMIT) vs standard programmes with (SIT) and without tracking (SI). Each group was assessed for completion of two of the three dose HAV/HBV vaccine series as well as the full three dose vaccine series. Sixty-eight percent of the NCMIT participants completed the three dose vaccination series at 6 months compared to 61% of SIT participants and 54% of SI participants. Eighty-one percent of the NCMIT participants completed two of the vaccinations compared to 78% of SIT participants and 73% of SI participants. The NCMIT approach resulted in greater numbers of completers of two of three doses and of the full three dose vaccine series. Predictors of completers of two doses and the full three dose vaccine series are provided. A greater number of homeless persons completed two doses across the three groups compared to the three dose vaccine series. The use of nurse case-management and tracking, coupled with an accelerated HAV/HBV vaccination schedule, may optimize vaccination compliance in homeless adults.

N2  - Research to date has given little attention to differences in the experience of youth homelessness by ethnicity. This article provides a comparative descriptive analysis of the effect of differences and similarities in paths to homelessness, self-perception, and survival strategies on health behaviors and consequent health outcomes of African American and white homeless youth in San Francisco, USA. We conducted participant observation and ethnographic interviews with 54 youth primarily recruited from street venues. Hypotheses generated from the ethnographic data were validated in between-group analyses using concurrent epidemiological data collected from a sample of 205 youth. Our samples of unstably housed African American and white youth, though sharing common histories of family dysfunction, differed in both the ethnographic accounts and epidemiological analyses in their experiences of family, access to housing, street survival strategies, self-presentation, health behaviors and service utilization. Our sample of white youth generally identified with the term "homeless," engaged in survival activities associated with such a label, and accessed the services intended to address the needs of homeless youth. In contrast, our sample of African American youth generally did not perceive themselves as "homeless," a stigmatized term, and were thus less likely to utilize, or be accessed by, relevant services.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among street-involved youth greatly exceed that of the general adolescent population; however, little is known regarding the structural factors that influence disease transmission risk among this population., METHODS: Between September 2005 and October 2006, 529 street-involved youth were enroled in a prospective cohort known as the At Risk Youth Study (ARYS). We examined structural factors associated with number of sex partners using quasi-Poisson regression and consistent condom use using logistic regression., RESULTS: At baseline, 415 (78.4%) were sexually active, of whom 253 (61.0%) reported multiple sex partners and 288 (69.4%) reported inconsistent condom use in the past six months. In multivariate analysis, self-reported barriers to health services were inversely associated with consistent condom use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.52, 95%CI: 0.25 - 1.07). Structural factors that were associated with greater numbers of sex partners included homelessness (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 1.54, 95%CI: 1.11 - 2.14) and having an area restriction that affects access to services (aIRR = 2.32, 95%CI: 1.28 - 4.18). Being searched or detained by the police was significant for males (aIRR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.02 - 1.81)., CONCLUSION: Although limited by its cross-sectional design, our study found several structural factors amenable to policy-level interventions independently associated with sexual risk behaviours. These findings imply that the criminalization and displacement of street-involved youth may increase the likelihood that youth will engage in sexual risk behaviours and exacerbate the negative impact of resultant health outcomes. Moreover, our findings indicate that environmental-structural interventions may help to reduce the burden of these diseases among street youth in urban settings.

N2  - PURPOSE: This exploratory study examined the feasibility of homeless parents' participation in an intervention to increase use of facilitating language strategies during interactions with their preschool children while residing in family homeless shelters. This study also examined the intervention's impact on the parents' use of facilitating language strategies, regardless of parent performance on a single-word receptive vocabulary test., METHOD: Using a prospective, pretest/posttest comparison group design, 12 parents were randomly assigned to a 4-session experimental group training emphasizing use of facilitating language utterances with children following vocabulary testing. Four parents were randomly assigned to a control group intervention., RESULTS: It was feasible for parents to participate in the intervention. Before the intervention, individual experimental group parents with poor test performance demonstrated relatively high use of facilitating language utterances. After the intervention, the experimental group increased use of facilitating language utterances during interactions with their children., CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study provides initial evidence that it is feasible for parents to participate in, and benefit from, a brief language-based group intervention while residing in family homeless shelters. Further study of language-based interventions for these at-risk families and of the possible impact of parent language functioning on intervention benefit is needed.

T1  - Comparisons of prevention programs for homeless youth.
A1  - Arnold, Elizabeth Mayfield

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - There are six HIV prevention programs for homeless youth whose efficacy has been or is currently being evaluated: STRIVE, the Community Reinforcement Approach, Strengths-Based Case Management, Ecologically-Based Family Therapy, Street Smart, and AESOP (street outreach access to resources). Programs vary in their underlying framework and theoretical models for understanding homelessness. All programs presume that the youths' families lack the ability to support their adolescent child. Some programs deemphasize family involvement while others focus on rebuilding connections among family members. The programs either normalize current family conflicts or, alternatively, provide education about the importance of parental monitoring. All programs aim to reduce HIV-related sexual and drug use acts. A coping skills approach is common across programs: Problem-solving skills are specifically addressed in four of the six programs; alternatively, parents in other programs are encouraged to contingently reward their children. Each program also engineers ongoing social support for the families and the youth, either by providing access to needed resources or by substituting a new, supportive relationship for the existing family caretaker. All of the interventions provide access to health and mental health services as basic program resources. A comparison of HIV prevention programs for homeless youth identifies the robust components of each and suggests which programs providers may choose to replicate.

N2  - AIMS: This study investigated a possible association between violence and the use of drugs, particularly methamphetamine and alcohol., METHODS: Cross-sectional, baseline data were derived from the At-Risk Youth Study, a prospective cohort of street-involved youth in Vancouver, Canada. Subjects were asked whether they had suffered or perpetrated violence in the 6 months prior to the interview., RESULTS: In total, 478 youth were enrolled, with a median age of 22 years (interquartile range = 20.0-23.9); 230 (48%) reported having been victims of violence, while 165 (34.5%) reported having perpetrated violence. Daily methamphetamine use was not associated with either outcome. In a multivariate analysis, daily alcohol consumption was significantly associated with being a victim (adjusted odds ratio = 2.10) and a perpetrator (adjusted odds ratio = 2.02) of violence. A history of abuse, failing a grade, and dealing drugs were also independently associated with violence, while having a regular partner was protective., CONCLUSION: Contrary to popular media reports that methamphetamine causes violence, we found no association. The association of alcohol with violence, though, has implications for screening and intervention programs. Copyright 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - This qualitative study used data from the Social Enterprise Intervention (SEI) pilot study, a comprehensive vocational training program with integrated clinical services for homeless youth. In-depth interviews were conducted with 28 homeless youth participating in the SEI study to explore their perceptions of family environment characteristics and abuse experiences. The constant comparative method was used to analyze transcripts from in-depth interviews with the youth participants. Emergent themes related to family characteristics include home instability, abandonment, and caregiver substance abuse. Abuse-related subthemes include intrafamilial abuse, caregiver abuse, rejection, and deprecation by caregivers. Grounded theory is used to interpret findings and develop working hypotheses to guide future studies of multitype maltreatment among homeless youth.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Alcohol screening and brief interventions in medical settings can significantly reduce alcohol use. Corresponding data for illicit drug use is sparse. A Federally funded screening, brief interventions, referral to treatment (SBIRT) service program, the largest of its kind to date, was initiated by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in a wide variety of medical settings. We compared illicit drug use at intake and 6 months after drug screening and interventions were administered., DESIGN: SBIRT services were implemented in a range of medical settings across six states. A diverse patient population (Alaska Natives, American Indians, African-Americans, Caucasians, Hispanics), was screened and offered score-based progressive levels of intervention (brief intervention, brief treatment, referral to specialty treatment). In this secondary analysis of the SBIRT service program, drug use data was compared at intake and at a 6-month follow-up, in a sample of a randomly selected population (10%) that screened positive at baseline., RESULTS: Of 459,599 patients screened, 22.7% screened positive for a spectrum of use (risky/problematic, abuse/addiction). The majority were recommended for a brief intervention (15.9%), with a smaller percentage recommended for brief treatment (3.2%) or referral to specialty treatment (3.7%). Among those reporting baseline illicit drug use, rates of drug use at 6-month follow-up (4 of 6 sites), were 67.7% lower (p<0.001) and heavy alcohol use was 38.6% lower (p<0.001), with comparable findings across sites, gender, race/ethnic, age subgroups. Among persons recommended for brief treatment or referral to specialty treatment, self-reported improvements in general health (p<0.001), mental health (p<0.001), employment (p<0.001), housing status (p<0.001), and criminal behavior (p<0.001) were found., CONCLUSIONS: SBIRT was feasible to implement and the self-reported patient status at 6 months indicated significant improvements over baseline, for illicit drug use and heavy alcohol use, with functional domains improved, across a range of health care settings and a range of patients.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We examined the efficacy of the Healthy Living Program in reducing risky sexual behavior and substance use among adults with HIV infection who were marginally housed (i.e., homeless at some point over a 37-month period)., METHODS: We had previously conducted a randomized controlled trial with 936 adults living with HIV infection. In that study, 3 intervention modules of 5 sessions each addressed different goals: reducing risky sexual acts and drug use, improving the quality of life, and adhering to healthful behaviors. Participants were interviewed at baseline and at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 months; 746 completed 4 or more assessments. In this study, we analyzed sexual behavior and drug use outcomes for the 35% (n = 270 of 767) of participants who were considered marginally housed., RESULTS: Among the marginally housed participants, there were significantly greater reductions in unprotected risky sexual acts, the number of sexual partners of HIV negative or unknown serostatus, alcohol or marijuana use, and hard drug use among the intervention group than among the control group., CONCLUSIONS: Intensive, skill-focused intervention programs may improve the lives of marginally housed adults living with HIV infection.

N2  - HIV-related stigma negatively affects the lives of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Homeless/unstably housed PLWHA experience myriad challenges and may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of HIV-related stigma. Homeless/unstably housed PLWHA from 3 U.S. cities (N = 637) completed computer-assisted interviews that measured demographics, self-assessed physical and mental health, medical utilization, adherence, HIV disclosure, and risk behaviors. Internal and perceived external HIV stigma were assessed and combined for a total stigma score. Higher levels of stigma were experienced by women, homeless participants, those with a high school education or less, and those more recently diagnosed with HIV. Stigma was strongly associated with poorer self-assessed physical and mental health, and perceived external stigma was associated with recent non-adherence to HIV treatment. Perceived external stigma was associated with decreased HIV disclosure to social network members, and internal stigma was associated with drug use and non-disclosure to sex partners. Interventions are needed to reduce HIV-related stigma and its effects on the health of homeless/unstably housed PLWHA.

N2  - The current study examined differences between gang-involved and non-gang-involved homeless African American male youth with regard to negative affect, substance use, and antisocial/violent behavior. A total of 69 homeless African American young men were recruited from community agencies and completed structured face-to-face interviews. Overall, gang members reported higher rates of negative mental and physical health outcomes than did non-gang members, with current gang members reporting higher levels of depression and anxiety, greater levels of antisocial and violent behavior, and higher levels of lifetime alcohol and marijuana use. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that greater levels of gang involvement were associated with more frequent lifetime use of alcohol and marijuana and higher levels of participation in violent behaviors. Implications of these findings for interventions with homeless African American male youth and future research directions are discussed.

T1  - A comparison of adolescent methamphetamine and other substance users in Hawai'i.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Methamphetamine use continues to be a significant problem for adolescents in Hawai'i, especially among Native Hawaiians and other Asian and Pacific Islanders. However, no research has compared the unique characteristics of these methamphetamine (MA) users to other substance users, which could contribute to enhanced treatment approaches. Utilizing a sample of adolescent treatment clients, this study compared those who have ever used and those who have never used methamphetamines on various domains. Results showed that girls were significantly more likely to use methamphetamines than other substances. Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders were more likely to use methamphetamines as well, although the difference was not statistically significant. MA users reported significantly more homelessness and prior treatment episodes. While no differences were found in arrest rates or days in jail/prison/juvenile detention in the past 90 days, MA users scored significantly higher on all self-reported crime indices. MA users also scored significantly higher on all substance problem and mental health indices, and reported significantly poorer health. Implications for future research and treatment are discussed.

T1  - Facilitating risk reduction among homeless and street-involved youth.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - PURPOSE: The purposes of this evaluation project were to describe a group of homeless adolescents and street-involved youth who utilized a mobile unit that provided medical and mental healthcare services and to assess the efficacy of the services provided in reducing their health risk behaviors., DATA SOURCES: The records of 95 youth aged 15-25 years who used the medical mobile unit for an average of 14 months were examined and evaluated according to the national health indicators related to risk reduction. Current literature related to health risk behavior among homeless youth was reviewed, synthesized, and provided the background for this article., CONCLUSIONS: Data were obtained from the records of mostly heterosexual youth with a mean age of 20.5 years. Approximately one third of the participants were high school graduates and most were without health insurance. Living situations were transient including friends, shelters, crash pads, or the streets. Abuse accounted for the majority leaving home. Psychiatric conditions and substance abuse were common. Medical conditions were related to transient living situations, substance abuse, and sexual activity. Success of the program was associated with sustained counseling, stabilizing youth on psychotropic medications, decreasing substance use, providing birth control and immunizations, and treating medical conditions., IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Homeless youth are one of the most underserved vulnerable populations in the United States with limited access and utilization of appropriate healthcare services. Nurse practitioners often serve as care providers but are also in a position to effectively lobby to improve health care for homeless youth through professional organizations and community activism. Furthermore, when designing and evaluating healthcare services, multidisciplinary teams need to consider risk reduction for homeless youth in the context of their environment.

N2  - Homeless adolescents who used alcohol or illicit substances but were not seeking treatment (n = 54) were recorded during brief motivational interventions. Adolescent language during sessions was coded on the basis of motivational interviewing concepts (global ratings of engagement and affect, counts of commitment to change, statements about reasons for change, and statements about desire or ability to change), and ratings were tested as predictors of rates of substance use over time. Results indicate that statements about desire or ability against change, although infrequent (M = 0.61 per 5 min), were strongly and negatively predictive of changes in substance use rates (days of abstinence over the prior month) at both 1- and 3-month postbaseline assessment (ps < .001). Statements about reasons for change were associated with greater reductions in days of substance use at 1-month assessment (p < .05). Commitment language was not associated with outcomes. Results suggest that specific aspects of adolescent speech in brief interventions may be important in the prediction of change in substance use. These relationships should be examined within larger samples and other clinical contexts. Copyright 2008 APA, all rights reserved

N2  - The Texas Christian University-Treatment Motivation Assessment (TCU-TMA) was originally developed to assess motivation among in-treatment opiod users. Numerous studies of in-treatment substance abusers in a variety of settings have confirmed the three factors present in the scale, including Problem Recognition, Desire For Help, and Treatment Readiness. The goal of the present study was to examine the factor structure of the TCU-TMA in a sample of 367 pretreatment substance abusers assessed at a centralized intake unit who had not yet entered treatment. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses led to the development of the Pretreatment Readiness Scale (PRS) that, like the TCU-TMA, contained Problem Recognition and Treatment Readiness factors. Desire for Change replaced Desire for Help in the new scale and Treatment Reluctance indicated mixed feelings about entering treatment. The implications of these findings on developing interventions for the pretreatment group will be discussed.

T1  - A comparison of risk factors for sexual victimization among gay, lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual homeless young adults.
A1  - Tyler, Kimberly A
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Although high rates of sexual victimization have been reported among homeless youth, less is known about whether the risk factors vary for gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth compared to heterosexual youth. Based on a sample of 172 homeless young adults ages 19 to 26, results revealed that depressive symptoms, prostitution, and having friends who traded sex were significantly associated with higher levels of sexual victimization. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual young adults experienced more sexual victimization compared to heterosexual young adults. A test for interactions revealed that the effect of sexual orientation on sexual victimization was moderated by trading sex and having friends who traded sex. Finally, there is support for partial mediation of the effects of sexual abuse, neglect, and depressive symptoms on sexual victimization through other risk factors.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Although soft tissue infections are common among injection drug users (IDUs), little is known about the health outcomes among those who seek care for these infections. Emergency department visits are an important point-of-health-care contact for IDUs. In this prospective cohort study, we aimed to determine the hospitalization and mortality rates and factors associated with hospitalization or death among IDUs seeking emergency care for soft tissue infection., METHOD: Participants were English-speaking IDUs, 18 years of age and older, who sought initial care for soft tissue infection in an urban emergency department. We conducted semistructured interviews, identified hospitalizations from hospital records, and identified deaths using the National Death Index. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to investigate associations between baseline characteristics and hospitalizations or death., RESULTS: Of 211 eligible patients, 156 (74%) participated (mean age = 42 years). There were 255 subsequent hospitalizations over a mean of 3.9 years follow-up. The hospitalization rate was 42 hospitalizations per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38-48). The mortality rate was 2.0 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 1.1-3.7). Factors associated with increased risk for hospitalization or death included living on the street or in a shelter (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.10-2.79), being recently incarcerated (AOR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.05-3.44), and having insurance (AOR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.22-3.23)., CONCLUSIONS: IDUs who sought care in the emergency department for soft tissue infections were at high risk for subsequent hospitalization and death. Visits for soft tissue infections represent missed opportunities for preventive care.

T1  - Violence in street culture: cross-cultural comparison of youth groups and criminal gangs.
A1  - Zdun, Steffen
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Violence is a widespread phenomenon in juvenile street culture. But the questions of whether this relationship is a deterministic one, and if not, which are the contributing factors, are largely unanswered. This article focuses on the role of public space, starting with a comparison of the meaning of deviant behavior and crime in street culture in Brazil, Russia, and Germany. Focusing on street culture norms and their relevance for youth groups in everyday life, the author shows that there are worldwide similarities, and these are most likely to be seen in disadvantaged neighborhoods. The article deals not only with the question of how people act in conflicts but also focuses on a social order in which the reputation of men is based mainly on questions of masculinity, honor, and power expressed through aggressive behavior. The results are based on more than one hundred semistructured qualitative interviews with street culture youth, prison inmates, adult family members, social workers, police, and researchers that were conducted in recent years in the three countries. The study also describes a typology of conflict behavior among male street culture youth that helps in understanding why even juveniles who were socialized in the milieu of the street culture can reject violence and do not have to turn to violence in all conflicts. The article examines the similarities in the reasons for violence and fear of violence, as well as the differences in frequency and intensity between violent countries (such as Brazil and the Russian Federation) and less violent countries (for example, Germany).

T1  - Effectiveness of a peer-support community in addiction recovery: participation as intervention.

A1  - Clarie, Anna June
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - The main purpose of the study was to determine whether a peer-support community programme would reduce relapse rates among clients recovering from substance addictions and homelessness and result in increased perceived community affiliation, supportive behaviours, self-determination and quality of life. Mixed methods were utilized including semi-structured interviews, participant observation and a pretest/post-test to evaluate changes on the quality of life rating, the Medical Outcomes Study-Social Support Survey, and the Volitional Questionnaire. Data from the prior year's permanent supportive housing programme were used for comparison of relapse rates. Significant reduction of risk of relapse was found in clients who participated in the programme. Significant differences were found on three subscales of the Medical Outcomes Study-Social Support Survey. Improvement that did not reach statistical significance was seen on the quality of life rating. Qualitative evidence supported improvements in perceived community affiliation and supportive behaviours.Evidence suggests that a peer-supported community programme focused on self-determination can have a significant positive impact on recovery from substance addictions and homelessness. Limitations include a small sample size and lack of a randomized control group. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the lifetime prevalence of traumatic brain injury and its association with current health conditions in a representative sample of homeless people in Toronto, Ontario., METHODS: We surveyed 601 men and 303 women at homeless shelters and meal programs in 2004-2005 (response rate 76%). We defined traumatic brain injury as any self-reported head injury that left the person dazed, confused, disoriented or unconscious. Injuries resulting in unconsciousness lasting 30 minutes or longer were defined as moderate or severe. We assessed mental health, alcohol and drug problems in the past 30 days using the Addiction Severity Index. Physical and mental health status was assessed using the SF-12 health survey. We examined associations between traumatic brain injury and health conditions., RESULTS: The lifetime prevalence among homeless participants was 53% for any traumatic brain injury and 12% for moderate or severe traumatic brain injury. For 70% of respondents, their first traumatic brain injury occurred before the onset of homelessness. After adjustment for demographic characteristics and lifetime duration of homelessness, a history of moderate or severe traumatic brain injury was associated with significantly increased likelihood of seizures (odds ratio [OR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8 to 5.6), mental health problems (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.5 to 4.1), drug problems (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.5), poorer physical health status (-8.3 points, 95% CI -11.1 to -5.5) and poorer mental health status (-6.0 points, 95% CI -8.3 to -3.7)., INTERPRETATION: Prior traumatic brain injury is very common among homeless people and is associated with poorer health.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: In this we study explored the relationship between food insecurity and compensatory maternal feeding practices that may be perceived as buffers against periodic food shortages among urban black families., METHODS: We interviewed a convenience sample of black mothers of children aged 2 to 13 years. Food-security status (predictor) was determined at the household level. Five maternal feeding practices (outcomes) were assessed. Two were based on Birch's Child Feeding Questionnaire (restricting access to certain foods and pressuring a child to eat), and 3 were derived from investigators' clinical experience (use of high-energy supplements, added sugar in beverages, and perceived appetite stimulants). Anthropometric data were collected from mothers and children., RESULTS: A total of 278 mother-child dyads were analyzed, and 28% of these mothers reported being food insecure. Use of Child Feeding Questionnaire feeding practices was defined as the top quartile of responses. Use of nutritional supplements, defined as "at least 1 to 2 times monthly," ranged from 13% to 25%. In logistic regression models adjusted for child age, weight status, and ethnicity and maternal weight status, mothers from food-insecure households were significantly more likely to use high-energy supplements and appetite stimulants. The odds of using the remaining compensatory feeding practices (adding sugars to beverages, pressuring a child to eat, and restricting access to certain foods) were elevated among food-insecure households but did not reach statistical significance., CONCLUSIONS: Household food insecurity was independently associated with 2 of the 5 maternal compensatory feeding practices studied, and such practices may alter the feeding environment. Longitudinal research is necessary to determine how the relationship between food security and compensatory maternal feeding practices may affect child weight trajectories.

N2  - Case histories of 147 patients with new-onset destructive pulmonary tuberculosis (PT) (infiltrative, disseminated, fibrocavernous) with the pathogen of the disease showing multidrug resistance (MDR) were analyzed, by evaluating the efficiency of treatment involving sputum abacillation after termination of the inpatient stage of treatment. A control group included 220 patients with PT of the similar lesion and clinical forms, who preserved drug resistance (DR) to antibacterial agents. Most patients with MDR disseminated destructive PT are young people aged 36.6 +/- 1.6 years, this disease-associated disabled individuals (65.3%), alcoholics (48.3%), opium addicts (11.5%), ex-prisoners (26.5%), single, homeless; more frequently suffer from gastrointestinal (40%) and chronic nonspecific lung (24.5%) diseases. The course of MDR PT is significantly more commonly complicated by the development of respiratory failure (48.9%) and hemoptysis (6.1%) (in DR PT 19.1 and 2.3%, respectively). In terms of negative smear tests and the results of sputum cultures, the abacillation rates were 70.1 and 67.3%, respectively (in DR PT, these were 88.18 and 86.34%, p = 0.01). A negative reaction of sputum occurred in 42.1% of patients at 2-3 months of treatment while its culture did in 46.2% at 4-5 months. In the control group wherein drug sensitivity of M. tuberculosis was preserved, sputum abacillation occurred in the larger proportion of the patients within the first 2 months (in 68.6 and 56.3% of cases with sputum smear and culture, respectively). The efficiency of inpatient therapy is greatly affected by short-term treatment caused by voluntary withdrawal and irregular uses of antituberculous drugs, mainly due to alcoholization.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Finding direct and indirect influences of salient psychosocial and situational variables on problem substance use among homeless people is important in designing evidence-based, effective, and relevant interventions for this special population. A stress-coping paradigm in conjunction with situational items specialized for homeless people was used to explore predictive relationships in a sample of homeless adults (N = 664) among (a) psychosocial variables of self-esteem, social support, positive and negative coping, and emotional distress, (b) situational variables of homelessness history and quality of recent housing, and (c) outcomes of alcohol use, injection drug use (IDU), and non-IDU. Lower self-esteem predicted greater emotional distress, lower positive coping, greater negative coping, and more alcohol use. Social support predicted less emotional distress and more positive coping. Chronic homelessness predicted more emotional distress, less positive coping, greater alcohol use, and IDU. Poor housing was associated with more alcohol use and IDU. Substance abuse interventions among the homeless should have a dual focus that includes attention to psychological issues and negative coping patterns while also addressing situational, environmental factors, including encouraging provision of permanent supportive housing.

N2  - Shelter data in a recent study revealed discharges from psychiatric facilities to shelters or the street occurred at least 194 times in 2002 in London, Ontario, Canada. This problem must be addressed to reduce the disastrous effects of such discharge, including re-hospitalization and prolonged homelessness. An intervention was developed and tested to prevent homelessness associated with discharge directly to no fixed address. A total of 14 participants at-risk of being discharged without housing were enrolled, with half randomized into the intervention group. The intervention group was provided with immediate assistance in accessing housing and assistance in paying their first and last month's rent. The control group received usual care. Data was collected from participants prior to discharge, at 31 and 6-months post-discharge. All the individuals in the intervention group maintained housing after 3 and 6 months. All but one individual in the control group remained homeless after 3 and 6 months. The exception joined the sex trade to avoid homelessness. The results of this pilot were so dramatic that randomizing to the control group was discontinued. Discussions are underway to routinely implement the intervention. Systemic improvements can prevent homelessness for individuals being discharged from psychiatric wards.

N2  - PURPOSE: To examine the effect of time spent homeless on young people's substance use and use of drug and alcohol services in two countries with contrasting policy and service environments., METHODS: A crossnational survey was conducted of recently homeless and experienced homeless young people in Melbourne (N = 674) and Los Angeles (N = 620). Questions were asked about alcohol and drug use in the past 3 months, frequency of use, injecting drug use, drug dependency, and perceived need for, and use of, drug and alcohol services. Data were analyzed using logistic regression., RESULTS: Substantial numbers of young people reported use of alcohol and drugs. More Australians than Americans and more experienced than newly homeless reported drug use, although there were no differences in frequency of use in the past 3 months. Polydrug use was common, as were injecting drugs and responses that signified drug dependency. All were more common among Australians and experienced homeless young people. A substantial number of young people had "ever" taken part in a drug or alcohol program, but only a minority believed that they needed help from services. Of these, only a minority had sought help. This was particularly so among those who were classified as drug dependent. Reasons for failure to seek help varied., CONCLUSION: Substance use is alarmingly high compared to national samples of young people, especially among those who had been homeless for longer periods. Programs to reduce substance use must take account of the prevailing drug cultures, as well as different subgroups of the population.

N2  - Among persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) experiencing homelessness or imminent risk of homelessness, a history of incarceration may serve as a marker for ongoing risk behavior or health disparities. We examined factors associated with a history of incarceration among HIV-positive clients of housing agencies in Baltimore, Chicago, and Los Angeles (N = 581). We used logistic regression to conduct analyses. Of the 581 participants, 68% (n = 438) reported a history of incarceration: 32% (n = 182) had spent more than 1 year incarcerated. After adjustment for covariates, incarceration history was associated with having ever injected drugs, ever engaged in sex exchange, and ever experienced physical abuse. Incarceration history was also associated with having a detectable HIV viral load, better mental health, and being a biological parent. It was not associated with current risk behavior. Service providers may explore possible increased need for medical support among homeless PLWHA with a history of incarceration.

N2  - This study evaluated the effectiveness of the three approaches for treating dual disorder clients who were homeless at intake: integrated assertive community treatment (IACT), assertive community treatment only (ACTO), and standard care (SC). Multilevel Random Coefficient Modeling (MRCM) was used to analyze longitudinal effects and to identify mediators of significant treatment effects. The outcome variables were consumer satisfaction, stable housing, psychiatric symptoms, and substance abuse. The eight mediators were service utilization variables: program contacts, phone contacts, substance abuse contacts, assistance with activities of daily living, transportation assistance, help finding permanent housing, help with emotional problems, and medication assistance. The 191 eligible participants were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions and followed for a period of 30 months. Both ACTO and IACT produced better outcomes than SC on consumer satisfaction and stable housing. There were no differences on any of the outcome variables between ACTO versus IACT when comparing main effects. However, there were several treatment by time interactions. In addition, there were many mediation effects.

N2  - In order to assess the extent of xylazine (Xyz) injection in Puerto Rico, two waves of used-syringe collections were performed. In the first, syringes were gathered, anonymously and without additional information; in the second, a short interview, also anonymous, was administered. We found Xyz in 37.6% of the collected syringes; the majority of the Xyz-containing syringes came from ranching communities. Syringes containing Xyz more frequently also contained "speedball" than those without (90.6% and 66.7%, respectively). Self-reports of Xyz injection deviated markedly from actual detection: only 50% (self-described users) and 22% (self-described non-users) of the collected syringes contained the drug. With a high prevalence of skin ulcers (38.5% vs. 6.8%; p<0.001), Xyz users were more likely to be in poor health compared to non-users. Surprisingly, though a higher percentage of Xyz users than non-users had college-level educations (23.1% vs. 5.5%), they were more likely to be homeless (64.1% vs. 37%).

N2  - Increasing numbers of youth are presenting for psychiatric evaluation with markedly irritable mood plus "hyperarousal" symptoms. Diagnostically homeless in current nosology, the syndrome (as well as its underlying neurobiology) is little understood. To address this problem, we conducted an exploratory proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) study in a large sample of youth with chronic, functionally disabling irritability accompanied by hyperarousal, a clinical syndrome known as "severe mood dysregulation" (SMD), which may represent a broad phenotype of pediatric bipolar disorder. Medication-free SMD youth (N=36) and controls (N=48) underwent 1.5 Tesla MRS in four regions of interest. The following three neurometabolites, relative to creatine (Cr), were quantified with LCModel Software: (a) myo-inositol (mI), a marker of intra-cellular second messengers linked to the neurobiology of bipolar disorder; (b) glutamate/glutamine (GLX), a marker of the major excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate; and (c) N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), a marker of neuronal energetics. SMD subjects had significantly lower temporal mI/Cr versus controls. However, this difference did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Given studies implicating mI in lithium's action in BD adults and youth, further work is necessary to determine potential therapeutic implications of our present finding and how SMD youth differ pathophysiologically from those with strictly defined BD.

T1  - Lowering the premature birth rate: what the U.S. experience means for Japan.
A1  - Noguchi, Akihiko
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Premature birth rate and low birth weight rate are increasing in industrialized countries including USA and Japan. The Infant mortality rate (IMR) is three times and 50-75 times greater for infants born at 32-36 weeks and <32 weeks respectively than term-born counterparts. In the U.S., the IMR is greater than in Japan particularly among black infants and simply the "lower socioeconomic class" is not the answer. Premature birth is heterogeneous in origin and idiopathic in 70% of the cases. Increased utilization of assisted reproductive technology only accounts for a part of the recent trend. Evidence suggests environmental factors play a significant role, and genetic-environmental interaction is plausible. A chronic psychosocial stress of pregnant women has been postulated to be modifying the endocrine milieu thereby influencing pregnancy outcomes. In a preliminary observation in St. Louis, homeless pregnant women with high behavioral and social risks, when accommodated in a shelter home designed for these women, produced significantly less numbers of premature and low birth weight infants as compared with the general population. Furthermore, in a randomized controlled study in Washington DC, psychobehavioral intervention specifically targeting smoking (primary and secondary), intimate partner violence (IPV), and depression among black pregnant women significantly decreased the rate of miscarriage and low birth weight. These reports may have significant implication to the Japanese situation. Increasing number of Japanese women at reproductive age are exposed to smoking, may have underling psychosocial stress and may suffer from subclinical depression and/or from IPV. Detailed epidemiological studies of women before and during the reproductive age with regard to risk factors can lead to an effective intervention strategy against premature birth in Japan.

N2  - The AIDS epidemic has contributed to a drastic increase in the number of orphans in Zimbabwe. Orphans (whether orphaned by AIDS or other causes) have been shown to have economic and educational disadvantages as well as poor reproductive health outcomes. We recruited a convenience sample of 200 girls in a peri-urban area of Zimbabwe to examine the impact of orphan status (compared to non-orphans) on household composition, education, risk behaviour, pregnancy and prevalent HIV and HSV-2 infection. In our population, maternal orphans were more likely to be in households headed by themselves or a sibling, to be sexually active, to have had an STI, to have been pregnant and to be infected with HIV. Paternal orphans were more likely to have ever been homeless and to be out of school. Our findings suggest that maternal care and support is important for HIV prevention. This finding corroborates previous research in Zimbabwe and has implications for intervention strategies among orphan girls.

N2  - The repeatability of a telephone questionnaire on cat-ownership patterns, demographics and attitudes towards homeless cats in a community was evaluated. Randomly selected households (n=100) within Caldwell, Texas, were included in the study. The response percentage was 84% (100/119) among those contacted and 75% (100/134) among all eligible respondents. Repeatability was measured by administering the same survey twice to the first 100 responding subjects, with an average (range) of 48 (25-64) days between interviews. The survey was initially administered from 6 June to 28 June 2005 and the follow-up survey was administered from 19 July to 11 August 2005. Repeatability for most cat-ownership characteristics was fair to good between the two interviews (kappa 0.47-0.82). Knowledge of companion animals and subject attachment to pet questions had good correlations between the two interviews (rsp 0.52 and 0.60, respectively). Subject-demographic questions had excellent repeatability (kappa 0.66-1.00).

N2  - Homeless youth are at increased risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and HBV vaccine coverage is poor in this group. The purpose of our study was to determine if a shelter-based HBV vaccine program in children and adolescents 2-18 years of age with a randomized controlled trial using a culturally appropriate HBV video could increase HBV vaccine coverage rates. Subjects were randomized to an 8 min HBV video or a control, smoking prevention video. Before exposure to the videos, HBV knowledge, and demographics were assessed in caregivers and adolescents. HBV vaccine no. 1 was offered to all subjects who did not produce a vaccine record; subsequently, an accurate HBV vaccine history was obtained from medical providers. Subjects were asked to return 1 and 3 months after visit 1, HBV vaccine was offered to all with incomplete coverage, and HBV knowledge was reassessed. There were 328 children and adolescents cared for by 170 caregivers enrolled in the study. One hundred and four had incomplete HBV vaccine coverage. Data are reported for all family units with at least one subject needing vaccine. There were 53 children and adolescents randomized to the HBV video vs. 51 to the smoking video. HBV knowledge scores of caregivers improved at Visit no. 2 vs. no. 1 in the HBV video group (p = 0.01) but not in the smoking group (p = 0.82). Similar results were observed for adolescents in the HBV video group (p = 0.05) but not in the smoking group (p = 0.40). Exposure to the HBV video vs the smoking video had a significant effect on return rates for vaccine at Visit no. 2 (59 vs. 31%; p = 0.05) but not at Visit no. 3 (47 vs. 18%, p = 0.06). The shelter-based vaccine program was very effective in increasing HBV coverage rates in the entire group of 328 children and adolescents enrolled in the study, from 68% coverage at baseline to 85% at the conclusion of the study. We conclude that shelter-based HBV vaccine programs can be highly effective in increasing vaccine coverage rates in older children and adolescents. A brief exposure to a culturally appropriate HBV video improves HBV knowledge and may improve return rates for vaccine.

T1  - Effects of housing circumstances on health, quality of life and healthcare use for people with severe mental illness: a review.
A1  - Kyle, Tania
A1  - Dunn, James R
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Individuals with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) identify housing as an important factor in achieving and maintaining their health. However, many live in substandard accommodations that are physically inadequate, crowded, noisy and located in undesirable neighbourhoods. In much of the research on housing for persons with SPMI, the central outcome of interest is remaining housed; however, it is worth investigating whether housing has other benefits. This paper is a systematic review of studies that investigated the relationship between housing-related independent variables and health-related dependent variables. Ten online databases were searched for studies published since 1980 that had study populations of adults with SPMI, analysed primary or secondary empirical data, and measured housing-related independent variables and health-related dependent variables. Clearly defined epidemiological criteria were used to assess the strength of evidence of the selected studies. Twenty-nine studies met the suitability criteria, of which 14 reported healthcare utilisation outcomes; 12 examined mental status outcomes; and 9 reported quality-of-life outcomes. The findings of the review suggest that there is good evidence that housing interventions benefit the homeless population; however more research is needed about housing solutions for individuals with SPMI who are housed, but in precarious or inappropriate housing situations. Study methodologies could be improved by emphasising longitudinal designs that focus on participant retention and by implementing matched control groups or randomised interventions to strengthen internal validity. Ensuring that a person is adequately housed upon discharge from hospital should be a treatment priority. When housing eligibility is not dependent on psychiatric treatment compliance and sobriety, providing permanent housing minimises harm and may free people to voluntarily seek treatment. Housing that offers an unlimited length of stay is recommended because SPMI is a chronic and fluctuating condition that requires stable surroundings to maintain health.

N2  - The Minnesota Wheel of Public Health Nursing Interventions identifies coalition building and community organizing as effective strategies for addressing population health issues. One program that exemplifies these strategies is the Hmong Youth Task Force, a coalition formed to address a growing issue of young Hmong girls in a Midwest state running away from home, being truant from school, and experiencing subsequent sexual exploitation. This is an evaluation of the Task Force. It draws on existing records and semi-structured interviews with Task Force members from various sectors of government, health services, and community organizations, including public health nurses. The results, evaluated in the context of best practices identified by the Wheel of Interventions, document the Task Force's development, accomplishments, challenges faced, and community changes that have resulted from the coalition's efforts to date.

T1  - Nursing care management at a shelter-based clinic: an innovative model for care.
A1  - D'Amico, Jessica B

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: (1) Describe the nurse care manager role at a shelter-based clinic for women and children who have experienced domestic violence (DV). (2) Develop an innovative model for nursing care management in this unique setting and discuss implications for its implementation in other shelter-based clinics. (3) Provide historical benchmarking data on the use of health-related community resources and common barriers to obtaining these services among women and children following a nurse care management intervention., PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING: A clinic-based, nurse care management model was developed and implemented at a not-for-profit emergency residential shelter for women and children who have experienced DV. However, DV victims do not just appear in the community: nurse case managers encounter DV in every healthcare setting from hospitals to physician offices/clinics., FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: A shelter-based clinic is a safe, confidential, and easily accessible place for women and children victimized by DV to receive immediate care and ongoing assistance for health-related needs. The nurse care manager, who practices in this setting and utilizes motivational interviewing techniques, has a unique opportunity to empower and support women to make informed decisions regarding the health and well-being of themselves and their children., IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: Provision of nursing care management services in a shelter-based clinic is an innovative approach to improving outcomes and reducing the burden of suffering among women and children who leave abusive situations. The nurse care manager role and, specifically, the model of care described in this project, which includes motivational interviewing techniques, may be generalized to other shelter-type settings to promote sustained, healthy lifestyle practices for victims of DV. Benchmarks developed in this study serve as an initial approach to evaluating outcomes when applying this nursing care management model in practice. Future studies on the effectiveness of this approach among victims of DV are warranted.

N2  - Substance abuse is prevalent in adolescent street children, and death is reported as secondary to aspiration, accidental trauma, asphyxia, cardiac arrhythmia, anoxia, vagal inhibition and respiratory depression. In this study, we examined electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings from 53 street male adolescents, comparing our findings to those obtained from 61 controls in the same age group. The street children smoked cigarettes (98.1%) and had used, or were using, thinner (73.6%), glue (75.5%), hashish (79.2%), morphine or its products (24.5%), ecstasy (37.7%), anti-emetics (13.2%) and alcohol (60.4%). On examination, their blood pressures were lower than the control group. Electrocardiographically, PR, QRS, QT were found to be longer (p less than 0.05) than the values for healthy controls. Although it was not statistically significant, QTc duration was also longer than the control group. Echocardiography revealed increased diameters of the left ventricle and atrium, the aorta, and the coronary arteries as compared to the healthy children (p less than 0.05).

N2  - While many studies provide useful information on the risk behaviors in which homeless youth engage, few prior studies evaluate Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) risk related reduction strategies. In this study, homeless youth (n = 180) were recruited from a drop-in center and randomly assigned to one of two conditions, either an integrated individual cognitive-behavioral treatment and HIV prevention intervention that focused on skills building and education or to treatment as usual. All youth were assessed at entry into the program and at 3 and 6 month follow-up points. Findings showed an interaction between treatment condition, age and time. In the interaction, youth assigned to the integrated treatment reported greater condom usage than youth assigned to treatment as usual, with younger youth assigned to treatment as usual showing no change in condom use. The number of sexual partners reported by youth in both treatment conditions was also reduced over time. However, youth in both conditions continued to engage in other high-risk behaviors. The integrated treatment findings are promising and suggest that interventions which target both HIV risk behavior in addition to other life areas (substance use, mental health and housing) among homeless youth may be necessary in order to significantly impact high-risk behaviors among this unique group.

T1  - School absenteeism and school refusal behavior in youth: a contemporary review.
A1  - Kearney, Christopher A
Y1  - 2008//
Y2  - 20070803//
N2  - Absenteeism from school is a serious public health issue for mental health professionals, physicians, and educators. The prevalence of unexcused absences from school exceeds that of major childhood behavior disorders and is a key risk factor for violence, injury, substance use, psychiatric disorders, and economic deprivation. This article involves a contemporary research review on absenteeism prevalence, comorbid physical and psychiatric conditions, classification, contextual risk factors, cross-cultural variables, assessment, intervention, and outcome. Contextual risk factors include homelessness and poverty, teenage pregnancy, school violence and victimization, school climate and connectedness, parental involvement, and family variables, among others. A description of intervention includes medical, clinical, and systemic interventions. Medical professionals, community- and school-based mental health professionals, and educators are encouraged to fully understand the parameters of school absenteeism to develop better, consensual policies regarding definition, classification, assessment, and intervention of youths with problematic school absenteeism.

N2  - This study examined the association of homelessness and related factors with child psychiatric and behavior disorders (diagnosed with structured diagnostic interviews) and child cognitive ability (on the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test) in a randomly selected sample of 157 homeless children and their mothers and a comparison of 61 housed children and their mothers. Homeless children had more disruptive behavior disorders and lower cognitive scores than housed children. In multivariate analyses, maternal verbal scores and child nonverbal scores were associated with child verbal ability; maternal education, homelessness, and child nonverbal scores were related to child behavior disorders.

N2  - BACKGROUND: While older individuals who are homeless tend to be in poorer health, it is less clear how they view their health care needs and whether their self-reported patterns for accessing health services differ from younger homeless counterparts., METHODS: Cross-sectional, community-based survey of homeless adults in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia using face-to-face interviews from population proportionate sampling of sites and random sampling of subjects. Survey questions included physical and mental health comorbidities, self-reported health care, social services and personal needs, means of economic support, and sources for usual health care. For analysis purposes, respondents were grouped by age 18 to 49 years old and 50 years old or older., RESULTS: Overall, 531 adults were interviewed, with 74 respondents 50 years old or older (13.9%). Older homeless persons were 3.6 times more likely to report a chronic medical condition, 2.8 times more likely to have health insurance, and 2.4 times more likely to be dependent on heroin than homeless persons less than 50 years old. However, they also tended to use shelter-based clinics and street outreach teams more commonly as their source of usual care (20.9% vs 10.6%, P=.02) and were significantly less likely to report a need for substance abuse treatment despite high rates of abuse., CONCLUSION: Older homeless adults have a greater disease burden than their younger counterparts. However, it is unclear whether these needs are being appropriately identified and met. There is a need for specific and targeted outreach to connect them to appropriate services.

T1  - Comparison of a qualitative and a quantitative approach to developing a household food insecurity scale for Bangladesh.

N2  - This paper compares a qualitative and a quantitative (Rasch) method of item assessment for developing the content of a food insecurity scale for Bangladesh. Data are derived from the Bangladesh Food Insecurity Measurement and Validation Study, in which researchers collected 2 rounds of ethnographic information and 3 rounds of conventional household survey data between 2001 and 2003. The qualitative method of scale development relied on content experts and respondents themselves to evaluate household food insecurity items generated through ethnographic research. The quantitative method applied the Rasch model to assess the fit of the same items using representative survey data. The Rasch model was then used to test for differential item functioning (DIF) across diverse demographic and geographic subgroups. The qualitative assessment flagged and discarded 10 items, leaving 13. The Rasch assessment of infit and outfit flagged 3 items, and the Rasch DIF test discarded another 10 items, leaving a total of 10 items in the Rasch-derived scale. The 2 scales contained 8 of the same items. The qualitatively and quantitatively derived scales were highly correlated (r = 0.96, P < 0.01), and the 2 methods located 90% of households in the same food insecurity tercile. This convergence lends added confidence to the use of either scale for identifying food-insecure households in different regions of Bangladesh. Multiple methods should continue to be applied in a systematic and transparent way to lend additional credence to the results when they converge and to pinpoint directions for further clarification where they do not.

N2  - An environmental behavioural modification programme was implemented in Alexandria city, Egypt, in order to help street children to change their behaviour, discover their abilities and develop and acquire new skills and knowledge. The programme included camping and field trips, recreational activities and games, role play and theatre, story-telling, life-skill activities, and gardening and animal care. Data were collected from observational sheets of adaptive behaviour and conversation sessions before and after the intervention on a sample of 35 street children aged between 7 and 15 years. The mean scores for each behavioural item and all items together before and after the intervention were significantly improved in a number of areas, except for speech disorders and substance use.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases (STD) among homeless Muslim (circumcised) and Hindu (uncircumcised) men in Kolkata, India., BACKGROUND: Many observational studies and clinical trials in Africa have demonstrated that male circumcision provides protection against HIV acquisition, but there are sparse data on circumcision and HIV in India, which has the largest number of HIV cases in the world., METHODS: Using a two-stage probability proportionate to size cluster design among homeless men aged 18-49 years in Kolkata, India, data were obtained on religion, behavioral risk factors, and HIV/STD prevalence, by administering an anonymous questionnaire. Rapid HIV tests and testing for syphilis were performed on blood, and urine samples were obtained to test for gonorrhea., RESULTS: The odds ratio for HIV among Muslims (circumcised) compared to Hindus (uncircumcised) was 0.43 (95% confidence interval 0.29-0.67). Despite Muslims having more partners and visits to commercial sex workers, the rates of syphilis and gonorrhea were similar. The results suggest that a biological effect of circumcision protects against HIV infection., CONCLUSION: The beneficial effect of circumcision should be communicated to high-risk groups, as well as to the general population.

N2  - A brief motivational intervention with 117 homeless adolescents was evaluated using a randomized design and 3-month follow-up. The intervention was designed to raise youths' concerns about their substance use, support harm reduction, and encourage greater service utilization at a collaborating agency. The study was designed to strengthen initial promising results of an earlier study (P. L. Peterson, J. S. Baer, E. A. Wells, J. A. Ginzler, & S. B. Garrett, 2006). Several modifications in the clinical protocol were included to enhance engagement with the intervention. Analyses revealed no significant benefits for intervention participants when homeless youths' substance use rates were compared with those of control participants. Service utilization during the intervention period increased for those receiving the intervention but returned to baseline levels at follow-up. Participants reported overall reductions in substance use over time. Differences between sampling methods for the current and previous study are discussed, as are the limitations of brief interventions with this population. Future research needs to elucidate mechanisms of change and service engagement for highly vulnerable youth.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We compared health and social needs by gender, age, and race/ ethnicity of people leaving New York City jails and assessed the implication of these differences for the development of jail reentry programs., METHODS: Surveys were completed with 1,946 individuals (536 men, 704 women, and 706 adolescent males) between 1997 and 2004. Structured questionnaires captured data on demographic, criminal justice, substance use, and health characteristics. Bivariate comparisons were performed to determine variations between men and women, men and male adolescents, and non-Latino black and Hispanic/Latino respondents., RESULTS: The majority of participants were black and Hispanic/Latino, reported high levels of substance use, had high rates of recidivism, and experienced difficult living circumstances. Compared with men, women were more likely to be homeless, use illicit drugs, report drug charges at index arrest, have health problems, and be parents. Adolescent males were more likely than men to rely on illegal activities for income and to have used marijuana and alcohol recently, and were less likely to report homelessness or health problems. Ethnic/racial differences between black and Hispanic/Latino respondents within gender and age groups were smaller than differences among these groups., CONCLUSIONS: Jails concentrate individuals with multifaceted health and social problems, providing opportunities to engage at-risk populations in comprehensive reentry programs. Gender, age, and ethnic/racial differences among incarcerated populations require that interventions be tailored to the specific needs of these different groups.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to compare health status, health care use, HIV anti-retroviral medication use, and HIV medication adherence among homeless and housed people with HIV/AIDS., METHODS: Data were obtained from a cross-sectional, multisite behavioral survey of adults (N=7925) recently reported to be HIV positive., RESULTS: At the time interviews were conducted, 304 respondents (4%) were homeless. Self-ratings of mental, physical, and overall health revealed that the health status of homeless respondents was poorer than that of housed respondents. Also, homeless respondents were more likely to be uninsured, to have visited an emergency department, and to have been admitted to a hospital. Homeless respondents had lower CD4 counts, were less likely to have taken HIV anti-retroviral medications, and were less adherent to their medication regimen. Homeless respondents needed more HIV social and medical services, but nearly all respondents in both groups had received needed services. Housing status remained a significant predictor of health and medication outcomes after we controlled for potential confounding variables., CONCLUSIONS: Homeless people with HIV/AIDS are at increased risk of negative health outcomes, and housing is a potentially important mechanism for improving the health of this vulnerable group.

N2  - Homeless youth face various health challenges. The effectiveness of a short intervention to promote sexual health in 572 homeless 16-23-year-olds (M = 19.467+1.89) was conducted using a quasi-experimental repeated measures design. Data collected at three time points (pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention and follow-up) via laptop computers were analyzed using multivariate general linear mixed models. A significant condition by time interaction was found for self-reported AIDS/STD knowledge; intervention participants had higher scores at first post-test. Females scored significantly higher on cognitive and behavioral outcomes while males reported significantly more sexual risk-taking behaviors. Findings support gender-specific interventions.

N2  - The aim of this study was to investigate young homeless people's experiences of ;Strong Minded', a new mental health service set up within selected homeless shelters and run by a voluntary sector organization. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 residents from five homeless shelters across the UK. All of the young people who had accessed Strong Minded had benefited from their engagement. The young people also identified several key inherent and important aspects of Strong Minded relating to both the practical, supportive therapeutic approach and the flexibility of the interventions offered, which contributed to the service's success. This service model of engaging vulnerable young people in transition could have useful implications for the future interface between voluntary and statutory mental health services.

N2  - Development of a global HIV vaccine will require enrollment of a large number of adults and adolescents in clinical trials. Involvement of homeless young adults in these trials will be particularly important because they often practice high-risk behaviors and are disproportionately infected by HIV. This qualitative study explores factors that might affect future participation of homeless 18- to 24-year-olds of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds in HIV vaccine trials (HIVVTs). Twenty males and females attended focus groups. Participants expressed concern about seroconversion, the trustworthiness of the researchers and/or government agencies conducting trials, vaccine side effects, and possible negative behavior change as a result of being vaccinated. Understanding the personal perspectives of high-risk young adults will enable researchers to tailor protocols to their individual needs and cultural values and, in so doing, potentially enhance willingness to participate in HIVVTs.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study identifies self-reported factors facilitating initiation of cocaine and heroin among young problem users in Amsterdam to enable interventions to be targeted at issues personally relevant for this population., METHOD: A qualitative study using in-depth interviews to obtain retrospective drug use histories. Recruitment took place both directly (by street outreach, outreach at methadone outposts) and indirectly (by respondent-driven sampling). The study started in the year 2001 and included 50 problem drug users, aged 18-30, of whom 72% were male, 64% were polydrug users, and 36% were homeless., RESULTS: The seven most common self-reported factors facilitating initiation of cocaine and heroin are desire for affect regulation, drug availability, curiosity, desire to be part of a group, misinformation, desire for energy, and starting because it has a depressant effect., CONCLUSION: Some factors perceived to facilitate initiation of cocaine and/or heroin revealed in this study are hardly addressed by current prevention programs and could inform future initiatives. Programs can be targeted at young people who we identified to be at high risk. Research using quantitative methods is likely to be valuable in determining the relative importance of mentioned factors for different groups of young people. The study's limitations are noted.

N2  - PROBLEM: Homeless families headed by young mothers are increasing. This preliminary study describes the characteristics of 17 homeless teenage mothers (HTM)., METHODS: HTMs completed questionnaires researching depression, self-esteem, maternal competence, and sources of stress and support., FINDINGS: HTMs had positive maternal competence and self-esteem scores. When compared to housed mothers, HTMs were younger, had more depressive symptoms and negative life events, and fewer social supports., CONCLUSIONS: HTMs represent a high-risk group with fewer available supports and many complex life stressors. School-based programs can benefit HTMs by offering support, helping them continue their education, and assisting with on-site school-based childcare.

N2  - BACKGROUND: New injection drug users (IDUs) are at high risk for blood-borne viral infections. Given U.S. policy to only fund proven-effective HIV prevention interventions, insights into conducting intervention trials among young IDUs are provided here by describing methods and participants' characteristics in the CIDUS III/DUIT study., METHODS: In 2002-2004, 15-30-year-old IDUs in Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle were recruited through community outreach, advertising and coupon-based participant referrals. Baseline interviews assessed sociodemographics, injection, and sexual behaviors. Antibody tests for HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses (HAV, HBV, and HCV) were conducted. IDUs who were HIV and HCV antibody negative at baseline were eligible to participate in a randomized controlled HIV/HCV prevention trial. Follow-up assessments were conducted 3 and 6 months post-intervention. Data were analyzed to identify participant differences at baseline by city, trial enrollment, and trial retention., RESULTS: Baseline assessments were completed by 3285 IDUs. Participants were mean age 23.8 years, 69% male, 64% White, 17% Hispanic, and 8% Black. Seroprevalence of HIV, HCV, HBV, and HAV antibodies were 2.9, 34.4, 22.4, and 19.3%, respectively. Of the 2062 (62.7%) baseline participants who were HIV and HCV antibody negative, 859 (41.7%) were randomized. At least one follow-up assessment was completed by 712 (83%) randomized participants. Contextual factors, primarily homelessness, were associated with lower enrollment and retention., CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment and retention of young-adult IDUs for complex intervention trials is complicated, yet feasible. Risk behaviors among participants enrolling in and completing the trial reflected those eligible to enroll.

T1  - Homelessness prevention: the effect of a shallow rent subsidy program on housing outcomes among people with HIV or AIDS.

N2  - This paper presents results of an evaluation of Project Independence (PI), a shallow rent subsidy program with services coordination support for very low income people with HIV or AIDS who live in Alameda County in the San Francisco Bay Area. By providing a small rental subsidy to eligible individuals and their families who are already stably housed, the philosophy of the program is to prevent homelessness before it starts. The housing outcomes of 185 PI clients were compared to those of 218 people who were not enrolled in the program but were presumed eligible for it, controlling for sociodemographic, HIV disease, and behavioral health characteristics. Using survival analysis techniques, non-program participants were found to be more likely to leave their rental housing at any given point in time compared to PI program participants. After one year of follow-up, while 99% of PI clients remained stably housed in their program-subsidized rental unit, only 32% of comparison group clients were still in rental housing. At two years, 96% of PI participants remained independently housed, compared to only 10% of non-participants. The success of the program suggests that Project Independence should be replicated and evaluated in other jurisdictions where a relatively high incidence and prevalence of HIV/AIDS is combined with a lack of affordable housing for low income households.

N2  - We examined the prevalence and risks associated with interpersonal (physical and sexual) abuse among HIV-seropositive homeless or unstably housed adults. Data were obtained from the Housing and Health Study of participants living in Baltimore, Chicago, and Los Angeles (n = 644). We used logistic regression to identify risks associated with abuse. About 77% of men and 86% of women reported ever experiencing abuse. Women were at greater risk than men for intimate partner physical abuse, childhood sexual abuse (CSA), and adulthood sexual abuse. Men and women experiencing intimate partner physical abuse reported increased risk of unprotected sex. Other risks associated with abuse include sex exchange; lifetime alcohol abuse; and depressive symptoms. Abuse prevalence among sample exceeds those found in other samples of general USA, HIV-seropositive, and homeless populations. Identifying persons at risk of abuse is needed to reduce risk among homeless or unstably housed persons living with HIV.

N2  - The purpose of the study was to do an exploratory factor analysis and to examine the criterion-related and discriminant validity of the Lifetime Severity Index for Cocaine (LSI-C), Spanish version. A sample of 171 outpatients from 10 drug centers in Spain participated in the study. We conducted the factor analysis with orthogonal rotation and examined correlations between the LSI-C total score and criterion variables as well as the score obtained by a quality of life measure. The factor analysis revealed 2 principal factors that explain 65.8% of the variance. Lower LSI-C scores were associated with taking medication, receiving social help, using cocaine fewer than 30 times during the previous 6 months, and with better scores on quality of life measures. Higher LSI-C scores were associated with unstable housing, overdose, hospitalization, cocaine consumption more than 100 times during the previous 6 months, and more years of drug consumption. The LSI-C Spanish version shows acceptable criterion-related and discriminant validity.

N2  - Using cross-sectional analysis we examined residential status and associated differences in HIV risk behaviors among 3266 young IDUs enrolled in an HIV prevention trial. A three-level outcome (homeless (37%), equivocally housed (17%), housed (46%)) was defined based on responses to two questions assessing subjective and objective criteria for homelessness: "equivocally housed" participants were discordant on these measures. In multivariate analysis, antecedents of homelessness were having lived in an out-of-home placement, been thrown out of the home or in juvenile detention, and experienced childhood abuse; while correlates included receiving income from other and illegal sources, drinking alcohol or using methamphetamine at least daily, using shooting galleries, backloading, and sex work. A subset of these variables was associated with being equivocally housed. HIV risk varies by housing status, with homeless IDUs at highest risk. Programs for IDUs should utilize a more specific definition of residential status to target IDUs needing intervention.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To improve the nutritional status of homeless children by implementing an educational program for their mothers and the cafeteria staff at a homeless shelter., DESIGN: Program evaluation including before and after measures of mothers' nutritional knowledge and nutritional quality of foods served in the cafeteria., SAMPLE: Fifty-six mothers with children aged 18 months to 6 years and 3 cafeteria staff., INTERVENTION: Four nutrition classes developed by a registered nutritionist were taught to mothers by clinic nurses; 3 nutrition classes were taught to the cafeteria staff by the nutritionist., RESULTS: Mothers scored higher on posttests than on pretests, indicating improved nutritional knowledge. Minimal differences in the nutritional quality of foods served to residents were observed after staff education., CONCLUSIONS: This project demonstrates the challenges of altering the nutritional status of children in a homeless shelter. Despite mothers showing better knowledge of nutritional requirements for children, the types of food served in the cafeteria were an obstacle to them in practicing what they had learned. The cafeteria staff's ability to demonstrate their learning was impeded by the constraints of food donations. Educational strategies may need to be augmented by policies to improve the nutritional status of children in homeless shelters.

N2  - CONTEXT: In the past, nutritional deficiencies were common among homeless families. Because obesity is currently a major public health issue in the United States, it is possible that obesity has supplanted nutritional deficiencies as the "new malnutrition" of the homeless., OBJECTIVE: To perform a pilot study to determine the nutritional status of homeless caregivers and their children in the Baltimore City, Maryland., DESIGN: Determination of weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) (weight in kg/height in m2) of all subjects and correlation with demographic variables., SETTING: Six homeless shelters and transitional houses in Baltimore City., PATIENTS: Thirty-one caregivers and 60 children., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relationship between caregiver BMI and child BMI and comparison of our data to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) norms., RESULTS: Forty-two percent of the children (25 of 60) had a BMI-for-age classifying them as at risk for overweight (18%) or overweight (23%). None were underweight. One hundred percent of girls and 88% of boys under age 7 years were in the normal range for BMI. There were no caregivers in the underweight range for BMI. Seventy-seven percent were either overweight (26%) or obese (51%). When the weight categories of the largely African-American homeless Baltimore caregivers and their children were compared with national data from NHANES 1999-2002 for both African-American poor and nonpoor adult females and children, the Baltimore subjects had the lowest proportion in the healthy range and the highest proportion in the obese (adults) and overweight (children) categories. Caregiver BMI correlated with child BMI: r = 0.43, P = .0002., CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that overweight and obesity are the major forms of malnutrition in homeless families.

T1  - Influence of subject eligibility criteria on compliance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for inclusion of women, minorities, and children in treatment research.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Many alcohol treatment outcome studies exclude some patients with particular problems, such as psychiatric disorders, noncompliance, and homelessness. Such criteria may increase the likelihood of a study being successfully conducted, but may also have the unintended consequence of reducing a study's ability to comply with National Institutes of Health guidelines for inclusion of racial minorities, women, and children in treatment research., METHODS AND RESULTS: This paper examined this issue empirically using 5 prior studies of treatment systems enrolling over 100,000 alcohol patients. Widely used eligibility criteria in the alcohol treatment field typically exclude between one-fifth to one-third of patients from enrolling in research. Under several eligibility criteria, most notably those for drug use and social/residential instability, women and African-American patients are substantially more likely to be excluded than are men and non-African-American patients, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: In designing treatment studies with many eligibility criteria, researchers may therefore inadvertently be thwarting their own good faith efforts to ensure that a range of vulnerable populations are able to participate in research. We analyze the implications of this dilemma for the generalizability of treatment results and for research design, and provide data that may help researchers working in different treatment systems estimate the impact of various eligibility criteria.

N2  - RATIONALE: In 2002, a mobile radiographic screening program was started in Rotterdam to respond to high rates of tuberculosis (TB) among illicit drug users and homeless persons., OBJECTIVES: We studied trends and characteristics of TB among these risk groups and assessed the impact of the screening program on transmission, using molecular typing., METHODS: Description of trends, and of demographic and disease-related characteristics of tuberculosis cases among these risk groups between 1993 and 2005. TB was considered to result from recent transmission if the mycobacterial DNA fingerprints of cases were identical to those of other cases in the risk groups in the previous 2 years., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During the study period, 206 individuals with TB among illicit drug users and homeless persons were notified, representing 11.4% of the total case load of 1,811 in Rotterdam. The annual number of tuberculosis cases declined from 24 at the start of the screening program to 11 cases in 2005. The screening program identified 28 cases (a prevalence rate of 327 per 100,000 radiographs), of which 12 were smear positive. In 1997-2002, more than 80% of the illicit drug users or homeless persons with TB were infected with one of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains prevalent among these risk groups. After nearly 4 years of systematic radiographic screening this proportion declined to 45% in 2005., CONCLUSIONS: DNA fingerprinting can be a useful tool to evaluate the impact of a TB screening program. We advocate that screening of illicit drug users and homeless persons should be continued to prevent a resurgence of TB.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To describe a case of clinically diagnosed oculoglandular syndrome in a 17-year-old patient that was presumed to be due to Bartonella quintana, as suggested by a positive serologic titer., METHODS: The patient presented to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary emergency room with signs and symptoms suggestive of oculoglandular syndrome. He had a follicular conjunctivitis with a conjunctival granuloma of the right eye and an ipsilateral large, tender submandibular lymph node. He had recently acquired a kitten and a clinical diagnosis of cat-scratch disease was made. A laboratory workup was initiated to determine the cause of this clinical presentation and empirical treatment with antibiotics was started., RESULTS: All laboratory results were negative or normal except for the IgM titer to Bartonella quintana, which was elevated. The patient responded well to treatment and his symptoms resolved within a few weeks., DISCUSSION: Bartonella quintana infection, a pathogen prevalent in HIV-infected, homeless, or alcoholic patients, is a possible etiologic agent of cat-scratch disease and the associated condition of oculoglandular syndrome.

N2  - Although the effects of cigarette smoking and/or thinner inhalation on various organs have been investigated, there isn't enough study available in literature about their effects on kidneys. Therefore, in this study we investigated the effect of smoking and/or inhalation on the rat kidney. In this study, stand-alone inhalation of thinner and cigarette smoke and their application together were used to determine histopathologic changes, primarily the influences on rat kidneys. The study included 60 Wistar Albino species male rats. The 60 rats were divided into 4 groups of 15 rats each. Of the groups, three were working groups and the fourth was the control group. The rats in the first study group inhaled thinner only (T), those in the second group cigarette smoke only (CS), and the rats in the third group were made to inhale both thinner and cigarette smoke (TC). Each study group was divided into 3 subgroups each comprising 5 rats and inhalation was continued for periods of 2 wk, 4 wk, and 6 wk. Thinner was vaporized into the cage with a millipore pump at a constant pressure twice per day for 1 h for 5 days (toluene 2800-3000 ppm, acetone 500-600 ppm, isobutyl acetate 7000-8000 ppm, and isobutanol 6000-7000 ppm). Cigarette smoke was given 4 times per day for 15 min each, using a mechanism prepared with an aquarium motor (containing 1.2 mg nicotine,13 mg tar, and 13 mg carbonmonoxide; 60 puffs/min). After that, rat kidneys were removed. The kidneys were weighed and were given macroscopic and microscopic examination. There were significant differences for the thinner and thinner + cigarette smoke groups in comparison to the control group, observed in both proximal and distal tubules. However, changes in the cigarette smoke group were only in proximal tubules and were smaller in extent. Thinner has been widely used as a industrial substance. Thinner usage is an important health problem. Those sniffing thinner generally also use cigarettes. The findings of the present study reemphasize the importance of taking immediate measures in order to prevent thinner inhaling among homeless children, who pose an important social problem, and to protect people who work in industrial branches that widely use thinner.

N2  - This study examined the patterns and correlates of group and organizational involvement among persons with psychiatric disabilities using a cross-sectional, probability sample of 252 residents in supported independent housing (SIH). Groups and organizations were classified according to whether or not they have a behavioral health focus. Demographic, clinical, and service use characteristics were examined as potential predictors of membership using Poisson regression models. Findings indicated that 60% of the sample was involved in some kind of behavioral or nonbehavioral health organization. Similar to the findings from the general population, higher rates of membership were found among older persons, Blacks, those with more years of education, and those with higher incomes. Other correlates specific to the SIH sample included prior homelessness, perceived discrimination, substance abuse history, psychiatric symptoms, psychiatric diagnosis, and contact with service providers. Implications of study findings for developing intervention strategies to enhance organizational membership and for future research are discussed.

N2  - This article describes an innovative trauma-informed care management model in which mental health, substance abuse, and support services are integrated for homeless families in primary care. The rationale for service integration in a health care setting is discussed and the conceptual underpinnings of the model are elaborated, drawing from the literature and clinical experience. Service encounter data collected by each staff member over a 1-year period (N = 7,214 encounters) allow for description of program functions and provider roles and activities, an essential step in developing the fidelity indicators necessary for future program replication and rigorous testing in additional settings. The feasibility of implementing an integrated set of services for homeless families in primary care is demonstrated. Practice, training, and research implications are discussed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study described a cohort of teen mothers and their children attending an urban high school with a parent support program and school-based child care center. Specific aims of the study were to describe maternal characteristics and outcomes, and child developmental and health outcomes., METHODS: A volunteer sample of 65 adolescent mothers enrolled in the parent support program and their children were interviewed, surveyed, and assessed. Fifty-three mothers had children enrolled in the school-based child care center and 12 mothers had their children cared for by family members. Maternal characteristics assessed included self-esteem and depressive symptoms, social stressors and support, self-perceived parental competence, parent-child teaching interactions, and subsequent childbearing and maternal educational outcomes. Child outcomes included child developmental assessments and health outcomes., RESULTS: About 33% of teen mothers were mildly to moderately depressed and 39% of the sample had experienced transitional homelessness. Social support networks were small; in the past 12 months, mothers experienced a mean number of 13.2 +/- 11.9 negative life events. Maternal self-report measures and mother-child observation measures indicated positive levels of parental competence. Maternal educational outcomes were positive, and only 6% of mothers had subsequent childbirths within 2 years. The mean scores on developmental assessments of children fell within the normal range, although there were 7 children identified with developmental delays., CONCLUSIONS: For at-risk teen mothers, this parent support program and school-based child care setting appears to offer promising opportunities to help young mothers with parenting, avoid rapid subsequent pregnancies, and stay engaged with school, while their children are cared for in a close and safe environment.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the temporal trends of initiation into injection drug use, current injection, and recent receptive sharing of injection paraphernalia among street youth., DESIGN: Data from two cohort studies conducted between 1995 and 2005 were combined., METHODS: Recruitment was done on an ongoing basis. Interviews were performed semi-annually. Overall and annual drug injection incidence rates were calculated with the person-time method. Poisson regression was used to assess the predictive power of calendar year on incidence rate. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to assess linear trends in current injection among street youth and in recent receptive sharing of syringe and other injection paraphernalia among current injection drug users., RESULTS: By 31 March 2005, 1633 subjects had completed 8875 questionnaires. Most subjects were born in Canada (94%), their mean age at entry was 20 years, 68% were boys and almost half (44%) had injected drugs before recruitment. Among 778 never injectors at entry, 130 subjects initiated injection in 1898 person-years of follow-up (incidence rate: 6.8 per 100 person-years). When controlling for age, calendar year was not a significant predictor of incidence rate. Prevalence of current injection was stable (around 30%). Odds of both sharing behaviors decreased by approximately 10% per year., CONCLUSIONS: In addition to injection paraphernalia sharing reduction efforts, interventions aimed at preventing initiation into injection drug use among high-risk youth are needed.

N2  - The objective of this analysis was to assess the mortality rate and risk factors in adults, with substance dependence, who are not receiving primary medical care (PC). Date and cause of death were identified using the National Death Index data and death certificates for 470 adults without PC over a period of almost 4 years after detailed clinical assessment after detoxification. Factors associated with risk of mortality were determined using stepwise Cox proportional hazards models. Subjects were 76% male, 47% homeless, and 47% with chronic medical illness; 40% reported alcohol, 27% heroin, and 33% cocaine as substance of choice. Median age was 35. During a period of up to 4 years, 27 (6%) subjects died. Median age at death was 39. Causes included: poisoning by any substance (40.9% of deaths), trauma (13%), cardiovascular disease (13.6%), and exposure to cold (9.1%). The age adjusted mortality rate was 4.4 times that of the general population in the same city. Among these individuals without PC in a detoxification unit, risk factors associated with death were the following: drug of choice [heroin: hazard ratio (HR) 6.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-31.1]; alcohol: HR 3.7 (95% CI 0.79-16.9) compared to cocaine); past suicide attempt (HR 2.1, 95% CI 0.96-4.5); persistent homelessness (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.3); and history of any chronic medical illness (HR 2.1, 95% CI 0.93-4.7). Receipt of primary care was not significantly associated with death (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.34-2.1). Risk of mortality is high in patients with addictions and risk factors identifiable when these patients seek help from the health care system (i.e., for detoxification) may help identify those at highest risk for whom interventions could be targeted.

N2  - SETTING: Tuberculosis (TB) services in six Russian regions in which social support programmes for TB patients were implemented., OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for default and to evaluate possible impact of social support., METHODS: Retrospective study of new pulmonary smear-positive and smear-negative TB patients registered during the second and third quarters of the 2003. Data were analysed in a case-control study including default patients as cases and successfully treated patients as controls, using multivariate logistic regression modelling., RESULTS: A total of 1805 cases of pulmonary TB were enrolled. Default rates in the regions were 2.3-6.3%. On multivariate analysis, risk factors independently associated with default outcome included: unemployment (OR 4.44; 95%CI 2.23-8.86), alcohol abuse (OR 1.99; 95%CI 1.04-3.81), and homelessness (OR 3.49; 95%CI 1.25-9.77). Social support reduced the default outcome (OR 0.13; 95%CI 0.06-0.28), controlling for age, sex, region, residence and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear of sputum., CONCLUSION: Unemployment, alcohol abuse and homelessness were associated with increased default outcome among new TB patients, while social support for TB patients reduced default. Further prospective randomised studies are necessary to evaluate the impact and to determine the most cost-effective social support for improving treatment outcomes of TB in patients in Russia, especially among populations at risk of default.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to identify specific premorbid factors and injury characteristics associated with intentional burn injuries and to compare outcomes for individuals injured by assault and those with unintentional injuries. Participants sustaining major burns from May 1994 to August 2005 and consenting to a multisite, prospective, longitudinal outcome study were included. Etiology of the injury was classified as intentional (i.e., assault) or unintentional. Subjects <18 years old or with self-inflicted burns were excluded. Statistical analysis was performed with t-tests, chi2 tests, and analysis of variance. Eighty patients sustained intentional burn injuries and 1982 subjects sustained nonintentional burn injuries. Compared to patients with nonintentional burns, those with burns related to assault were more likely to be female, black, and unemployed and to have higher rates of premorbid substance use. Between the groups, there were no significant differences in preinjury living situation, education level, history of psychiatric treatment, or hospital length of stay. The intentional-burn group had larger burns and a greater in-hospital mortality rate, and these patients were less likely to be discharged to home. They also demonstrated significantly greater levels of psychological distress during the acute hospitalization but not at follow-up. Understanding the unique characteristics and needs of patients with intentional burn injuries is important because these individuals are less likely to have a steady income and more likely to rely on community social services. Affordable and accessible community-based health services are necessary in order to improve their outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess predictors of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) completion by using structural equation modeling (SEM) among homeless adults, a group at great risk for LTBI and active tuberculosis (TB). LTBI therapy is effective in stemming the progression to active TB, yet treatment adherence among homeless persons is difficult to attain., DESIGN: By using SEM, the authors assessed predictors of LTBI completion among a sample of 494 homeless adults in Los Angeles, CA, who received either a nurse case-managed program (NCM) or a usual care program., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Latent variables were created with the baseline variables of site type, age, intervention status, dissatisfaction with health care, depression, TB risk assessment, alcohol use, heroin or cocaine use, and TB knowledge. Outcome variables included many of the same baseline variables as well as treatment completion., RESULTS: LTBI treatment completion (100% adherence) was significantly and positively associated with participation in NCM, older age, and less heroin or cocaine use. NCM also predicted greater TB knowledge, greater ease of treatment, and more satisfaction with treatment (NCM completion rate = 64%, control rate = 42%)., CONCLUSION: The culturally competent NCM program, combined with active tracking and incentives, was successful in a difficult-to-treat and highly transient population.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of street life on the growth and health status of poor children who live and work full-time on the streets of Dhaka, Bangladesh (street children), independent of the effects of poverty. This was accomplished by comparing 142 street children with 150 poor children who live and work on the streets of Dhaka but who return to their families at night (slum children). Children between 7-14 years old were recruited at locales where street and slum children are typically found. Weight and upper arm circumference did not differ significantly between street and slum children (P > 0.05), but energy reserves, as assessed by skinfolds, were significantly larger in street than in slum children (P < 0.05). There was no wasting in either street or slum children. Although the majority of children in both groups were stunted and underweight, there were no significant differences between groups (P > 0.05). The prevalence of disease symptoms tended to be slightly higher in street children than in slum children, but few of the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). These data do not support the contention that street children are a particularly high-risk group. The greater-than-expected growth and health status of street children, compared to other poor children, may be due to biologically fitter children being more likely to permanently move to the streets and/or to remain on the streets once the move has been made.

N2  - A cross-national survey was conducted among 358 recently homeless young people in Melbourne and Los Angeles. Drug dependence and mental illness were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months. At each time point, participants were classified as no condition, drug dependent, having a mental illness or dual condition. Low levels of drug dependence or mental illness or both were reported at each data point. Most young people were classified as neither drug dependent nor having mental illness at baseline and remained so for the 12-month period and few remained drug dependent, or had continuing mental illness or both. Half to two-thirds of young people classified as having one or both conditions were subsequently reclassified as "no condition". There was no evidence of a consistent pathway from either drug dependence or mental illness to co-morbidity. Most young people reported an absence of mental illness and/or drug dependence at each time point. Improvement from one or both conditions at each transition suggests it may be more effective to provide interventions to address drug dependence and mental health problems to young people early in their experience of homelessness.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the proportion of community-associated Staphylococcus aureus infections due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) at a large county hospital. In addition, we sought to identify the demographic and clinical risk factors associated with CA-MRSA infection., METHODS: Patients were prospectively enrolled if they were admitted to Parkland Hospital and had a positive culture for S. aureus isolated within 72 h of admission. The patients were interviewed using a standardized data questionnaire. Data collected included patient demographics, clinical history, as well as health care and non-health care associated MRSA risk factors. Bacterial susceptibilities were verified through review of microbiology laboratory and pharmacy records. Isolates were tested for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) gene, SCCmec type, and for inducible clindamycin resistance., RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-eight patients were interviewed prospectively, of which eight had colonization without active infection. One hundred and nineteen patients were infected with MRSA and 71 patients were infected with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). Patients with MRSA were more likely to be African-American and unemployed. Patients with MRSA most commonly presented with a skin or soft tissue infection (SSTI): 69% versus 45%, p=0.0012, while patients with MSSA were more likely to have infection of the respiratory tract: 11% versus 3%, p=0.02. Patients with MRSA were more likely to have used antibiotics in the past six months, been homeless, have a history of incarceration, have abused alcohol and have a history of infection with MRSA. In multivariate analysis, African-American race, antibiotics in the past six months, and a history of being homeless were associated with MRSA infection. Only 11 of 119 (9%) MRSA patients did not have at least one of these risk factors. PVL gene was present in 72 of 74 (97%) MRSA isolates and SCCmec type IV was present in 63 of 75 (84%) MRSA isolates., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients hospitalized with community-associated S. aureus infections were due to MRSA, most of which involved an SSTI. African-American race, recent antibiotics and past homeless status predicted infection with MRSA; however, no clinical profile could reliably exclude MRSA. Clinicians should be aware of the increasing prevalence of CA-MRSA.

N2  - Tuberculosis incidence in New York City (NYC) declined between 1992 and 2000 from 51.1 to 16.6 cases per 100,000 population. In January 2001, universal real-time genotyping of TB cases was implemented in NYC. Isolates from culture-confirmed tuberculosis cases from 2001 to 2003 were genotyped using IS6110 and spoligotype to describe the extent and factors associated with genotype clustering after declining TB incidence. Of 2408 (91.8%) genotyped case isolates, 873 (36.2%) had a pattern indistinguishable from that of another study period case, forming 212 clusters; 248 (28.4%) of the clustered cases had strains believed to have been widely transmitted during the epidemic years in the early 1990s in NYC. An estimated 27.4% (873 minus 212) of the 2408 cases were due to recent infection that progressed to active disease during the study period. Younger age, birth in the United States, homelessness, substance abuse and presence of TB symptoms were independently associated with greater odds of clustering.

N2  - Comprehensive intervention for homeless, street living youth that addresses substance use, social stability, physical and mental health issues has received very little attention. In this study, street living youth aged 14-22 were recruited from a drop-in center and randomly assigned to the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) or treatment as usual (TAU) through a drop-in center. Findings showed that youth assigned to CRA, compared to TAU, reported significantly reduced substance use (37% vs. 17% reduction), depression (40% vs. 23%) and increased social stability (58% vs. 13%). Youth in both conditions improved in many other behavioral domains including substance use, internalizing and externalizing problems, and emotion and task oriented coping. This study indicates that homeless youth can be engaged into treatment and respond favorably to intervention efforts. However, more treatment development research is needed to address the barriers associated with serving these youth.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Non-fatal overdose is a major determinant of morbidity among injection drug users (IDU). We sought to evaluate factors associated with non-fatal overdose among IDU in Vancouver., METHODS: We examined non-fatal overdose among participants in the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study. Correlates of non-fatal overdose occurring between 1996 and 2004 were identified using generalized estimating equations (GEE)., RESULTS: There were 1587 participants included in this analysis, including 576 (36%) women. At baseline, 750 (47%) reported a history of non-fatal overdose. In total, 985 reports of non-fatal overdose were made during follow-up by 519 (32.7%) participants. In multivariate GEE analyses, factors independently associated with non-fatal overdose included: heroin injection (AOR=2.67), cocaine injection (AOR=2.01), benzodiazepine use (AOR=2.00), requiring help injecting (AOR=1.58), binge drug use (AOR=1.52), homelessness (AOR=1.38), alcohol use (AOR=1.32), street injecting (AOR=1.22), non-injectable opiate use (AOR=1.16), speedball use (AOR=1.15), and recent incarceration (AOR=1.14). Younger age (AOR=0.99) and methadone use (AOR=0.51) were protective., CONCLUSIONS: We found that non-fatal overdose was common among local IDU. Non-fatal overdose was associated with several factors that may be amenable to intervention, including opiate and stimulant use, and the characteristic of requiring help with injecting. These findings indicate the need for the ongoing development of structural interventions to address this common cause of morbidity among IDU.

T1  - Attempted and completed suicide in adolescence.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Suicide is the third leading cause of death in adolescence, and medically serious suicide attempts occur in approximately 3% of adolescents. This review examines a number of risk factors that contribute to suicidal behavior. A prior suicide attempt is one of the best predictors of both a repeat attempt and eventual completed suicide. Depression, disruptive behavior disorders, and substance-use disorders also place adolescents at high risk for suicidal behavior, with comorbidity further increasing risk. Research on families indicates that suicidal behavior is transmitted through families. Groups at high risk for suicidal behavior include gay, lesbian, and bisexual youths, incarcerated adolescents, and homeless/runaway teens. Although abnormalities in the serotonergic system have not been consistently linked to suicidal behavior, genetic and neurobiologic studies suggest that impulsive aggression may be the mechanism through which decreased serotonergic activity is related to suicidal behavior. Findings from prevention and intervention studies are modest and indicate the need for substantially more theory-driven treatment research.

N2  - Although the importance of medical research for the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases is unquestionable, the use of human subjects, however, still presents a complex ethical problem. Moral difficulties occur in particular when the medical research deals with vulnerable subjects. Vulnerable individuals are defined as those who experience diminished actual autonomy. Among the groups which should be considered as being vulnerable are usually listed the following: children, pregnant women, mentally or emotionally disabled, physically disabled, homeless, and institutionalized people. This study addresses key concerns that gave rise to the question of whether unemployed people had to be recognized as vulnerable subjects. The term "vulnerability" was clarified and it was assumed that the "vulnerability" of medical research subjects' had to be understood as a form of continuum from potential, through the circumstantial, temporal, episodic, permanent to inevitable vulnerability. The conclusion was drawn that unemployed people were, at least, potentially vulnerable subjects. Research involving unemployed people presents important moral challenges to researchers and should be undertaken very carefully, following special ethical guidelines.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Homeless families are an increasing but marginalised part of society. They have diverse and complex needs that have often not been addressed by the available services. There is some evidence that psychosocial factors continue to be detrimental to the mental health of these families even after rehousing., METHOD: Thirty-five homeless families were assessed on their mental health (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Eyberg Child Behaviour Inventory Scale, Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents), parenting problems (Parenting Daily Hassles Scale), and service satisfaction (semi-structured interview) following admission to two homeless hostels, and four months later, when most families (69%) had been rehoused in the community., RESULTS: Children and their mothers continued to experience high rates of mental health problems whilst resident in the hostels and after rehousing. However, a proportion of parents expressed a subjective improvement, which was often associated with their housing and social circumstances. A diverse range of further needs was described., CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to address the complex problems experienced by these families, with housing only forming one aspect of this provision. Interagency strategy, commissioning and services are required to meet the needs of this vulnerable group of parents and children.

N2  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: Food insecurity, now listed among the social determinants of health, compromises the health and well-being of affected Australians. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of food insecurity within an urban population of social disadvantage in readiness for a local health promotion response., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey conducted in three disadvantaged locations of south-western Sydney. Prevalence of food insecurity was assessed using both the 16-item US Household Food Security Survey Module and the single-item question previously used in national Australian health surveys. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations between food insecurity and socio-demographic characteristics of the households., RESULTS: The 16-item US tool yielded a significantly higher food insecurity prevalence (21.9%, 95% CI 20.0-23.8) than the single-item Australian tool (15.8%, 95% CI 14.1-17.5). Compared with the former, the single-item Australian tool has high specificity (96%) yet low sensitivity (56.9%). In our three sites, food insecurity was strongly and independently associated with household capacity to save money (AOR=5.05). Local fruit and vegetable production (83.8%), nutrition education (83.9%), transport to food outlets (81.5%) and better public transport overall (76.3%) were most highly rated by 'food insecure' households as useful future strategies., CONCLUSION: The higher sensitivity of the US 16-item food security survey module relative to the single-item Australian tool indicates its potential for use in future Australian surveys of food insecurity.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Health promotion and disease prevention have been increasingly recognized as activities that may be within the scope of emergency medicine. The purpose of this feasibility study was to identify health risks and offer immediate interventions to adult patients who have drug and/or alcohol problems, incomplete immunization, are overdue for a Pap (Papanicolaou) smear, and/or are smokers., METHODS: The study took place in a busy tertiary Emergency Department (ED) serving an inner-city population with a significant proportion of patients who are homeless, substance abusers, working poor, and/or recent immigrants. A convenience sample of patients completed a computer-based health-risk survey. Trained health promotion nurses offered appropriate interventions to patients following review and discussion of their self-reported data. Interventions included counseling for problem drinking, substance abuse, and smoking cessation, screening for cervical cancer, and immunization., RESULTS: From October 20, 2000 to June 30, 2003, we enrolled 2366 patients. One thousand and eleven subjects (43%) reported substance abuse and 1095 (46%) were smokers. Of the 158 smokers contacted in follow-up, 19 (12%) had quit, 63 (40%) had reduced the number of cigarettes/day and 76 (48%) reported no change. Of 1248 women surveyed, 307 (25%) were overdue for a Pap smear and 54 (18%) received this intervention. Forty-four percent of subjects were overdue for at least one immunization and of those, 414 (40%) were immunized in the ED., CONCLUSION: At-risk patients can be identified using a computer-based screening tool, and appropriate interventions can be given to a proportion of these patients in a busy inner city ED without increasing wait time.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Extrafamilial sexual abuse experiences of young adolescents (ages 10-14), particularly young teen boys, are not well studied. This retrospective chart review study compared psychosocial correlates and victimization experiences between young adolescent girls (n = 226) and boys (n = 64) referred to a hospital child advocacy center. Several differences in risk behaviors and abuse experiences were found: Girls were more likely to have run away, to be truant from school, to report substance use, to have multiple perpetrators, and to have physical findings from the abuse. Boys were more likely to have a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder and to report anal penetration, and rarely disclosed abuse at the time of the incident. Peers were girls' most common choice for disclosing abuse, whereas boys confided most often in their mothers or other adults. These findings suggest sexually abused young adolescent girls and boys need distinct, developmentally appropriate screening and care in school and health care settings.

N2  - In this research, juvenile offenses and associated behaviors among adolescent inhalant users in Istanbul were investigated and inhalant users living in the street were compared to inhalant users living with their families. An interview questionnaire developed by the researchers was administered to 200 male adolescent inhalant users who were hospitalized during 2002-2003. More than half of the sample had committed juvenile offenses at least once in their lifetime, 16.3% had entered a house of corrections, 91.5% had friends who committed juvenile offenses, and the majority had been taken to a police station at least once in their lifetime. The rates for juvenile offenses, being taken to the police station, committing crimes to obtain money to buy drugs, and obtaining income through illegal activities were higher among adolescents living in the street than adolescents living with their families. Although the juvenile offense rate was higher among adolescents living in the street, it can be suggested that both groups live in subcultures that have a tendency towards crime, and inhalant use is part of these subcultures. Juvenile offense interventions can be useful for all inhalant users.

N2  - This study examined risk factors for reoffending by youth in grandparent-headed homes and those in parent-headed homes. Using data abstracted from the juvenile justice records of youth in a variety of living arrangements, we compared the records of 29 youth living in grandparent-headed homes with those of 37 youth living in parent-headed homes. Youth in grandparent-headed homes were significantly more likely to have risk factors and needs associated with reoffending. The findings suggest that youth in grandparent-headed homes are at greater risk for reoffending and that factors predisposing youth in grandparent-headed homes to reoffend may differ from those that predispose youth in non-grandparent-headed homes.

N2  - PURPOSE: Solitary maternity is a significant problem of modern times requiring socio-economic and psychological, as well as perinatological studies. The twentieth anniversary of the Maternity Home managed by the Benedictine Samaritan Sisters motivated the present study., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Hospital discharge summaries of 429 women (group DSM) who lived at the Maternity Home between 26 July 1983 and 26 February 2002 were analyzed. This documentation was supplemented with hospital data on 177 women who gave birth at two Szczecin hospitals and on 13 who left the Home before delivery., RESULTS: Residents of the Home came from all regions of Poland and from urban and rural societies. They were between 14 and 43 years of age (mean 22.6 +/- 5.7). 87.4% of them were single and 63.7% were primipara. 50.4% of them failed to complete primary education while 3.4% had university-level education. 6% were mentally and/or psychologically handicapped and 42.7% had no profession. The major causes of admission into the Home were: desire to hide the pregnancy, family conflicts, homelessness, difficult material situation, mental or physical disability, violence or alcoholism in the family. The control group comprised 400 women (group K) who gave birth at the Department of Obstetrics and Perinatology, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin. 51.5% of them were primipara. The mean age in this group was 27.4 +/- 5.4 (17-44). 71.3% were married. The Majority had secondary (41.9%) or university (32.5%) education. Most of them worked as artisans, teachers or economists. Neurological or psychiatric diseases dominated in group DSM but otherwise no severe disease at all could be disclosed. Satisfactory prenatal care was provided to 33.1% of DSM patients and to 78% of group K. No prenatal care was provided to 9.5% of DSM patients and to 1.7% of group K. EPH gestosis was more often observed in DSM patients and imminent abortion, premature birth, PROM, urinary tract infection, and anaemia were more frequent in controls. More DSM patients had no treatment during pregnancy than controls. The use of tocolytics was significantly more frequent in DSM patients. Antibiotics and drugs accelerating maturation of the respiratory system were applied with similar frequency in both groups. Frequency of immature and mature births was similar in both groups. 84.2% of DSM patients and 68.8% of controls had natural delivery. Cesarian section was twice more frequent in group K. Immediate indications dominated in both groups (74.1% in DSM; 57.4% in K). No medication was used during delivery in 30% of patients. DSM patients more often required strong analgesics. Antibiotics and agents increasing uterine tension more often were used in K patients. Deliveries in both groups were usually without complications. Female genital tract injury was more frequent in DSM patients (20.9% in DSM; 14.8% in K). Delivery duration was similar in both groups, but the second part of delivery was longer in K primipara. Mean neonatal weight in the 1000-2500 g range was similar in both groups but was significantly higher in controls for 2501-4000 g neonates. The difference for newborns weighing more than 4000 g was not significant. There were no neonates weighing less than 1000 g. The clinical condition of newborns measured with the Apgar scale was worse in the DSM group after the 1st min, as well as after the 3rd and 5th min and the difference in each case was significant. Puerperium was usually uncomplicated. However, urinary tract infection was more frequent in DSM patients and anaemia was more frequent in controls. The duration of hospitalisation was similar in both groups (mean = 6 days). 120 of 177 DSM mothers left hospital together with their children, as compared to 99.3% in the control group. 87 children of mothers from the Maternity Home were offered for adoption., CONCLUSION: By studying unwed maternity it was observed that a holistic approach is the only way to disclose all the problems which are often unusually complex and concealed but which determine the normal development of an individual in the society. Analysis of the factors involved may help in attaining goals that serve the good of the society.

N2  - This article examines how newly homeless adolescents' discrimination experiences were associated with exiting homelessness after 6 months. A sample of 262 homeless adolescents, aged 12 to 20 years, were recruited and followed longitudinally (6-month retention rate = 88%). Discrimination was related to being gay, lesbian, or bisexual (LGB). Discrimination from family was related to exiting homelessness. Other than those who were LGB, adolescents who reported discrimination from their families were more likely to exit homelessness than adolescents who did not report such discrimination. Suggestions for future research include focusing on the experiences of LGB homeless adolescents, the role of families in the lives of homeless adolescents, and other aspects of discrimination, including salience, frequency, intensity, and duration.

N2  - Tuberculosis causes an ever-increasing public health burden throughout the world and is one of the World Health Organization's top priorities. In France, the incidence of tuberculosis has been stable at around 10 cases per 100 000 inhabitants per year since 1997. In 2004, the incidence rate in 2004 was 9.2 per 100 000, with substantial geographic disparities: the Ile-de-France region (including Paris and its suburbs) accounted for more than 40% of all reported cases (20.8 per 100 000). Incidence rates of tuberculosis vary according to the geographic origin: in France, this rate is highest among people from sub-Saharan Africa (incidence rate: 166.7 per 100.000 compared with 5.0 per 100.000 for those born in France). Pulmonary tuberculosis is the disease form most commonly observed (71.5% of cases). Among those cases, 76.9% were laboratory-confirmed in 2004. National guidelines to improve case management and disease control were updated in 2003 and 2005. Funding must be made available to reinforce tuberculosis surveillance and to conduct public health initiatives targeted at the populations most at risk.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Many persons with HIV infection do not receive consistent ambulatory medical care and are excluded from studies of patients in medical care. However, these hard-to-reach groups are important to study because they may be in greatest need of services., OBJECTIVE: This study compared the sociodemographic, clinical, and health care utilization characteristics of a multisite sample of HIV-positive persons who were hard to reach with a nationally representative cohort of persons with HIV infection who were receiving care from known HIV providers in the United States and examined whether the independent correlates of low ambulatory utilization differed between the 2 samples., METHODS: We compared sociodemographic, clinical, and health care utilization characteristics in 2 samples of adults with HIV infection: 1286 persons from 16 sites across the United States interviewed in 2001-2002 for the Targeted HIV Outreach and Intervention Initiative (Outreach), a study of underserved persons targeted for supportive outreach services; and 2267 persons from the HIV Costs and Services Utilization Study (HCSUS), a probability sample of persons receiving care who were interviewed in 1998. We conducted logistic regression analyses to identify differences between the 2 samples in sociodemographic and clinical associations with ambulatory medical visits., RESULTS: Compared with the HCSUS sample, the Outreach sample had notably greater proportions of black respondents (59% vs. 32%, P = 0.0001), Hispanics (20% vs. 16%), Spanish-speakers (9% vs. 2%, P = 0.02), those with low socioeconomic status (annual income < Dollars 10,000 75% vs. 45%, P = 0.0001), the unemployed, and persons with homelessness, no insurance, and heroin or cocaine use (58% vs. 47%, P = 0.05). They also were more likely to have fewer than 2 ambulatory visits (26% vs. 16%, P = 0.0001), more likely to have emergency room visits or hospitalizations in the prior 6 months, and less likely to be on antiretroviral treatment (82% vs. 58%, P = 0.0001). Nearly all these differences persisted after stratifying for level of ambulatory utilization (fewer than 2 vs. 2 or more in the last 6 months). In multivariate analysis, several variables showed significantly different associations in the 2 samples (interacted) with low ambulatory care utilization. The variables with significant interactions (P values for interaction shown below) had very different adjusted odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) for low ambulatory care utilization: age greater than 50 (Outreach 0.55 [0.35-0.88], HCSUS 1.17 [0.65-2.11)], P = 0.05), Hispanic ethnicity (Outreach 0.81 [0.39-1.69], HCSUS 2.34 [1.56-3.52], P = 0.02), low income (Outreach 0.73 [0.56-0.96], HCSUS 1.35 [1.04-1.75], P = 0.002), and heavy alcohol use (Outreach 1.74 [1.23-2.45], HCSUS 1.00 [0.73-1.37], P = 0.02). Having CD4 count less than 50 was associated with elevated odds of low ambulatory medical visits in the Outreach sample (1.53 [1.00-2.36], P = 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with HCSUS, the Outreach sample had far greater proportions of traditionally vulnerable groups, and were less likely to be in care if they had low CD4 counts. Furthermore, heavy alcohol use was only associated with low ambulatory utilization in Outreach. Generalizing from in care populations may not be warranted, while addressing heavy alcohol use may be effective at improving utilization of care for hard-to-reach HIV-positive populations.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Peer use of take home naloxone has the potential to reduce drug related deaths. There appears to be a paucity of research amongst homeless drug users on the topic. This study explores the acceptability and potential risk of peer use of naloxone amongst homeless drug users. From the findings the most feasible model for future treatment provision is suggested., METHODS: In depth face-to-face interviews conducted in one primary care centre and two voluntary organisation centres providing services to homeless drug users in a large UK cosmopolitan city. Interviews recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically by framework techniques., RESULTS: Homeless people recognise signs of a heroin overdose and many are prepared to take responsibility to give naloxone, providing prior training and support is provided. Previous reports of the theoretical potential for abuse and malicious use may have been overplayed., CONCLUSION: There is insufficient evidence to recommend providing "over the counter" take home naloxone" to UK homeless injecting drug users. However a programme of peer use of take home naloxone amongst homeless drug users could be feasible providing prior training is provided. Peer education within a health promotion framework will optimise success as current professionally led health promotion initiatives are failing to have a positive impact amongst homeless drug users.

N2  - The short-term results of a randomized trial testing a brief feedback and motivational intervention for substance use among homeless adolescents are presented. Homeless adolescents ages 14-19 (N = 285) recruited from drop-in centers at agencies and from street intercept were randomly assigned to either a brief motivational enhancement (ME) group or 1 of 2 control groups. The 1-session motivational intervention presented personal feedback about patterns of risks related to alcohol or substance use in a style consistent with motivational interviewing. Follow-up interviews were conducted at 1 and 3 months postintervention. Youths who received the motivational intervention reported reduced illicit drug use other than marijuana at 1-month follow-up compared with youths in the control groups. Treatment effects were not found with respect to alcohol or marijuana. Post hoc analyses within the ME group suggested that those who were rated as more engaged and more likely to benefit showed greater drug use reduction than did those rated as less engaged. Limitations of the study are discussed as are implications for development of future substance use interventions for this high-risk group. Copyright ((c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved).

N2  - There is a dearth of research that examines the impact of family systems therapy on problems among sexually and/or physically abused youth. Given this void, differential outcome and predictors of substance use change were evaluated for abused, as compared with nonabused, runaway adolescents who were randomly assigned to family therapy or treatment as usual. Abused adolescents reported lower family cohesion at baseline, although both abused and nonabused adolescents showed similar substance use reductions. Utilizing hierarchical linear modeling, we found that substance use changed with change in cohesion over time. These findings link change in family functioning to change in adolescent substance use, supporting fiamily systems theory. Findings suggest that a potent target of intervention involves focus on increasing positive communication interactions.

N2  - This study compared the costs and outcomes associated with three treatment programs that served 149 individuals with dual disorders (i.e., individuals with co-occurring severe mental illness and substance use disorders) who were homeless at baseline. The three treatment programs were: Integrated Assertive Community Treatment (IACT), Assertive Community Treatment only (ACTO), and standard care (Control). Participants were randomly assigned to treatment and followed for a period of 24 months. Clients in the IACT and ACTO programs were more satisfied with their treatment program and reported more days in stable housing than clients in the Control condition. There were no significant differences between treatment groups on psychiatric symptoms and substance use. The average total costs associated with the IACT and Control conditions were significantly less than the average total costs for the ACTO condition.

T1  - Comparison of context-based interaction patterns of mothers who are homeless with their preschool children.
A1  - O'Neil-Pirozzi, Therese M
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the influence of context on interaction patterns used by mothers who are homeless with their preschool children during book-reading and game-playing activities. The impact of mothers' previously determined language functioning on their contextual use of facilitating language utterances was also examined., METHOD: Using a prospective, nonrandomized, comparison group design, mothers read a book and played a game with their preschool children. Facilitating language utterances produced by the mothers in 16 mother-child dyads during each activity were analyzed., RESULTS: Regardless of their language functioning, no significant contextual differences in percentage use of facilitating language utterances were found across mothers. Overall maternal use of facilitating utterances was less than 50%. Across both contexts, mothers used few different types of facilitating language utterances., CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study provides initial evidence of overall consistency of facilitating language utterance use by mothers who are homeless during interactions with their preschool children across contexts, regardless of maternal language functioning. This study provides an initial framework for future research investigating the interactions of families who are homeless and discusses possible language interventions for these at-risk families.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Medial temporal lobe structures such as the hippocampus have been shown to play a critical role in mnemonic processes, with additional recruitment of the amygdala when memories contain emotional content. Thus far, studies that have examined the relationship between amygdala activity and memory have typically relied on emotional content of the kind that is rarely encountered in day-to-day interactions. The present event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigates whether amygdala activity supports emotional memory during the more subtle social interactions that punctuate everyday life. Across four training sessions, subjects learned common first names for unfamiliar faces in the presence or absence of additional contextual information that was positive, negative, and neutral in valence (e.g., "Emily helps the homeless," "Bob is a deadbeat dad," "Eric likes carrots"). During scanning, subjects performed a yes/no recognition memory test on studied and novel faces. Results revealed a functional dissociation within the medial temporal lobe. Whereas a region within the right hippocampus responded strongly to all faces that had been paired with a description, regardless of its valence, activity in the right amygdala was uniquely sensitive to faces that had been previously associated with emotional descriptions (negative and positive > neutral). This pattern of activity in the amygdala was preserved even when the emotional contexts associated with faces could not be explicitly retrieved, suggesting a role for the amygdala in providing a nonspecific arousal indicator in response to viewing individuals with emotionally colored pasts.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the frequency and risk factors of homelessness among a previously identified cohort of patients with schizophrenia in rural China., METHOD: A 10-year follow-up investigation among a 1994 cohort (n = 510) of patients with schizophrenia was conducted in Xinjin County, Chengdu, China., RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (7.8%) experienced homelessness during the follow-up period. The rate of homelessness was 0.9 per 100 person-years during the 10-year follow-up period. Four significant predictors of homelessness remained in the final logistic regression model: living in shabby or unstable house or shelter, positive family history of mental disorders, without income of the patient, and unmarried, divorced, or separated. Risk of homelessness increased substantially with exposure to multiple risk factors., CONCLUSION: Substantial numbers of homeless patients with schizophrenia are challenges for mental health care and public health. Appropriate community-based services, especially housing services, should be crucial for prevention of homelessness in patients with schizophrenia.

N2  - Data from the Women with Co-occurring Disorders and Histories of Violence Study are used to examine characteristics distinguishing mothers currently providing care for all their minor children (n = 558) from mothers separated from one or more minor children (n = 1396). Mothers are described and compared on background characteristics and experiences, well-being and current functioning, situational context, and services used. Analyses control for number of children, race, and years of education. Mothers separated from children have more children, less education, have more often been homeless, in juvenile detention or jail, and have lower incomes than mothers living with all their children. Mothers separated from children have more extensive experiences of traumatic and stressful life events, and the groups differ in current functioning and patterns of services used. While cross-sectional data do not allow causal inferences, challenges faced by mothers have significant implications for policy and programs.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to describe patient, assault, and examination characteristics associated with compliance with follow-up in sexual assault victims., STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive women presenting to an urban hospital after sexual assault over a 36-month period. We compared those who did and did not follow-up by using standardized history, examination, and data collection forms., RESULTS: Eight hundred twelve women met inclusion criteria; 288 (35.5%) attended follow-up. Young age (odds ratio [OR] = 2.70), assault at home (OR = 1.90), amnesia (OR = 1.80), alcohol use (OR = 1.55), genital trauma (OR = 1.55), and receipt of postexamination medications (OR = 1.87) were associated with greater follow-up; homelessness (OR = 0.30), psychiatric diagnosis (OR = 0.34), assault by an intimate partner (OR = 0.47), and cocaine use (OR = 0.29) with less., CONCLUSION: Although only 35.5% of sexual assault victims seek follow-up, we found many factors positively and negatively associated with this. These findings may inform care strategies designed to improve follow-up for women who are at risk for significant sequelae.

N2  - AIM: To determine the oral health status of street children and compare the results with a group of non-working children in Adana, Turkey. Street children are generally defined as any boy or girl for whom the street has become his or her habitual abode and/or source of livelihood; and who is inadequately protected, supervised, or directed by responsible adults., STUDY DESIGN: Demographic data including education, employment and social insurance of parents and number of siblings, was obtained. A formal interview with structured questions was used in order to determine the oral health behaviour of the children. Oral examinations were performed according to the criteria of the WHO oral examination form., RESULTS: The oral health behaviour of street children was significantly different from non-working children. While DMFT and dmft scores of the street youths were significantly lower than the control group, they had higher CPITN scores (p< or =0.001)., CONCLUSION: Street children are commonly faced with oral health problems, especially periodontal problems. Therefore, the dental and periodontal needs of this particular population must be addressed. Oral health policies and preventive services including oral health promotion programmes which aim to give information about dental issues and to make positive changes in behavioural and environmental factors should be developed. The priority should be to control the factors which result in the occurrence of new dental problems.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To study differences between runaways and non-runaways in a mental health clinic and to study differences between runaways in a mental health clinic and legal / shelter system., MATERIAL AND METHOD: Psychiatric records of runaways and non-runaways from Vajira Hospital were collected from June 1994 to October 2003. 21 cases in each group were studied in various factors. 21 runaway cases who were in child and adolescent shelters were interviewed by the researchers., RESULTS: Neglect, sexual abuse, rejection, poverty and truancy were more common in the runaway group. The runaway group had more conduct disorder and substance abuse. Physical abuse, authoritarian and being in custody were more common in runaways in shelters., CONCLUSION: Various factors correlate with running away. These factors lie beneath long before runaway has taken place and understanding and managing them help in preventing and prompt treatment.

N2  - Substantial numbers of food pantry clients are eligible for food stamps but do not receive them. Background characteristics of 14317 food pantry users in Los Angeles were analyzed to provide information helpful in food stamp outreach programs. Ninety percent of food pantry users were living well below poverty level, 59% were Hispanic, and 44% were homeless. Only 15% of the food pantry clients received food stamps, with homelessness and limited English language skills acting as barriers to food stamp program participation.

N2  - Examination of differences between primary alcohol and drug abusing adolescents can provide valuable direction to intervention efforts, though little research in this area has been conducted. The current study compared primary alcohol and primary drug abusing runaway adolescents who were randomly assigned to family therapy or treatment as usual. Baseline differences, as well as response to treatment, were examined separately for alcohol and drug use and by gender. Although few baseline differences were found, hierarchical linear modeling indicated that alcohol and drug abusing male and female adolescents responded differently to therapy. Primary drug using males showed poorer alcohol use outcomes than did primary alcohol abusers. Specifically, alcohol use increased for primary drug using males receiving family therapy, while drug use decreased in all groups. Findings suggest that alcohol and drug use outcomes might be improved at treatment planning through consideration of client's gender and primary alcohol versus drug use.

N2  - AIMS: This paper examines differences between early- and late-onset injection drug users (12-16 years versus 17-24 years) in terms of the antecedents and circumstances of first injection., DESIGN: Cross-sectional retrospective design, using logistic regression. Setting Australia: Sydney, Brisbane, rural New South Wales., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 336 injection drug users aged 16-25 years at the time of interview., MEASUREMENTS: Independent variables included family injection drug use, homelessness and other demographic variables, drugs used prior to the first injection, length of pre-injection drug career, behaviours at time of first injection (e.g. drug injected, reasons/motives for the first injection, risk behaviours)., FINDINGS: Early-onset injection was associated independently with: having a family who injected drugs, having left school early, an unreliable source of income, a short pre-injection drug career, planning of the first injection, reliance on others for administration of the first injection and denial that experimentation was the motive for the first injection. In bivariate analysis, early-onset injection was associated further with: homelessness, being an Indigenous Australian, omission of use of certain pre-injection drugs, group presence at first injection, reliance on others for acquisition of the first needle and syringe and having injected the first time because an injection was offered., CONCLUSIONS: The research shows that early-onset, compared with late-onset injectors, are more likely to have an immediate family who inject drugs and other problematic beginnings in early life. They have an accelerated transition to injection, and differences in autonomy and motivation at first injection. These characteristics may make them more vulnerable to risk taking.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The whole-blood interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) is recommended in some settings as an alternative to the tuberculin skin test (TST). Outcomes from field implementation of the IGRA for routine tuberculosis (TB) testing have not been reported. We evaluated feasibility, acceptability, and costs after 1.5 years of IGRA use in San Francisco under routine program conditions., METHODS: Patients seen at six community clinics serving homeless, immigrant, or injection-drug user (IDU) populations were routinely offered IGRA (Quantiferon-TB). Per guidelines, we excluded patients who were <17 years old, HIV-infected, immunocompromised, or pregnant. We reviewed medical records for IGRA results and completion of medical evaluation for TB, and at two clinics reviewed TB screening logs for instances of IGRA refusal or phlebotomy failure., RESULTS: Between November 1, 2003 and February 28, 2005, 4143 persons were evaluated by IGRA. 225(5%) specimens were not tested, and 89 (2%) were IGRA-indeterminate. Positive or negative IGRA results were available for 3829 (92%). Of 819 patients with positive IGRA results, 524 (64%) completed diagnostic evaluation within 30 days of their IGRA test date. Among 503 patients eligible for IGRA testing at two clinics, phlebotomy was refused by 33 (7%) and failed in 40 (8%). Including phlebotomy, laboratory, and personnel costs, IGRA use cost $33.67 per patient tested., CONCLUSION: IGRA implementation in a routine TB control program setting was feasible and acceptable among homeless, IDU, and immigrant patients in San Francisco, with results more frequently available than the historically described performance of TST. Laboratory-based diagnosis and surveillance for M. tuberculosis infection is now possible.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To compare directly observed treatment (DOT) of tuberculosis through pharmacy offices with self-administered treatment (SAT) in patients at risk for non-adherence., METHODS: Prospective study for DOT (1999-2002) and retrospective study for SAT (1996-1998) in patients at risk for non-adherence (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection, alcoholism, illicit drug use, immigrant or homeless status and/or previous failure to complete). Patients in the DOT programme received medication as out-patients twice a week in pharmacies that supervised adherence and provided socio-sanitary support to patients., RESULTS: There were 101 and 112 patients in the DOT and SAT groups, respectively. Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in both groups. Differences were observed in risk factors for non-adherence (more immigrants and fewer intravenous drug users in the DOT vs. the SAT groups; P < 0.05). In the DOT group, 76 patients (75.2%) completed treatment and were cured compared to only 30 patients (26.7%) in the SAT group (P < 0.001). Implementation of DOT increased the cost of treatment by 400 Euro per patient compared to SAT., CONCLUSION: In patients at risk for non-adherence, DOT implemented through pharmacy offices was better than SAT; however, completion rates were still low.

N2  - PURPOSE: Current Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines recommend that sexually transmitted disease (STD) screening measures for high-risk populations such as homeless youth prioritize testing in out-of-clinic settings and incorporate new approaches to STD eradication, such as field-delivered testing and treatment and patient-delivered partner therapy (PDPT). Our non-medically trained research staff offered field-based STI testing, field-delivered therapy, and PDPT to homeless youth in the context of a longitudinal study., METHODS: A total of 218 ethnically diverse (34% female) 15-24-year-old homeless youth recruited from street sites in San Francisco completed an audio computer-administered self-interview survey and provided a first-void urine sample for testing for chlamydia (CT) and gonorrhea (GC). Youth testing positive were offered field-delivered therapy and PDPT. A random subset of 157 youth was followed prospectively, of whom 110 (70%) were interviewed and 87 (55%) retested at six months., RESULTS: At baseline, 99% of youth in the study consented to STI testing, of whom 6.9% and .9% tested positive for CT and GC, respectively. Ninety-four percent of positive youth were treated, 50% within one week. The incidence rate for CT was 6.3 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-18.4) and for GC was 4.2 per 100 person-years (95% CI: .5-15.2). None of the youth treated by study staff and tested six months later (n = 6) had CT or GC on follow-up testing (95% CI: 0-131.3)., CONCLUSIONS: Field-delivered testing and field-delivered therapy are feasible, acceptable and effective interventions for the diagnosis and treatment of STDs in homeless youth. These measures along with PDPT may decrease rates of subsequent reinfection.

N2  - Past research has found that a positive working alliance between clients and their case managers is modestly correlated with client outcomes. The current study tried to identify the predictors of the working alliance in a sample of 115 clients who were receiving services from Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) teams. All of the clients suffered from severe mental illness, had a substance use disorder and were homeless at baseline. Both the client's rating and the case manager's rating of the working alliance were assessed at 3 months and 15 months post baseline. Client characteristics, particularly motivation to change, explained more of the variance of the client's rating of the alliance than treatment variables or client change on the outcome variables. On the other hand, treatment variables (e.g., the amount of transportation services provided) and client change on the outcome variables explained more of the variance of the case manager's rating of the alliance.

N2  - The objective of this study was to identify correlates of suicidal ideation and to examine the hypothesis that injection drug users (IDUs) were more likely to report suicidal ideation than noninjection drug users (NIDUs). Participants included IDUs (n = 244) and NIDUs (n = 73) from Baltimore, Maryland, aged 15-30 who began snorting or smoking heroin or cocaine/crack (NIDUs) or injecting drugs (IDUs) within the past 5 years who were recruited between August 2000 and March 2002. Among the 317 participants, 42% were female, 59% were white, and median age was 24. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 27%. IDUs were more likely to report suicidal ideation than NIDUs (31% vs. 14%, p = 0.003). Adjusting for age, gender, and race, IDUs were 2.4 times more likely than NIDUs to report suicidal ideation [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.1-5.2]. However, on further adjustment for homelessness, depressive symptoms, and gay/lesbian/bisexual identity, IDU status was no longer independently associated with suicidal ideation. These results suggest that factors associated with injection drug users' lifestyles and mental health status may account for the higher prevalence of suicidal ideation in IDUs vs. NIDUs. Further study into these associations is warranted in identifying avenues for suicide prevention among these populations.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The provision of early intervention services for people with psychosis is UK government policy, although evidence for benefit of such services is sparse., AIMS: To evaluate the effects of a service providing specialised care for early psychosis (the Lambeth Early Onset Team) on clinical and social outcomes, and on service user satisfaction., METHOD: One hundred and forty-four people with psychosis, presenting to mental health services for the first or second time (if previously failed to engage in treatment), were randomly allocated to care by the early onset team or to standard care. Information was obtained on symptoms, treatment adherence, social and vocational functioning, satisfaction and quality of life. Relapse and rehospitalisation data have been reported separately., RESULTS: Outcomes for the participants treated by the early onset team were significantly better at 18 months for aspects of social and vocational functioning, satisfaction, quality of life and medication adherence. Symptom improvement did not significantly differ between the groups., CONCLUSIONS: The provision of specialised care for early psychosis can achieve better outcomes. The study therefore provides support for current policy.

N2  - AIMS: To determine the effects of cocaine use across the study period on outcomes of treatment for heroin dependence 12 months post-treatment entry., DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort (12 months). Interviews were conducted at baseline, 3 and 12 months., SETTING: Sydney, Australia., PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred ninety-five heroin users recruited for the Australian Treatment Outcome Study and re-interviewed at 12-month follow-up., FINDINGS: Cocaine was widely used among treatment entrants in NSW, with almost all having a lifetime history of cocaine use and almost half having used in the month preceding baseline. While there was an overall decline in cocaine use across the study period, individual use patterns varied widely. Approximately half of the cohort did not report cocaine use at any data point, with the remainder reporting having used at one (29%), two (12%), or at all three (5%) points. Cocaine use across the study period was an independent predictor of most major treatment outcomes, with more cocaine use points predicting poorer outcome. Persistent cocaine use predicted a higher prevalence of homelessness, heroin use, daily injecting, needle sharing and injection-related health problems at 12 months as well as more extensive recent polydrug use., CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine use was common among individuals seeking treatment for primary heroin dependence in NSW. Any cocaine use over the study period was associated with poorer outcomes in virtually all areas. Persistent cocaine use over the study period, however, appeared particularly detrimental. Cocaine use among clients should evidently be a cause for concern amongst treatment providers and may warrant being specifically targeted during treatment.

N2  - Injection drug users (IDUs) acquire the majority of new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and frequently use alcohol. Alcohol abuse accelerates liver disease among HCV-infected persons, can reduce the effectiveness of treatment for HCV infection and may be a contraindication for HCV treatment. HCV seropositive, HIV-negative IDUs aged 18-35 years in Baltimore, New York City and Seattle who were enrolled in a behavioral risk-reduction intervention trial underwent computerized self-interviews to assess baseline alcohol use and dependence and medical history. We measured problem alcohol use using the 10-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scale. Of 598 participants, 84% responded "false" to: "it is safe for a person with HCV to drink alcohol". Problem drinking, defined as score > or =8 on AUDIT, was identified in 37%. Correlates of scoring > or =8 on AUDIT included homelessness, male gender, primarily injecting speedballs, having injected with used needles, prior alcohol treatment and depression. Although most HCV seropositive IDUs in our sample appear informed about their increased risk of liver disease from alcohol, two-fifths screened positive for problem alcohol use. These findings underscore the importance of referring HCV-positive persons to effective alcohol treatment programs to reduce future liver damage and improve eligibility for and effectiveness of treatment of HCV.

N2  - Despite the increase in consumer-driven interventions for homeless and mentally ill individuals, there is little evidence that these programs enhance psychological outcomes. This study followed 197 homeless and mentally ill adults who were randomized into one of two conditions: a consumer-driven "Housing First" program or "treatment as usual" requiring psychiatric treatment and sobriety before housing. Proportion of time homeless, perceived choice, mastery, and psychiatric symptoms were measured at six time points. Results indicate a direct relationship between Housing First and decreased homelessness and increased perceived choice; the effect of choice on psychiatric symptoms was partially mediated by mastery. The strong and inverse relationship between perceived choice and psychiatric symptoms supports expansion of programs that increase consumer choice, thereby enhancing mastery and decreasing psychiatric symptoms.

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - During 1993-2003, incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in the United States decreased 44% and is now occurring at a historic low level (14,874 cases in 2003). The Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis has called for a renewed commitment to eliminating TB in the United States, and the Institute of Medicine has published a detailed plan for achieving that goal. In this statement, the American Thoracic Society (ATS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) propose recommendations to improve the control and prevention of TB in the United States and to progress toward its elimination. This statement is one in a series issued periodically by the sponsoring organizations to guide the diagnosis, treatment, control, and prevention of TB. This statement supersedes the previous statement by ATS and CDC, which was also supported by IDSA and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). This statement was drafted, after an evidence-based review of the subject, by a panel of representatives of the three sponsoring organizations. AAP, the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association, and the Canadian Thoracic Society were also represented on the panel. This statement integrates recent scientific advances with current epidemiologic data, other recent guidelines from this series, and other sources into a coherent and practical approach to the control of TB in the United States. Although drafted to apply to TB-control activities in the United States, this statement might be of use in other countries in which persons with TB generally have access to medical and public health services and resources necessary to make a precise diagnosis of the disease; achieve curative medical treatment; and otherwise provide substantial science-based protection of the population against TB. This statement is aimed at all persons who advocate, plan, and work at controlling and preventing TB in the United States, including persons who formulate public health policy and make decisions about allocation of resources for disease control and health maintenance and directors and staff members of state, county, and local public health agencies throughout the United States charged with control of TB. The audience also includes the full range of medical practitioners, organizations, and institutions involved in the health care of persons in the United States who are at risk for TB.

N2  - The authors examined the relationship among trauma, coping, depression, and mental health service seeking in a probability sample of sheltered homeless and low-income housed women. Results highlight the diversity of trauma. In a longitudinal analysis, women who lived in shelters or experienced major violence had a twofold increase in their risk of depression over the 6-month follow-up. In a cross-sectional analysis, childhood sexual abuse, living in a shelter, physical violence, childhood physical abuse, and death or injury of a friend or relative predicted avoidant coping and symptoms of depression. Active coping and depression predicted mental health service seeking among traumatized women. Modifying coping strategies may ameliorate some of the negative impact of trauma and potentially enhance mental health service use among at-risk women. Copyright 2005 APA, all rights reserved.

N2  - It had been examined 896 inmates of Infant Homes whose mothers resided during pregnancy in different housing conditions. Comparative analysis revealed discrepancies in many medical social indicators. It was found that mothers' habitation lacking was the most pathogenic factor impacting children development. Typically, this factor is associated with lower education, lack of labour employment, toxicomania and socially significant infections. It wes revealed that children of homeless mothers had higher rate of antenatal and postnatal development delay, alcoholic and drug lesion of nervous system. The utterly low possibility of returning to their biological family had been also established

N2  - This study examined the effects of cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBT) on the self-esteem, depression, and self-efficacy of runaway adolescents residing in a shelter in Seoul, South Korea. The study used a control group pretest-posttest design. The experimental group and the control group consisted of 14 and 13 male subjects, respectively, with subjects having been randomly assigned to these groups. The experimental group participated in a CBT that consisted of eight sessions over an 8-week period; the control group did not participate in the program. To examine the effects of the CBT on dependent variables, the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used. The scores on depression decreased significantly (z = -2.325, p = .02) and those on self-efficacy increased significantly (z = -2.098, p = .03) after the intervention in the experimental group. There was no significant change on self-esteem (z = -1.19, p = .23). In the control group, the scores on depression, self-esteem, and self-efficacy did not change significantly after the intervention period. The CBT developed in this study consisted of structured and specific content that could be usefully applied to runaway adolescents residing in a shelter.

N2  - This paper examines housing as a contextual factor affecting drug and sexual risk behaviors among HIV positive people using pooled interview data from 2149 clients presenting for services at 16 medical and social service agencies participating in a multi-site evaluation study. The odds of recent drug use, needle use or sex exchange at the baseline interview was 2-4 times as high among the homeless and unstably housed compared to persons with stable housing. Follow-up data collected 6-9 months after baseline showed that change in housing status was associated with change in risk behaviors. Persons whose housing status improved between baseline and follow-up significantly reduced their risks of drug use, needle use, needle sharing and unprotected sex by half in comparison to individuals whose housing status did not change. In addition, for clients whose housing status worsened between baseline and follow-up, their odds of recently exchanging sex was over five times higher than for clients whose housing status did not change. The provision of housing is a promising structural intervention to reduce the spread of HIV.

T1  - Evolving a model for integrated treatment in a residential setting for people with psychiatric and substance use disorders.
A1  - Mayes, John
A1  - Handley, Samantha
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - This paper discusses the implementation of a residential, integrated treatment program serving dually diagnosed people with histories of homelessness. Attention is focused on the program structure and how the program developed over time. Program modifications tended to relax program rules and embrace a motivational, stage-wise model using harm-reduction principles. Despite initial skepticism regarding these modifications, outcomes such as program retention, abstinence from substances, employment, and hospitalization improved.

N2  - Clients who received crisis services at a homeless shelter for transition-aged youth were recruited for a study to describe the youth served, to track outcomes of care, and to examine factors associated with differing outcomes. Participants were 202 men and women who completed a battery of interviews and self-report measures at intake and at 3 follow-up points. Youth served had experienced high levels of adversity and trauma and typically had poor educational and vocational preparation. A multidisciplinary array of services was provided, and overall, participants showed significant improvement from intake to discharge and in the 6 months after discharge. Background, service, and psychological factors did not predict housing outcomes. Better vocational outcome was associated with more recent work experience. Results point to the need for providers of services to the homeless to be aware of the distinct needs and characteristics of transition-aged youth. Copyright (c) 2005 APA, all rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this study was to construct a prognostic model for HIV seroconversion among injection drug users (IDUs) using easy-to-measure risk indicators., DESIGN: Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used for risk stratification in a heterogeneous population of IDUs with regards to HIV risk-taking behaviors., METHODS: Subjects were recruited in a prospective cohort of IDUs followed between September 1992 and October 2001. A total of 1602 men, seronegative at enrollment with at least 1 follow-up visit, were included in the analyses. Only variables that consistently predict HIV seroconversion in several settings were considered. The final model was used to assign a risk score for each participant., RESULTS: Three risk indicators were included in the risk score to predict HIV seroconversion: unstable housing, average cocaine injections per day, and having shared a syringe with a known HIV-positive partner. Kaplan-Meier survival functions were generated and risk score values stratified in 3 groups. HIV incidence rates per 100 person-years were as follows: 0.91 (95% CI, 0.55-1.52) for the low-risk group, 3.10 (95% CI, 2.49-3.84) for the moderate-risk group, and 7.82 (95% CI, 6.30-9.73) for the high-risk group (log-rank P value < 0.0001)., CONCLUSION: If validated in other settings, this risk score may improve the prediction of outcome and allow more accurate stratification in clinical trials.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the differential prevalence of substance and alcohol use disorders among European Americans, African Americans, and Latinos with schizophrenia (n = 6424) who received public mental health services in San Diego County during fiscal year 2002-2003., METHODS: Data were obtained from the public mental health database used by the San Diego County Mental Health System. Chi-Square analyses and stepwise logistic regression analyses were used to examine differences regarding the prevalence of substance and alcohol use among clients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, and to analyze the sociodemographic variables associated with this co-morbidity., RESULTS: Significant differences in the prevalence of diagnosed co-morbidity were found across the ethnic groups. Rates of co-morbid diagnosis among African Americans (25%) were significantly higher than those among European Americans (22%) and Latinos (19%). Logistic regression results revealed ethnicity was a significant predictor of co-morbid substance and alcohol use, as was being homeless and male. Among Latinos, language preference was also a significant predictor. Latinos who denoted English as their primary language were 1.7 times more likely to be diagnosed with co-morbid substance or alcohol use disorders than Latinos who denoted Spanish., CONCLUSIONS: Among people with schizophrenia, there were significant differences in prevalence rates and predictors of diagnosed co-morbid substance and alcohol use disorders. Future research is needed to examine the relationship among language preference, level of acculturation, and subsequent diagnosing barriers for Latinos. Among African Americans, the reasons behind increased co-morbidity rates need to be examined, and homelessness should be carefully addressed among all three ethnic groups.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To identify factors related to dropping out from tuberculosis treatment in health centers in the departments of Managua and Matagalpa, in Nicaragua., METHODS: This study matched cases and controls (1:1 ratio) by age and by municipality of treatment. The 251 cases were patients over 15 years of age who had dropped out of tuberculosis treatment, and the 251 controls were patients who had completed pharmacotherapy, during the period of January 1998 to December 2001. Data were obtained on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, lifestyle habits, and treatment characteristics. The variables were chosen and grouped using a hierarchical theoretical model. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs)., RESULTS: The risk factors for dropping out of tuberculosis drug treatment were: male gender (OR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.63 to 3.94), an unstable living situation or being homeless (OR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.57 to 6.49), changing residence during the treatment period (OR, 4.22; 95% CI, 2.06 to 9.93), consuming alcoholic beverages (OR, 5.25; 95% CI, 2.43 to 12.94), using illegal drugs (OR, 5.25; 95% CI, 2.43 to 12.94), difficulty in access to the health services (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.39 to 5.29), and a negative opinion of the health care received (OR, 5.33; 95% CI, 1.52 to 28.56)., CONCLUSIONS: It is essential for the health services in Nicaragua to develop measures to reduce the risk of dropout from treatment. In particular, it is important for the health sector to work with community groups that can support the health sector's activities.

N2  - Youth in urban areas with a history of running away from home often have special needs. Importantly, risk factors for HIV/AIDS might be associated with such a history. We assessed the association between having a history of running away from home and the occurrence of HIV infection and risk behavior among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), aged 15-22 years. A cross-sectional epidemiologic and behavioral survey was conducted between 1995 and 1996 in Miami, Florida, as part of a national Young Men's Survey. Of 488 YMSM, the prevalence of HIV infection among those with a history of running away from home was 10.5% (adjusted odds ratio=3.4; 95% CI 1.5-7.8). YMSM who had ever run away were more likely to be HIV infected, be out of school, and have ever had vaginal or anal sex with females, been forced to have sex, injected drugs, and used needles for self-tattooing or body piercing. The prevalence of HIV infection and associated risk behaviors among runaways was high, highlighting the ongoing need for prevention and social support services for youth with a history of running away from home.

N2  - Runaway youth report a broader range and higher severity of substance-related, mental health and family problems relative to non-runaway youth. Most studies to date have collected self-report data on the family and social history; virtually no research has examined treatment effectiveness with this population. This study is a treatment development project in which 124 runaway youth were randomly assigned to (1) ecologically based family therapy (EBFT) or (2) service as usual (SAU) through a shelter. Youth completed an intake, posttreatment, 6 and 12 months follow-up assessment. Youth assigned to EBFT reported greater reductions in overall substance abuse compared to youth assigned to SAU while other problem areas improved in both conditions. Findings suggest that EBFT is an efficacious intervention for this relatively severe population of youth.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Future expectations of youth surviving on the streets of Porto Alegre, Brasil, were examined. The sample consisted of 35 boys and 34 girls aged 10-18 (M age 14.4) who participated in a sentence completion task and semi-structured interviews. Responses to two incomplete sentences regarding the future revealed a mismatch between hoped-for and expected events. When completing the sentence, "In the future, I hope..." the majority of youth gave optimistic (but generally non-specific) responses. In contrast, the sentence "For me, the future..." elicited more pessimistic responses. Few gender or age-related differences emerged. Findings are discussed in light of prior research with general populations of adolescents as well as studies of street youth. Taken as a whole, results suggest that life on the street shapes and constrains how youth see their futures. Implications of the findings for policy makers and practitioners are addressed.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Recent research on the social support networks of homeless and runaway youth suggest the social networks of runaway youth are made up largely of transient deviant peer relationships. This paper examined social network characteristics of 428 homeless and runaway adolescents from small-to moderate-sized cities in four Midwestern states. We investigated size, homogeneity, and correlates of the composition of the instrumental and emotional support networks as reported by the adolescents. Results showed the networks are considerably heterogeneous, comprised of relationships from home and the street as well as family and non-related adults. Further, the composition of these networks is related to adolescent characteristics and experiences including sexual identity, abuse history, and street experience.

T1  - Factors associated with homelessness of adolescents under supervision of the youth protection system.
A1  - Robert, Marie
A1  - Pauze, Robert
A1  - Fournier, Louise
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - There are two factors that limit our knowledge of the risk factors associated with homelessness among runaway adolescents, namely (1) the samples used are often composed of youth homeless service users and/or youths living on the streets (visible homelessness), whereas most adolescents in fact use "private" resources (hidden homelessness), and (2) failure to use an adequate control group to identify risk factors associated specifically with homelessness. Our study compares the characteristics of two groups of youths under the supervision of the youth protection system, according to the presence or absence of periods of homelessness. The results throw light on the factors underlying the shift from "at risk" to "homeless", showing that youths with experience of homelessness are more likely to have been placed in substitute home environments, have experienced significant relationship difficulties with one of their parents (deterioration of the parent/youth relationship and parental abuse) and to have been diagnosed with behavioural disorders. The findings suggest that the decision to place young people under supervision is based more on the dynamic between risk factors rather than on the existence of behavioural problems.

T1  - Homelessness and drug abuse among young men who have sex with men in New York city: a preliminary epidemiological trajectory.

N2  - The objective of this paper is to profile the role of homelessness in drug and sexual risk in a population of young men who have sex with men (YMSM). Data are from a cross-sectional survey collected between 2000 and 2001 in New York City (N = 569). With the goal of examining the import of homelessness in increased risk for the onset of drug and sexual risk, we compare and contrast three subgroups: (1) YMSM with no history of homelessness, (2) YMSM with a past history of homelessness but who were not homeless at the time of the interview, and (3) YMSM who were currently homeless. For each group, we describe the prevalence of a broad range of stressful life events (including foster care and runaway episodes, involvement in the criminal justice system, etc.), as well as selected mental health problems (including past suicide attempts, current depression, and selected help-seeking variables). Additionally, we examine the prevalence of selected drug and sexual risk, including exposure to a broad range of illegal substances, current use of illegal drugs, and prevalence of lifetime exposure to sex work. Finally, we use an event history analysis approach (time-event displays and paired t-test analysis) to examine the timing of negative life experiences and homelessness relative to the onset of drug and sexual risk. High levels of background negative life experiences and manifest mental health distress are seen in all three groups. Both a prior experience of homelessness and currently being homeless are both strongly associated with both higher levels of lifetime exposure to drug and sexual risk as well as higher levels of current drug and sexual risk. Onset of these risks occur earlier in both groups that have had an experience of housing instability (e.g., runaway, foster care, etc.) but are delayed or not present among YMSM with no history of housing instability. Few YMSM had used drug prior to becoming homeless. While causal inferences are subject to the limitations of a cross-sectional design, the findings pose an empirical challenge to the prevailing assumption that prior drug use is a dominant causal factor in YMSM becoming homeless. More broadly, the data illustrate the complexity of factors that must be accounted for, both in advancing our epidemiological understanding of the complexity of homelessness and its relationship to the onset of drug and sexual risk among high risk youth populations.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - The data on diphtheria morbidity and the occurrence of carrier state for its causative agent at the period of 2001-2002 were analyzed. The rates of morbidity and detected carrier state for these years were 0.63-0.55 and 0.65-0.64 respectively. Nevertheless, in spite of the relatively low morbidity rates the presence of the toxic forms of diphtheria (400 patients for two years) and lethal cases (with lethality rate reaching 5.4%) indicated that the epidemic situation in diphtheria remained tense. The most unfavorable situation was observed in the North-Western and Central regions of Russia. In urban areas morbidity rates were still 2- to 3-fold higher in than in rural ones, but the latter showed a higher percentage of severe cases (46.6% in 2001 and 39.7% in 2002) and lethal outcomes (13.6% and 19.2%). The latter was indicative of drawbacks in the immunoprophylaxis, diagnostics and treatment of diphtheria in rural areas. In the total structure of diphtheria patients adults prevailed: 75%. The highest morbidity rates were registered among children aged 3-6 years, among adults in the age groups of 18-19 years and 50-59 years. The epidemic process developed mainly among the immunized population, which was indicated by a high proportion of vaccinated persons among those affected by this infection (62.8-66.6%) and a mild course of the disease in the majority of them. The present epidemiological situation in diphtheria was determined by patients not vaccinated against this infection. The proportion of severe cases among nonvaccinated children was 42.4-51.6% and lethal outcomes, 12.9-15.1%. Among nonimmunized adults these figures were equal to 43.1% and 9.3% respectively. The highest percentage of children, not vaccinated during the first years of their life, was registered among those in the asocial families, refugees and homeless persons. Among adults these were persons above 50 years old, as well as jobless persons of working age, pensioners and invalids, who had limited possibilities of undergoing vaccination due to their social position. It was these social and age groups that should be regarded as risk groups with respect to the severity of the course of diphtheria and lethality. To stabilize diphtheria morbidity, the full complex of prophylactic and antiepidemic measures, and primarily the immunization of the population, should be systematically carried out.

Injection (injecting <or=3 years) and non-injection drug users (heroin, crack, and/or cocaine use <10 years) between 18 and 40 years of age were simultaneously street-recruited into two cohort studies in New York City, 2000-2003, by using identical recruitment techniques. Baseline data collected among young adult men who either identified as gay/bisexual or reported ever having sex with a man were used for this analysis. Nonparametric statistics guided interpretation. Of 95 heroin/ cocaine-using MSM, 25.3% tested HIV seropositive with 75% reporting a previous HIV diagnosis. The majority was black (46%) or Hispanic (44%), and the median age was 28 years (range 18-40). HIV-seropositive MSM were more likely than seronegatives to be older and to have an HIV-seropositive partner but less likely to report current homelessness, illegal income, heterosexual identity, multiple sex partners, female partners, and sex for money/drug partners than seronegatives. These data indicate high HIV prevalence among street-recruited, drug-using MSM compared with other injection drug use (IDU) subgroups and drug-using MSM; however, lower risk behaviors were found among HIV seropositives compared with seronegatives. Large-scale studies among illicit drug-using MSM from more marginalized neighborhoods are warranted.

N2  - Young injection drug users are at heightened risk for acquisition of blood-borne infections because of their high rates of unsafe injection behaviors, yet there has been little research examining the circumstances surrounding injection drug users' first injection experience ('hit'). We examined the relationship between factors associated with young drug users' first hit and their future syringe sharing behaviors among 420 new initiates to injection drug use (less than 5 years), aged 15-30 years old in urban Baltimore, Maryland. Contingency table analysis and logistic regression were used to determine the association between circumstances surrounding the first hit and recent receptive syringe sharing. Participants were primarily male (58.8%), White (71.2%), and were a median age of 24 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 21-27 years). Adjusting for race, gender, and homelessness, the following variables were independently associated with recent receptive syringe sharing: age at first hit (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.92 per year increase; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87-0.98), self-injection at initiation (AOR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.32-0.97) and using a syringe that had previously been used by someone else at first hit (AOR = 2.81; 95% CI: 1.70-4.64). These data suggest that injection-related risk behaviors may be established as early as the onset of injection initiation, supporting the need to educate non-injectors of the harms associated with unsafe injection practices.

N2  - AIMS: To assess the feasibility of implementing the Child Health Assessment at School Entry (CHASE) questionnaire, developed to capture the multiple dimensions of the health of children in their first year at school, and to evaluate data quality, reliability and validity., METHODS: Parents of 278 year-1 children, from 10 primary schools in two London boroughs, received a parent questionnaire and school nurses completed a separate questionnaire from health and education records for children whose parents consented. Additional data on free school meal eligibility and ethnicity were obtained from the two Local Education Authorities. The parent questionnaire included the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and four dimensions of the Child Health Questionnaire Parent Form-28 (CHQ-PF28)., RESULTS: Response rate was 61%. The association between school free school meals eligibility and response rate in each school approached significance (r = -0.62, P = 0.05). Data completeness of the parent questionnaire was high (mean 98%). Data completeness of the school nurse questionnaire was more variable (mean 82%). Cronbach's Alpha was greater than 0.6 for four of the five SDQ scales and greater than 0.7 for the two CHQ-PF28 multi-item scales. Relative to parents with qualifications, parents with no qualifications rated their children as having significantly more conduct problems, peer problems, and overall mental health problems (P < 0.01) as assessed by the SDQ, and significantly lower global health (P < 0.01) as assessed by the CHQ-PF28. Children with special educational needs and children with long-standing illness or disability were rated as having significantly lower global health (P < 0.05) than children without these. Sample tables of inter-school and inter-borough comparison of key findings demonstrate considerable differences in physical and mental health status., DISCUSSION: The questionnaire was acceptable to parents and school nurses, and feasible to implement within existing school resources. Initial tests of internal reliability and validity are satisfactory. These data have the potential to inform interventions and service provision at school and borough level, and public health trends over time.

N2  - Mothers with mental illnesses, who are homeless, as well as their children, are highly vulnerable and need specialized services. This retrospective study describes the experience of the Thresholds Mothers' Project in serving 24 homeless mothers. Benchmarks suggest that the mothers and their children benefited from the program. A year after intake, 79% were still engaged in services and were all living in either independent apartments or in supportive housing. The majority of the children in their mother's care at intake were still living with them 1 year later, 77%. The Mothers' Project provides an exemplary model of how to serve this vulnerable population.

N2  - Homeless people are particularly exposed to ectoparasites, but their exposure to arthropod-borne diseases has not been evaluated systematically. A medical team of 27 persons (7 nurses, 6 infectious disease residents or fellows, 2 dermatologists, and 12 infectious disease specialists) visited the 2 shelters in Marseilles, France, for 4 consecutive years. Homeless volunteers were interviewed, examined, and received care; and blood was sampled for cell counts and detection of bacteremia, antibodies to louse-borne (Rickettsia prowazekii, Bartonella quintana, and Borrelia recurrentis), flea-borne (R. typhi, R. felis), mite-borne (R. akari), and tick-borne (R. conorii) bacterial agents. We selected sex- and age-adjusted controls among healthy blood donors. Over 4 years, 930 homeless people were enrolled. Lice were found in 22% and were associated with hypereosinophilia (odds ratio, 5.7; 95% confidence intervals, 1.46-22.15). Twenty-seven patients (3%) with scabies were treated with ivermectin. Bartonella quintana was isolated from blood culture in 50 patients (5.3%), 36 of whom were treated effectively. The number of bacteremic patient increased from 3.4% to 8.4% (p = 0.02) over the 4 years of the study. We detected a higher seroprevalence to Borrelia recurrentis, R. conorii, and R. prowazekii antibodies in the homeless. Our study shows a high prevalence of louse-borne infections in the homeless and a high degree of exposure to tick-borne diseases and scabies. Despite effective treatment for Bartonella quintana bacteremia and the efforts made to delouse this population, Bartonella quintana remains endemic, and we found hallmarks of epidemic typhus and relapsing fever. The uncontrolled louse infestation of this population should alert the community to the possibility of severe re-emerging louse-borne infections.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - To expand the body of knowledge and provide further insight into the complex area of homelessness and health, health practices of sheltered homeless women were investigated using a cross-sectional, descriptive, and non-experimental design using Pender's Health Promotion Model as the theoretical framework. The sample (n=137) was well educated, mostly unemployed, primarily single, and homeless due to relationship problems/conflict per self-report. Homeless women were noted to practice health-promoting behaviors in all areas but scored the lowest on physical activity and nutrition. Significant findings reflected women's personal strengths and resources in the areas of spiritual growth and interpersonal relations.

N2  - UNLABELLED: There are 47.22 million homeless and runaway adolescents roaming on the streets of our country (Voluntary Health Association of India - VHAI) of which one lakh are in Delhi.1 Very little is known about them, their needs or their experiences., OBJECTIVE: (1). To assess the psychological problems amongst the runaway adolescent boys. (2). To determine possible risk factors., METHODS: This study was cross-sectional in design and done at a child observation home for boys in Delhi. All runaway boys aged 10 to 16 years of age were included in the study. The study was conducted from 15th June to 15th July 2001. A comprehensive schedule consisting of five parts, viz identification data, hopelessness scale for children by Kazdin, Beck depression inventory, Psychological survey questionnaire and RUTTER-B2 scale were used to assess various mental health problems., RESULTS: 20.7% of children were found to have high hopelessness and 8% of children had depression. 2% of children revealed that they had attempted suicide at any point of time in life. Among children with high hopelessness, 3.2% had ever attempted suicide. 8.3% of the depressed children gave history of suicidal attempts. 38% of children gave history of physical abuse, 14.6% of sexual abuse and a large number reported substance abuse. 69.33% were found to have behavioral problems (i.e. scored above the recommended cut off score of 9). 81% of children had antisocial behavior, 7.8% were neurotic and 10.5% remained undifferentiated., CONCLUSION: Runaway adolescents suffer from a wide array of mental health problems and there is a need for a broad based psychosocial intervention programme.

T1  - Tackling the needs of the homeless: a controlled trial of health advocacy.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The objective of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of a health advocate's casework with homeless people in a primary care setting in terms of improvements in health-related quality of life (QoL). The impact of the health advocacy intervention was assessed in a quasi-experimental, three-armed controlled trial. Homeless people moving into hostels or other temporary accommodation in the Liverpool 8 area of the UK and patients registering at an inner-city health centre as temporary residents were allocated in alternating periods to health advocacy (with or without outreach registration) or 'usual care' over a total intake period of 3 years. Health-related QoL outcomes were assessed using three independent self-report measures: the Life Fulfilment Scale; the Delighted-Terrible Faces Scale; and the Nottingham Health Profile. Out of the 326 homeless people who were given baseline questionnaires at registration, 222 (68%) returned usable questionnaires. Out of these individuals, 171 (77.0%) were traceable at follow-up, and 117 (68.4%) follow-up questionnaires were returned. The majority of respondents (n = 117) were women (72%) who were under 30 years of age (74%), white British (91%), and single (63%) or separated (23%), many of whom were living with their children (41%) in either women's refuges (30%) or family hostels (25%). Improvements in health-related QoL were greatest in people recruited and supported by a health advocate early in their stay in temporary housing, in comparison with those in the control group given 'usual care' at the health centre. The model of streamlined care for patients with complex psycho-social needs is shown to be a worthwhile and effective option for primary healthcare providers.

N2  - We conducted Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR), using a qualitative focus group design, to assess factors that might impact participation of high-risk impoverished adults in future HIV Vaccine Trials (HIVVTs). The participants were 40 homeless and low-income adults recruited from subsidized apartments and homeless shelters in Los Angeles. Findings revealed that the participants expressed both concerns and interest in future HIVVTs. Concerns centered on the impact of the vaccine on their physical health, the possibility of seroconverting and its associated stigma. While distrust of the government was pervasive, the participants were interested in receiving more information about the vaccine from the researchers. They also wished to have their voices heard by the researchers early in the design of the vaccines. Motivating factors were also discovered, and included altruism, compensation and access to care. Perception that risk behaviors might increase among some as a result of participation in a future HIVVT was likewise revealed. Implications of the study reveal that while impoverished populations are interested in participating in future HIVVTs, the researchers must address concerns early on. Moreover, the importance of ongoing education and counseling to warn about hazards of engaging in risky behavior while participating in a future HIVVT was critical.

T1  - Experiences of being homeless or at risk of being homeless among Canadian youths.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - A qualitative study was undertaken with four groups--immigrants, youths, Aboriginal people, and landlords--in order to explore, compare, and contrast diversity issues among the homeless population and those at risk of homelessness in a larger Canadian city (Calgary, Alberta) with a smaller city (Lethbridge, Alberta), to better understand their and to needs make recommendations for improvement in service delivery and policy formation. This paper focuses on the findings from our sample of youths who shared information on a range of factors that contributed to their being homeless or at risk of being homeless. The youths in this study also shared their positive as well as negative experiences with educators, peers, family members, and social service providers. Canada's homeless include growing numbers of young people, families, women, and members of various ethnic communities, including Aboriginal people and immigrants. Today it is no longer possible to articulate a single silhouette of the homeless, but rather a diversity of profiles is needed. It was in the light of this reality that a study, "Diversity Among the Homeless and Those At Risk," was carried out. It was undertaken with four groups--immigrants, youths, Aboriginal people, and landlords.

N2  - Childhood sexual abuse and related life traumas, and other psychosocial variables were investigated as contributors to ethnic differences in sexual risk behaviors among women who differed in HIV-serostatus. A multiethnic sample of 457 HIV-positive and HIV-negative women residing in Los Angeles county was recruited and studied over 2 years as part of the UCLA-Charles R. Drew University Women and Family Project (WFP) study. Comprehensive interviews were administered to participants by ethnically- and linguistically matched interviewers. Data on demographic information, sexual trauma, substance abuse/dependence, psychiatric distress, and sexual history and risk behaviors were collected. The sample for these analyses consisted of 155 African American, 153 European American, and 149 Latina women, and nearly two-thirds of the sample was HIV-seropositive. HIV-positive women were significantly more likely to report more posttraumatic stress, chronic stress, negative health behaviors, drug use, and psychiatric history than HIV-negative women. European American and African American women were more likely to report a history of sexual trauma than Latina women. Finally, Poisson regression analyses revealed that history of trauma, ethnicity, drug and alcohol use, homelessness, and being HIV-positive were associated with greater likelihood of engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors, with history of trauma increasing the likelihood of engaging in high-risk behaviors by 5.1%. These findings highlight important differences among women as a function of ethnicity and HIV status, and underscore the need for special services for HIV-positive women that address the risk-enhancing effects of substance abuse/dependence, homelessness, and sexual trauma.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Periodic dilated eye examinations are recommended by the American Optometric Association, American Academy of Ophthalmology, and American Diabetes Association to detect sight-threatening conditions in diabetic patients. However, many patients with diabetes do not receive this recommended eye care and there is limited research to explain why. The objective of this study was to determine reasons some diabetic patients do not receive a dilated eye examination at least every year., METHODS: A chart review identified patients at The Ohio State University College of Optometry who had not been examined for more than a year, but less than two years. A telephone interview was attempted for all subjects., RESULTS: Of 100 eligible subjects, 43 completed the telephone interview. The reasons patients with diabetes did not return for a recommended dilated eye examination included transfer of care to another eye doctor, limited personal mobility due to poor overall health, last examination at a homeless clinic, self-reported lack of insurance, and self-reported apathy., CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to improve compliance of patients with diabetes should include reaching patients of low socioeconomic status and those institutionalized for poor overall health. Improved compliance may also come by encouraging patients to use medical insurance for eye examinations and using patient recall systems.

T1  - Homelessness and HIV risk behaviors among injection drug users.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - This article uses data from an 8-year study of injection drug users to examine whether homelessness independently influenced the likelihood of engaging in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviors. Fixed effects regression analyses are used to estimate the associations between four different housing contexts and four different behaviors related to transmitting HIV infections. Results showed that 16% of the study group experienced homelessness at some point during the study, and that homelessness was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of frequenting shooting galleries (odds ratio = 2.05), but did not have a significant effect on sharing syringes, sharing other injection drug paraphernalia, or participating in paid sex. These results provide limited support for positing homelessness as independently associated with increased levels of HIV-related risk behavior among injection drug users and highlights the need for more research that examines the housing dynamics among this population.

T1  - Size and complexity of social networks among substance abusers: childhood and current correlates.
A1  - Westermeyer, Joseph
A1  - Thuras, Paul
A1  - Waaijer, Annet
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The objective of this study was to identify parental, childhood, demographic, and social function factors associated with social network size and complexity among substance abusers using retrospective data regarding family and childhood history and current data regarding demographic characteristics and psychosocial function. The authors interviewed 505 voluntary patients with substance abuse at two university medical centers in Minnesota and Oklahoma with alcohol-drug programs located within departments of psychiatry. Data collection instruments included a childhood questionnaire, a demographic checklist, and two psychiatric rating scales of psychosocial function. The authors found that years of education, current residence with others, being actively occupied at work or school, and higher psychosocial function on two psychiatrist-rated scales were associated with increased social network size and complexity. Loss of mother, out-of-home placement, and runaway before age 18 were associated with smaller social networks in adulthood. Age, gender, and current marital status were not associated with social network. Regression analysis indicated that network size (i.e., the number of individuals in the network) was associated with higher psychosocial function over the last year but not over the last two weeks, whereas network complexity (ie, the number of subgroups in the network) was related to psychosocial function over both the last year and the last two weeks. These data indicate that in addicted persons, both childhood factors and current social factors affect network size and complexity. Network complexity may be amenable to short-term change, whereas network size may be more related to longer-term coping.

N2  - An increase in the use of cocaine and crack in several parts of Europe has raised the question whether this trend is similar to that of the USA in the 1980s. However, research in the field of cocaine use in Europe has been only sporadic. Therefore, a European multi-centre and multi-modal project was designed to study specific aspects of cocaine and crack use in Europe, in order to develop guidelines for public health strategies. Data on prevalence rates were analysed for the general population and for specific subgroups. Despite large differences between countries in the prevalence of cocaine use in the general population, most countries show an increase in the last few years. The highest rate with a lifetime prevalence of 5.2% was found for the United Kingdom, although with a plateau effect around the year 2000. With regard to specific subgroups, three groups seem to show a higher prevalence than the general population: (1) youth, especially in the party scene; (2) socially marginalized groups, such as homeless and prostitutes or those found in open drug scenes; (3) opiate-dependent patients in maintenance treatment who additionally use cocaine. Specific strategies need to be developed to address problematic cocaine use in these subgroups. Copyright 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel

N2  - AIMS AND METHODS: A comparative study of abandoned street children and formerly abandoned street children was conducted in La Paz, Bolivia, representing the first such comparative assessment. Between August and December 1997, all abandoned street children in La Paz, Bolivia, who were willing to participate (n = 124) were interviewed repeatedly at night using standardised questionnaires to collect information on family history, demographics, socioeconomics, drug use, and physical/sexual abuse. The same questionnaires were administered to all former abandoned street children who chose to enter a local orphanage (n = 35)., RESULTS: The persistent street children differed greatly from those who entered the orphanage, most markedly in their higher risk of police abuse (95% versus 38%), absence from school (84% versus 19%), engagement in robbery (26% versus 4%), paint thinner use (88% versus 41%), alcohol use (58% versus 12%), and a serious medical problem (53% versus 20%). The risks for street children increased rapidly with age., CONCLUSIONS: A cascade of adverse outcomes afflicts the vast majority of abandoned street children in La Paz, which cumulate with age and diminish the likelihood of successful rehabilitation through lasting placement in an orphanage or residential home. Informed by these findings, the investigators operate a home for abandoned street children in La Paz.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The paper reviews psychiatric epidemiological research in Germany focusing on studies conducted over the last two decades., METHOD: Relevant studies were identified using Medline and Psyndex databanks., RESULTS: Inspired mainly by Anglo-American research, a substantial body of studies demonstrates the constitution of psychiatric epidemiology as a research field in Germany. The paper reviews field studies in children and adolescents, in adults and the elderly concerning scope, design and methods. Also those studies regarding special populations (i. e. homeless, persons living in nursing homes) usually not covered by field studies were included. Selected results of current surveys were reported to illustrate that mental disorders are common., CONCLUSIONS: Future challenges of psychiatric-epidemiological research include (1) the provision of internationally comparable data and (2) the description of individual and contextual risk- and protective factors of mental disorders. The latter can only be achieved by employing longitudinal designs where researcher should adopt a multi-level perspective in questioning and analysis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Violence against women, substance use and disorder, and HIV represent three significant threats to the health of women, yet little is known about the extent of these epidemics among indigent women. This study investigates and documents differences in the prevalence and co-occurrence of physical and sexual violence, substance use and disorder, and HIV risk behavior in sizable probability samples of sheltered homeless and low-income housed women., METHODS: Retrospective self-reports were obtained through structured interviews with stratified random samples of women residing in shelters (N = 460) and low-income housing (N = 438) in Los Angeles County, California., RESULTS: Sheltered women were more likely than housed women to report experiencing physical and sexual violence, substance use and disorder, HIV risk behavior, and co-occurrence of these problems in the past year. Differences remained when propensity weights were used to equate the groups on demographic and background characteristics., CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest remarkable need for services among communities of indigent women. Higher rates of problems among women in shelters highlight the importance of differentiating among subgroups of indigent women in community-based prevention and intervention activities and tentatively suggest a protective influence of housing.

T1  - The impact of homelessness on the health of families.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Qualitative research using the symbolic interactionism framework and grounded theory methodology was employed to discover the perceived health problems and dangers that homeless families with children endure. Data were collected using semistructured interviews from 34 homeless volunteer participants with 87 children. An in-depth analysis of the data using the constant comparative method led to recurrent descriptors and patterns, which were synthesized under four themes: external locus of control, deterrents to health, economic barriers, and lack of support. The findings indicate that there is an urgent need for preventive approaches to alleviate homelessness and its attendant health problems. Recommendations consistent with current federal, state, and local strategies and plans for the early identification and prevention of homelessness are presented. School nurses have an important role as advocates, health educators, and coordinators to promote realistic strategies, programs, and policies in the delivery of services to homeless families.

T1  - Access to publicly funded methadone maintenance treatment in two western states.
A1  - Deck, Dennis
A1  - Carlson, Matthew J
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - This study examined individual and system characteristics associated with access to methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among Medicaid-eligible adults entering treatment for opiate use in Oregon and Washington. Logistic regression was used to examine the relative contributions of predisposing, need, and enabling characteristics on access to MMT. Although the number of methadone admissions increased in both states, access rates (the percentage of opiate-using adults presenting for treatment who were placed on methadone) declined after 1995. Adults in remote counties were one fifth to one tenth as likely to be placed in a methadone maintenance program than those living in counties with a methadone clinic. Other significant barriers to access included polydrug use, legal system referral, residence in a group home, lack of income, and homelessness. Factors promoting access included prior methadone use, pregnancy, and self-referral to treatment. These results suggest that more can be done to expand access to methadone maintenance.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Following a review of approaches taken to generate accurate estimates of the scale of child and youth homelessness in America, this article documents the methods and results of a multipronged count of homeless children and youth in New Haven, Connecticut. The survey used in this count accessed demographics and service needs, and was administered on the streets and in a wide range of service provision settings. A total of 170 homeless families were located, comprised primarily of young, single, African American women and their children. These families included 323 children, suggesting an annual prevalence of 1,688 in this community. This work addresses the paucity of information on homeless children and youth located in small to midsized cities

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - This study examined victim and assault characteristics and the nature and extent of coercion, violence, and physical injuries among adult male victims of sexual assaults. Client records of three groups presenting to a sexual assault care center were included: males assaulted by a stranger (n = 64), males assaulted by an acquaintance (n = 81), and females assaulted by an acquaintance (n = 106). Study results revealed that male victims of sexual assault tended to be young, single men who reported high rates of vulnerabilities such as homelessness and physical, psychiatric, and cognitive disabilities. Male stranger assailant victims were more likely to experience assaults involving weapons and physical violence. Injuries sustained by victims and services delivered at the sexual assault care center were similar for both male and female clients. The results of this study reveal new information about violence in male sexual assaults and the vulnerability of the male victims.

N2  - PURPOSE: A review of the literature about micronutrients status of Ile-de-France inhabitants., CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: During the last decades, substantial changes in the French diet had an impact on micronutrients intake. Over this time, several studies conducted in Ile-de-France showed that a large part of its inhabitants is subject to an increased risk of mild to severe deficiency in one or more micronutrient(s). Teenagers and subjects over 70 years-old are groups at risk for vitamin D deficiency. During the 1980s, iron intake was insufficient in a majority of menstruating women and iron deficiency was common during pregnancy. Vitamin C deficiency is constantly present in homeless people and often associated with an insufficient intake in a number of micronutrients., FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: Identification of the groups at risk favours a better adequacy of preventive action on micronutrient deficiencies in this population. However, the efficacy of prevention is to be determined. Controlled trials of micronutrients' supplementation may be useful to value the beneficial effects of micronutrient supplementation on the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and cancer.

T1  - Accuracy of actuarial procedures for assessment of sexual offender recidivism risk may vary across ethnicity.
A1  - Langstrom, Niklas
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Little is known about whether the accuracy of tools for assessment of sexual offender recidivism risk holds across ethnic minority offenders. I investigated the predictive validity across ethnicity for the RRASOR and the Static-99 actuarial risk assessment procedures in a national cohort of all adult male sex offenders released from prison in Sweden 1993-1997. Subjects ordered out of Sweden upon release from prison were excluded and remaining subjects (N = 1303) divided into three subgroups based on citizenship. Eighty-three percent of the subjects were of Nordic ethnicity, and non-Nordic citizens were either of non-Nordic European (n = 49, hereafter called European) or African Asian descent (n = 128). The two tools were equally accurate among Nordic and European sexual offenders for the prediction of any sexual and any violent nonsexual recidivism. In contrast, neither measure could differentiate African Asian sexual or violent recidivists from nonrecidivists. Compared to European offenders, AfricanAsian offenders had more often sexually victimized a nonrelative or stranger, had higher Static-99 scores, were younger, more often single, and more often homeless. The results require replication, but suggest that the promising predictive validity seen with some risk assessment tools may not generalize across offender ethnicity or migration status. More speculatively, different risk factors or causal chains might be involved in the development or persistence of offending among minority or immigrant sexual abusers.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The study examined experiences of mothers and health care providers with preventive child health care services using qualitative methods at a primary care clinic located in transitional housing for homeless families in an urban community with predominantly Black American residents. Participants were 20 mothers and 4 health care professionals. Three major domains emerged: (a). the infrastructure of the clinic and health care delivery poses barriers to mothers' access and use of services for their children; (b). specialized, biomedical-driven care produces fragmented care delivery not responsive to the comprehensive nature of problems of mothers and their children; and (c). organizational strategies for improving access and use of health care services are directed by health care providers' value orientations. Findings support existence of infrastructural characteristics of the health care system that maintains differential value orientations and power structure, and care delivery processes that are non responsive to racially diverse and poor mothers.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the interaction of temperament and environment and how these impact on the psychological function of street children and non-street children in Eldoret Kenya., METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Eldoret town. A Revised Dimensions of Temperament Survey (DOTS-R) a 54 item, factor-analytically-developed self-report instrument that measures nine temperament dimensions was used., RESULTS: The statistical analysis showed that the largest significant level was on the approach/withdrawal dimension (F = 12.38, p<.001) the activity level-sleep (F = 4.20, p<.01) and the task orientation (F = 3.62, p<.01) dimensions were next in rank in terms of significance. The highest mean score on activity level-general (17.88) and the activity level-sleep (9.65) were in the "of" the street children that is consistent with their scavenging lifestyle and sleeping patterns. They have to be vigilant when sleeping on shop verandas, run down buildings, and trash-bins., CONCLUSION: These results support earlier research on street children. Counter to public opinion and hostility, the children are resilient, adaptable and flexibile in the face of adversity and remaining well adjusted as individuals.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether published subtypes of attachment disorder can be reliably identified by trained clinicians reviewing data from high-risk populations and to investigate the relationship between disorder classification and standardized measures of attachment behavior., METHOD: Twenty or more children aged 18 to 48 months and their primary caregivers were recruited from three sites: a treatment team for maltreated young children (n = 20), a homeless shelter (n = 25), and Head Start centers (n = 24). All dyads completed a semistructured clinical assessment and laboratory and home-based attachment measures., RESULTS: All but one type of attachment disorder could be identified reliably by clinician raters (kappa range = 0.62-0.74, depending on subtype). Children from the maltreatment sample were significantly more likely to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups (p <.001). As predicted, children without an attachment disorder were more likely to be classified as securely attached than those with an attachment disorder (p =.03); however, children classified as having disorganized attachment were not more likely to receive an attachment disorder diagnosis., CONCLUSIONS: Attachment disorders can be reliably diagnosed in young children, though research on refining disorder criteria should precede intervention trials.

N2  - This article examines whether female injection drug users (IDUs) who have a history of using mental health services (i.e., one or more psychiatric hospitalizations or counseling) enter types of drug treatment different from those of female IDUs who do not have a history of using mental health services. Data used for this exploration originate from a statewide drug-treatment database covering all women who entered drug treatment in the state of Massachusetts from 1996 to 2001. A total of 7776 women were included in the study. Through the use of logistic regression analysis, the study determined that those female IDUs who had a mental health service history, compared with female IDUs who had no such history, were about two-thirds more likely to enter substance abuse treatment other than detoxification only. Specifically, women with a mental health service history were about 66% more likely to enter substance abuse treatment modalities such as drug-free outpatient counseling, methadone maintenance, and/or long-term residential services rather than detoxification alone. This is a positive result, indicating that female IDUs who have mental health problems and therefore have high needs for effective substance abuse treatment are entering the more intensive and/or longer term modalities likely to lead to better outcomes. Possible factors accounting for this, including the referral process within detoxification centers, the role of community referral agents, and the experience women gain as a consequence of receiving services in more than one service system, are discussed.

N2  - We report findings from a community-based two-city survey of homeless adults comparing the level of substance abuse treatment assigned to them using the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria with care actually received during the previous 12 months. Overall 531 adults were surveyed with 382 meeting DSM-IIIR criteria of being in need of treatment or having a demand for treatment. Of those with a treatment need, 1.5% met criteria for outpatient care, 40.3% intensive outpatient/partial hospitalization care, 29.8% medically monitored care and 28.8% managed care levels. In contrast, of those receiving treatment (50.5%, 162 persons), almost all care received by this cohort was either inpatient or residential based (83.6%). Unsheltered homeless persons and those without insurance were significantly more likely to report not receiving needed treatment. Lack of treatment availability or capacity, expense, and changing one's mind while on a wait list were the most commonly cited reasons for no treatment.

T1  - Providing better opportunities for older children in the child welfare system.
A1  - Massinga, Ruth
A1  - Pecora, Peter J
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - A growing number of children over age 10 reside in and emancipate from foster care every year. Older children face many of the same challenges as younger children, but they also have unique developmental needs. This article discusses older children in the child welfare system and finds: Approximately 47% of children in foster care are over age 11, and in 2001, 20% of children leaving foster care were over age 16. Older children need permanency, stability, and a "forever family." Maintaining connections with siblings and other kin can be a crucial resource for older children as they transition to independence. Former foster children are at higher risk for a number of negative outcomes, such as substance abuse, homelessness, and low educational attainment, but the research on older youth is limited and often does not consider the strengths these youth exhibit. Much can be done to better serve older children while they are in care and to provide them with better opportunities as they transition out of the system. Programs that draw on community resources, promote a system of care, link children to mentors, and teach them life skills hold promise for improving the lives of these children.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We examined the longitudinal effects of a Housing First program for homeless, mentally ill individuals' on those individuals' consumer choice, housing stability, substance use, treatment utilization, and psychiatric symptoms., METHODS: Two hundred twenty-five participants were randomly assigned to receive housing contingent on treatment and sobriety (control) or to receive immediate housing without treatment prerequisites (experimental). Interviews were conducted every 6 months for 24 months., RESULTS: The experimental group obtained housing earlier, remained stably housed, and reported higher perceived choice. Utilization of substance abuse treatment was significantly higher for the control group, but no differences were found in substance use or psychiatric symptoms., CONCLUSIONS: Participants in the Housing First program were able to obtain and maintain independent housing without compromising psychiatric or substance abuse symptoms.

T1  - The social distribution of reports of health-related concerns among adolescents in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
A1  - de Moura, S L
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - This study investigated the health-related concerns of adolescents living on streets as compared to poor and privileged adolescents living with their families in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The different groups of respondents were similar in terms of individuals' fear of disease and lack of concern about health in old age. AIDS and cancer were feared by most of the respondents in the different groups, particularly because of their severity and people's vulnerability to these conditions. Health in old age was not a major concern in any of the study groups. It is suggested that health educators take into account the wide range of concerns among adolescents on the streets in order to design interventions that cater for different levels of interest and motivation. It is also argued that there is a need for health education in order to clarify misperceptions about disease transmission, prevention and treatment among adolescents from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

T1  - Children attending addiction treatment services in Dublin, 1990-1999.
A1  - Smyth, Bobby P

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - In Europe, adolescent substance misuse increased during the 1990s. Ireland has among the highest rates of substance misuse among schoolchildren in Europe. We sought to describe the socio-demographic and drug misuse profile of children presenting to addiction treatment services in Dublin during the 1990s. Of the 9,874 individuals who sought addiction treatment, 1,953 (20%) were aged less than 18 years. There was a sharp increase in the number of children after 1993. The main drug of abuse was an opiate in 48% of cases. Compared to adults, the children were more likely to be female and less likely to inject. As the decade progressed the proportion of girls increased, injecting was reported more frequently and there was a dramatic rise in heroin misuse. Child heroin users were more likely to be female and to be homeless compared to their adult counterparts. This study highlights the need for a dedicated service for child drug users in Dublin.

T1  - Suicide, high-risk behaviors, and coping style in homeless adolescent males' adjustment.
A1  - Votta, Elizabeth

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the association among suicide behaviors, high-risk behaviors, coping style, and psychological adjustment (i.e., depressive symptomatology, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems) in homeless and non-homeless adolescent males (aged 16 to 19 years)., METHODS: Data were obtained from 100 homeless youth accessing an emergency shelter (Ottawa, ON). The comparison group was comprised of 70 youth accessing local community drop-in centers that lived with their parent(s)/guardian(s) and had never stayed in a shelter. Data were analyzed using Chi-square, Student's t-tests, and regression statistics., RESULTS: Relative to non-homeless youth, homeless youth were more likely to report drug, alcohol, and tobacco use, legal problems, academic difficulties, and mental health problems. Homeless youth presented with a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation, past suicide attempts, depressive symptomatology, and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Disengagement coping was a predictor of suicidal ideation, past attempts, depressive symptoms and both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in homeless youth., CONCLUSIONS: Relative to non-homeless youth, findings indicate that homeless youth reported greater use of a disengaging coping style and are at greater risk for high-risk behaviors, past suicide attempts, and clinically elevated levels of depressive symptoms and behavior problems.

N2  - Little is known about the similarities and differences between civilian and military child maltreatment cases and no recent study has compared them directly. Understanding the nature of the problems in each could lead to identifying strengths and weaknesses for the development of more helpful prevention and treatment programs. The overall rates of child maltreatment in the U.S. civilian population (14.7 to 11.8 per 1,000) were about double the Army rates (7.6 to 6.0 per 1,000) from 1995 to 1999. These differences were largely because of the higher rate of neglect in the U.S. data--about three times that of the Army--and may be because of factors that are largely controlled in the Army such as poverty, severe substance abuse, homelessness, and other social variables. For 1999 only, we examined the type of maltreatment by age and sex, the victim rates by race/ethnicity, and the relationship of perpetrator to victim.

N2  - The objective of the present study was to determine whether provision of health advocacy for homeless patients would reduce the burden of care for a primary healthcare team. The impact of a health advocacy intervention was assessed in a quasi-experimental, three-armed controlled trial. Homeless patients registering at an inner-city health centre were allocated in alternating periods to health advocacy (with or without outreach registration) or 'usual care' over a total intake period of 3 years. The client group were homeless people in hostels or other temporary accommodation in the Liverpool 8 area of the UK. The majority of participants (n = 400) were women (76%) in their twenties (mean age = 26.6 years). Most (63%) were temporarily housed at either one of the women's refuges or Liverpool City Council family hostels, and all were registered with an inner-city health centre. Data on health service utilisation over a 3-month period was collected for all clients recruited to the study and direct health service costs were measured. Homeless adults who were proactively registered by the health advocate on outreach visits to hostels made significantly less use of health centre resources whilst having more contact with the health advocate than patients who registered at the health centre at a time of need. There was no reduction in health centre workload when the offer of health advocacy was made after registration at the health centre. The additional costs of providing health advocacy were offset by a reduction in demand for health-centre-based care. The results demonstrate that health advocacy can alter the pattern of help-seeking by temporarily homeless adults. The intervention was cost-neutral. The short-term health service workload associated with symptomatic homeless patients requiring medication was not reduced, but outreach health advocacy was used successfully to address psycho-social issues and reduce the workload for primary care staff.

A1  - Dostaler, Theresa
A1  - Nelson, Geoffrey
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - To evaluate the processes and outcomes of a short-term shelter, both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered via participant observation, focus group interviews with shelter staff and residents, and individual interviews with a sample of 40 young women who had been homeless prior to using the shelter. The process evaluation showed that the shelter staff strived to utilize an empowerment philosophy in their relationships with residents, but that there were many challenges to implementing this philosophy. The outcome evaluation showed that, at a 3-month follow-up, the participants reported significant improvements in housing, income, independence, and life satisfaction, but most continued to experience poverty and a number of other difficulties. The results were discussed in terms of the implications for future research and the valueand limitations of shelters for dealing with homeless youth. The need for more sustained and comprehensive program interventions and supportive social policies was underscored.

N2  - In response to the Surgeon General's request for more research on racial disparities in mental health care, especially research that includes high-need populations (e.g., the homeless, incarcerated, children in foster care, and substance abusers), we examined racial disparities in the provision of mental health counseling, psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy in hospital outpatient settings using nationally representative data from the 1997 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). After controlling for diagnosis and other factors, we found that African Americans were less likely than whites to receive mental health counseling and psychotherapy, but more likely than whites to receive pharmacotherapy. We also found that substance abuse clinics were more likely than primary care and specialty mental health clinics to provide mental health counseling and psychotherapy. However, specialty mental health clinics were the only clinics to provide pharmacotherapy. Future research should examine racial disparities in a variety of settings, controlling for diagnosis as well as other factors.

N2  - Slovenia is a small Central European country with a population of 1.99 million and an incidence of tuberculosis (TB) of 18.6 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2001. In a prospective nation-wide, 1-y DNA fingerprinting study, the genetic diversity of 99.7% of all Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates obtained from Slovenian patients with culture-verified TB in 2001 were assessed using a standardized IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. Among 306 M. tuberculosis isolates, 228 different IS6110 RFLP patterns were found. The number of IS6110 copies varied from 2 to 16 (9.2 copies per isolate on average). Only 2 isolates (0.7%) with less than 5 IS6110 copies were identified. Clustered M. tuberculosis isolates were detected in 116 (37.9%) patients. The degree of recent transmission in the 1-y period was 25%. The clustering rate decreased with age from 46.4% (age group under 35 y) to 19.5% (age group above 65 y). A history of alcohol abuse and homelessness was found to be associated with clustering of TB cases. In conclusion, a high clustering frequency was identified among Slovenian TB patients. The study increased our understanding of important risk factors and routes of TB transmission in Slovenia.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and possible suicide attempts and ideation predictors in the school population of girls and boys in the city of Lodz., METHOD: A self-administered anonymous questionnaire was distributed to a representative (random) sample of 1663 students, aged 14-21. Boys and girls reporting no suicidal behaviour (NSB) constitute the control groups; the characteristics of these groups were compared to those of the groups with suicidal behaviour (SB), with focus on the associations between different variables and gender, separately for suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA)., RESULTS: About 37% of girls and 25% of boys reported suicidal ideation and about 11% and 5%, respectively, suicide attempts. Boys were more likely to make multiple suicide attempts. The relation between SB and the history of psychiatric treatment was the same for both sexes. Boys with SB were significantly more often fascinated with death, and girls were significantly more often exposed to difficult family situations.

N2  - AIMS: To evaluate the associations between methadone and high-dose buprenorphine maintenance treatment and illicit drug use and injection among drug users in France., DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. Data were gathered using a questionnaire administered containing closed-ended questions., SETTING: Drug dependence clinics (DDC) and general practitioners' (GPs) offices in three French cities., PARTICIPANTS: Drug users undergoing maintenance treatment with methadone (n = 197) and buprenorphine (n = 142)., MEASUREMENTS: Interviews covered the use of illicit drugs (heroin, cocaine or crack) and injection practices (illicit drugs and/or substitution drugs) during the last month, current treatment modalities, socio-demographic and health characteristics. Bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regressions were conducted., FINDINGS: Overall, 35.4% of respondents (34.5% in the methadone group, 36.6% in the buprenorphine group, P= 0.69) had used at least one illicit drug, 25.7% reported having injected drugs and 15.3% had injected the substitution drug. Injection was more common among buprenorphine-maintained individuals (40.1%) than among users on methadone (15.2%) (P < 0.01). Multivariate analyses indicate that the type of substitution drug (buprenorphine versus methadone) was not associated with illicit drug use (OR = 1.1; 95% CI = 0.7-1.8). In the buprenorphine group, injection was related independently to social situation, as measured by housing (unstable versus stable housing, OR = 4.3; 95% CI = 1.6-11.5), but this was not the case in the methadone group. The risk of injection increased with buprenorphine dosage (high/low dosage OR = 6.2; 95% CI = 2.0-19.7), but this association was not observed in the methadone group., CONCLUSION: Further studies comparing the benefits of these two types of treatment should be carried out, taking outcomes such as physical health, mental health and social functioning into consideration.

N2  - Previous findings of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in human semen have been inconsistent. This study attempted to elucidate the presence of HCV in semen from 80 HCV RNA blood plasma positive homeless men using two novel non-PCR based techniques. Semen was frozen immediately upon ejaculation in order to preserve virus quantity. This study demonstrated that 36% of the study population had HCV in semen. Bayer's Versant HCV RNA Qualitative Assay (Bayer Diagnostics, Emeryville, CA) based on transcription mediated amplification (TMA) assay detected 29 positive semen samples and Versant HCV RNA 3.0 Assay (bDNA) (Bayer Diagnostics, Emeryville, CA) detected only six. This demonstrated that TMA was more sensitive than the bDNA in detecting HCV in semen (P<0.002). HCV blood plasma viral load was positively correlated with the presence of HCV in semen (Spearman's Rho=0.40, P<0.0002), while the presence of leukocytes in semen was not (Spearman's Rho=0.19, P<0.12). This supports the hypothesis that HCV is "leaked out" from the peripheral circulation into semen. Three semen samples had a viral load of >5000 IU/mL. The presence of a high viral load in semen in certain men suggests that sexual transmission of the virus is possible. Laboratory capability to accurately detect HCV positive semen is an important step in establishing the risk of sexual transmission and in identifying strategies for protecting uninfected partners.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Homeless persons experience high rates of sexual and physical assault; homeless women are thought to be at highest risk. To determine the prevalence, distribution, and factors associated with sexual and physical assault, we surveyed homeless and marginally housed adults in San Francisco, Calif., METHODS: We interviewed 2577 respondents about their history of recent sexual and physical assault, housing history, sexual practices, substance use, health status, and criminal justice history. The main outcome measures were self-reported sexual and physical assault in the previous 12 months., RESULTS: Overall, 32.3% of women, 27.1% of men, and 38.1% of transgendered persons reported a history of either sexual or physical assault in the previous year; 9.4% of women, 1.4% of men, and 11.9% of transgendered persons reported sexual assault, and 30.6% of women, 26.6% of men, and 33.3% of transgendered persons reported physical assault. In multivariate models, being homeless (as opposed to marginally housed) was associated with sexual assault for women, but not for men (adjusted odds ratio for homeless women, 3.4 [1.2-9.7]). Housing status was not associated with physical assault for women or men. Mental illness and sex work were both common and associated with high rates of assault in multivariate analyses., CONCLUSIONS: Sexual and physical assault are common experiences for homeless and marginally housed persons. Housing is associated with lower rates of sexual assault among women. Strategies to decrease sexual and physical assault and its consequences are needed in this population.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Patient satisfaction is a key quality of care indicator for which little is known for the homeless women population. We hypothesized that homeless women who last visited homeless-focused healthcare sites (shelter/outreach clinics and mobile vans) will have higher satisfaction ratings than homeless women who last visited county/government clinics. This association was also tested using the Gelberg-Andersen Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations., METHODS: Data were gathered on 974 homeless women aged 15-44 in a probability cluster sample of 60 shelters and 18 meal programs in Los Angeles County. The homeless women participated in 45-minute interviews., RESULTS: Our hypothesis was partially supported, as shelter and outreach clinics were positively and significantly associated with greater quality satisfaction (beta = 10.2, p < 0.001). Healthcare at private doctors' offices was also associated with quality, access, and appointment satisfaction when compared with care received at county/government clinics (beta = 15.9, p < 0.001; beta = 8.6, p < 0.05; beta = 16.3, p < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Policymakers should encourage healthcare sites that serve homeless women to improve their care by learning from shelter/outreach clinics and private doctors.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between cumulative environmental risks and early intervention, parenting attitudes, potential for child abuse and child development in substance abusing mothers., METHOD: We studied 161 substance-abusing women, from a randomized longitudinal study of a home based early intervention, who had custody of their children through 18 months. The intervention group received weekly home visits in the first 6 months and biweekly visits from 6 to 18 months. Parenting stress and child abuse potential were assessed at 6 and 18 months postpartum. Children's mental and motor development (Bayley MDI and PDI) and language development (REEL) were assessed at 6, 12, and 18 months postpartum. Ten maternal risk factors were assessed: maternal depression, domestic violence, nondomestic violence, family size, incarceration, no significant other in home, negative life events, psychiatric problems, homelessness, and severity of drug use. Level of risk was recoded into four categories (2 or less, 3, 4, and 5 or more), which had adequate cell sizes for repeated measures analysis., DATA ANALYSIS: Repeated measures analyses were run to examine how level of risk and group (intervention or control) were related to parenting stress, child abuse potential, and children's mental, motor and language development over time., RESULTS: Parenting stress and child abuse potential were higher for women with five risks or more compared with women who had four or fewer risks; children's mental, motor, and language development were not related to level of risk. Children in the intervention group had significantly higher scores on the PDI at 6 and 18 months (107.4 vs. 103.6 and 101.1 vs. 97.2) and had marginally better scores on the MDI at 6 and 12 months (107.7 vs. 104.2 and 103.6 vs. 100.1), compared to the control group., CONCLUSION: Compared to drug-abusing women with fewer than five risks, women with five or more risks found parenting more stressful and indicated greater inclination towards abusive and neglectful behavior, placing their infants at increased risk for poor parenting, abuse and neglect. Early home-based intervention in high-risk families may be beneficial to infant development.

N2  - Runaway youth are 6-12 times more likely to become infected with HIV than other youth. Using a quasi-experimental design, the efficacy of an HIV prevention program was evaluated over 2 years among 2 groups of runaways: (1) those at 2 shelters who received Street Smart, an intensive HIV intervention program, and (2) youth at 2 control shelters. Street Smart provided youth with access to health care and condoms and delivered a 10-session skill-focused prevention program based on social learning theory to youth. Prior to analysis of the intervention's outcomes, propensity scores were used to identify comparable subgroups of youth in the intervention (n = 101) and control conditions (n = 86). Compared to females in the control condition, females in the intervention condition significantly reduced their unprotected sexual acts at 2 years and alcohol use, marijuana use, and the number of drugs used over 12 months. Male adolescents in the intervention condition showed significant reductions in marijuana use over 6 months compared to control youth. Adolescent HIV prevention programs must proactively identify mechanisms for maintaining behavior change over the long-term, and innovative research designs are needed to allow examination of agency-level interventions.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The nature of continuous exposure to the street and its associated lifestyles make street children vulnerable to the use of psychoactive substances. At present, there is insufficient information regarding the pattern of psychoactive substance use among this group of children in Nigeria., AIMS: To determine the pattern of psychoactive substance use among street children and to explore those socio-demographic and street factors that could be related to current psychoactive substance use., METHODS: Using a multistage sampling method in a local government area in Nigeria, 180 children aged 18 years and below who had left the custody of their parents for a period of not less than a month were interviewed., RESULTS: The most commonly used psychoactive substances were alcohol, kolanut, tobacco and cannabis. None of the respondents reported the use of cocaine, opiates or hallucinogens. Length of stay on the street was found to be significantly predictive of current psychoactive substance use., CONCLUSION: The readily available and relatively cheap substances were in common use among street children with the length of stay on the street being a significant predictive factor. The affected community and the government should design methods of curtailing the problem of drug use and helping the children off the street.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A quarter of US children are at increased risk of obesity-related health problems because of excess weight. The few national studies of child overweight and inadequate household resources available to purchase healthy foods, or food insecurity, have shown inconsistent results. We hypothesized that the inconsistency in these results may be attributed to a differential effect of participation in food assistance programs in food secure and food insecure households., METHODS: Using the 1997 Panel Study of Income Dynamics Child Development Supplement, we compared the risk of a child aged 5 to 12 years being at or above the 85th percentile of body mass index for age in food insecure and food secure, low-income households when controlling for participation in the Food Stamp Program and the national school lunch and breakfast programs as well as other covariates., RESULTS: We found that food insecure girls who participated in all 3 programs had a 68% reduced odds (odds ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.77) of being at risk of overweight when compared with food insecure girls in nonparticipating households and controlling for other factors. Girls in food secure households generally had no greater or less risk of overweight if they participated in any or all programs. Boys in both food insecure and food secure households had no greater or less risk of overweight by if they participated in any or all of the programs., CONCLUSIONS: These results support our hypothesis that food assistance programs play a protective role for low-income children's health, particularly in girls in food insecure households.

N2  - The use of drugs in the African American community, particularly crack cocaine, has been linked to sexual risk-taking behavior, which increases the likelihood that persons will become infected with Human Immuno Virus. In order to more fully understand risk-taking behavior and to target interventions among African American men and women, this study used data collected from 1277 individuals residing in Lexington and Louisville, Kentucky, who were recruited into National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Cooperative Agreement Project from 1993 to 1998. The study compared African Americans treated for Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (n = 292) with African Americans who reported never being treated for a STD (n = 504) with regard to HIV information, awareness, and the number of HIV tests between those with and without STD exposure. Additionally, we examine gender differences among African Americans who have and have not been exposed to STDs on risk behaviors and HIV knowledge, awareness, and testing. It was hypothesized that African American drug users in the STD group would engage in more risk behaviors than those who reported no STDs. Results indicated that individuals in both groups, the STD exposure group and the no STD group, engaged in similar HIV-risky behaviors. However, the STD group used a greater number of different drugs in their lifetime. The STD group reported they were more likely to get HIV and were more frequently tested for HIV. Females with an STD history were more likely to have been in drug user treatment and to perceive themselves as homeless. Both males and females in the STD group were more likely to report involvement in exchanging sex.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate mortality among users of hostels for homeless people in Copenhagen, and to identify predictors of death such as conditions during upbringing, mental illness, and misuse of alcohol and drugs., DESIGN: Register based follow up study., SETTING: Two hostels for homeless people in Copenhagen, Denmark, PARTICIPANTS: 579 people who stayed in one hostel in Copenhagen in 1991, and a representative sample of 185 people who stayed in the original hostel and one other in Copenhagen., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cause specific mortality., RESULTS: The age and sex standardised mortality ratio for both sexes was 3.8 (95% confidence interval 3.5 to 4.1); 2.8 (2.6 to 3.1) for men and 5.6 (4.3 to 6.9) for women. The age and sex standardised mortality ratio for suicide for both sexes was 6.0 (3.9 to 8.1), for death from natural causes 2.6 (2.3 to 2.9), for unintentional injuries 14.6 (11.4 to 17.8), and for unknown cause of death 62.9 (52.7 to 73.2). Mortality was comparatively higher in the younger age groups. It was also significantly higher among homeless people who had stayed in a hostel more than once and stayed fewer than 11 days, compared with the rest of the study group. Risk factors for early death were premature death of the father and misuse of alcohol and sedatives., CONCLUSION: Homeless people staying in hostels, particularly young women, are more likely to die early than the general population. Other predictors of early death include adverse experiences in childhood, such as death of the father, and misuse of alcohol and sedatives.

N2  - The aim of this prospective study was to describe and quantify EEG patterns in 10 very premature infants (24 weeks 2 days- 26 weeks 4 days GA) without neonatal neurological pathology and with a normal outcome at 3 years of age for nine of them. EEG and eye movements were recorded in the first 5 days of life. All tracings were discontinuous; EEG inactivity (<15 microV) never exceeded 1 min, representing 45.3% of total recording time. The EEG bursts, mainly synchronous, could last up to 83 s when >50 microV and to 197 s when >15 microV. High voltage delta waves (0.5 Hz; up to 330 microV), either smooth or superimposed with 7-12 Hz rhythms, were the most typical and frequent figures, mainly in temporal (mean number 257.2 +/- 73.3) and occipital (237.7 +/- 65.8 per hour recording) areas. In temporal areas, they appeared mainly in clusters; more often unilateral than bilateral (P < 0.05). Occipital delta waves were as often bilateral and synchronous as unilateral. The two distinct frontal delta waves were significantly less numerous than other delta waves (P < 0.05). Bursts of hypersynchronous high voltage delta waves and of diffuse sharp theta waves were less numerous than other waves (P < 0.01). Considering periods with or without eye movements, the mean percentage and the mean longest period of EEG activity (< or =50 microV) were significantly greater (P < 0.01) when eye movements were present, indicating a rough sleep state differentiation as early as 25 weeks CA. These EEG patterns are qualitatively and quantitatively reproducible. They constitute standards of normality and a basis for the determination of neurological prognosis.

N2  - This study utilized data from the national ACCESS program (N = 7224) to investigate the prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in a sample of homeless people with mental illness. The prevalence of suicidal ideation in this sample was high (66.2% lifetime prevalence). In addition, 51.3% of the sample reported that they had ever attempted suicide, 26.9% reported an attempt that resulted in a nonpsychiatric hospitalization, and 8% reported an attempt in the previous 30 days. Youth, substance abuse, and psychiatric symptoms were all significantly associated with suicide attempts. Those who reported a recent attempt also reported higher rates of mental health care utilization, particularly inpatient care. The authors conclude that homeless people with mental illness are at particularly high risk for suicidal behavior, however, only in part because of the high prevalence of traditional risk factors.

T1  - Factors in the psychological adjustment of homeless adolescent males: the role of coping style.
A1  - Votta, Elizabeth

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional study explored differences in and the association of self-reported coping style, negative life events, self-esteem, and perceived social support with the psychological adjustment (i.e., depressive symptoms, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems) of homeless and nonhomeless adolescent males., METHOD: Data were collected from 100 youths accessing an emergency shelter and two comparison groups of nonhomeless youths: 70 youths accessing local community drop-in centers and 54 high school youths who had never accessed a shelter or drop-in. Data were collected from January 2000 to January 2001 in Ottawa., RESULTS: Homeless youths reported a higher prevalence of family dysfunction, school difficulties, suicide attempts, legal problems, and substance use than nonhomeless youths. Homeless youths differed from nonhomeless youths for each outcome measure, reporting a greater use of the disengagement coping style, higher negative life events index, less perceived parental support, and higher levels of depressive symptoms and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that disengagement coping and self-worth accounted for significant amounts of variance in depressive symptomatology, and both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in homeless youths., CONCLUSIONS: Findings reflect the merit of considering coping style as a factor in the prevalence of psychological maladjustment among homeless youths.

T1  - Access to health care for youth leaving foster care: Medicaid and SCHIP.
A1  - English, Abigail
A1  - Morreale, Madlyn C

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - PURPOSE: To examine how Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) could improve health care access for youth aging out of foster care, a vulnerable population with multiple health concerns., METHODS: On the basis of an analysis of state and federal laws, state plans and amendments, and a telephone survey of state officials, this article identifies options in Medicaid and SCHIP for states to provide health insurance coverage for these youth, examines states' use of available options, and highlights other relevant federal health care programs., RESULTS: Numerous Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility categories could provide coverage for older adolescents leaving foster care. The federal Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 (FCIA) created a new Medicaid expansion option for this group and other opportunities for states to address their health care needs. Numerous other federal programs also finance health care that could serve this population., CONCLUSIONS: The potential exists through Medicaid or SCHIP to ensure that nearly all former foster youth have health insurance as they leave state custody, but Medicaid and SCHIP cannot alone meet all health care needs of these youth. Financing available through other public programs is essential. A few states have adopted the new FCIA Medicaid expansion option for former foster youth, and a larger number have implemented other relevant Medicaid options. Additional states have used other innovative approaches to facilitate health care access. Most states could do much more. A major challenge is to find approaches that can be implemented during times of severe budgetary limitations.

A1  - Stax, Tobias Borner
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Based on a longitudinal study of approximately 1000 homeless people who used shelters or similar institutions in 1988-89, an estimate was made of the rate of people using illegal drugs in that population. This estimation was made possible by combining information from different registers-criminal records, enrollments at drug user treatment centers, and registers indicating cause of death. The samples use of drugs is also noted. The implications of these findings are discussed in the light of Denmark's current policy towards people using illegal drugs and using shelters.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Our research pertains to juveniles coming under the responsibility of the Centres jeunesse du Quebec (delinquency and youth protection regional services). Some of these teenagers fled their family and made use of their social network to cope with residential instability. These youths were then in a situation of "hidden homelessness", sleeping neither in the streets nor at shelters. Two objectives are pursued: 1) a comparison of youth's and parent's evaluations of significant dimensions of their family life, and 2) an identification of the adolescents' characteristics (clinical, familial and individual) related to their "hidden homelessness"., METHOD: Using bivariate analysis, a group of adolescents who had experienced homelessness was paired (on sex, age and urban or rural areas of origin) to a sample of non-homeless youths. The analysis uses both adolescents and parent/caretaker reports on measures of family characteristics and adolescent self-reports on measures of clinical and personal characteristics., FINDINGS: Our results show 1) that, in general, adolescents report a higher level of parental maltreatment and more problems related to the family dynamics and their relationship with their parents than their parents do; 2) that hidden homelessness of distressed youths is generally associated with the same familial risk factors as the ones identified by the studies concerning street youths; 3) in contrast to some other comparative studies, the homeless adolescents in our study did not differ from the non-homeless youths as to the importance of the depressive diagnostic and the use of hard drugs.

N2  - A probability sample of Californian homeless females was examined for health service utilization, comparing adolescents to older women. Adolescent homeless women reported higher outpatient visit use. Possessing public health insurance increased the odds of outpatient visits. Future research might use the outpatient setting to aid adolescents in exiting homelessness.

N2  - This study examined differences in contextual factors, substance use, sexual risk behaviors, and comorbid histories between African-American, out-of-treatment, crack-abusing women who had either a single sexual partner or multiple partners. Bivariate analysis indicated that women with multiple partners were more likely than women with a single partner to be homeless, financially dependent, and to have histories of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. Women with multiple partners reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, and more symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In multiple logistic regression analysis, being unemployed, difficult childhood, and number of days of crack use in the previous 30 days, longer crack runs, and more frequent unprotected fellatio were associated with increased odds of having multiple sexual partners. Being married or living as married was associated with decreased odds of having multiple sexual partners. The importance of assessing contextual and historical factors and implications for future research is discussed.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - The comparative salience of attitudes, normative influences, and perceptions of the ease or difficulty of engaging in marijuana use was examined in 91 adolescents from three subsamples: those living in Nimbin, Australia, where marijuana use appears to have become normalized, a control group, and a group of homeless adolescents, surveyed in 1997. There were no differences between two of the groups in relation to their attitudes towards marijuana, and no differences in perceived access to the drug. For those who intended using marijuana, personal beliefs were significantly more salient than beliefs about what important others thought they should do.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - This study examined factors associated with the use of the Health Care for the Homeless Program and other health care services by homeless adults. A total of 941 homeless adults were identified in 52 soup kitchens in U.S. communities. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were applied. Among homeless adults, having dental problems was the most robust factor associated with their use of Health Care for the Homeless Program services (odds ratio [OR] = 2.50, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.44-4.32). Among homeless adults who did not visit Health Care for the Homeless Program services during last six months, the number of emergency room visits was the most powerful factor associated with their use of other health care services (OR = 1.15, 95 percent CI = 1.05-1.26). The results of the study can help health care providers better serve homeless adults to meet their health needs.

N2  - Using data collected by Project Renewal's mobile medical services to homeless people in New York City, this paper discusses a tension between an emergency medicine model of outreach and that of primary care. In the former model, clinicians evaluate clients on the basis of presenting complaints and refer them, as necessary, for specialized treatment. The latter is a broader model of comprehensive outreach and/or treatment, where clinicians screen clients and assess them for various conditions offering ongoing evaluation and treatment on site. The model of outreach is applicable for some homeless clients, but the prevalence and overlap of physical complaints, infectious diseases, substance abuse, and psychiatric symptoms among homeless people in New York City has resulted in an evolution toward broader approaches to outreach in this population. Improvements in diagnostic testing and increasingly portable medical technology may make the mobile delivery of medical care to homeless persons increasingly feasible.

N2  - Female injection drug users (IDUs) represent a large proportion of persons infected with HIV in the United States, and women who inject drugs have a high incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Therefore, it is important to understand the role of gender in injection risk behavior and the transmission of blood-borne virus. In 2000-2002, 844 young (<30 years old) IDUs were surveyed in San Francisco. We compared self-reported risk behavior between 584 males and 260 female participants from cross-sectional baseline data. We used logistic regression to determine whether demographic, structural, and relationship variables explained increased needle borrowing, drug preparation equipment sharing, and being injected by another IDU among females compared to males. Females were significantly younger than males and were more likely to engage in needle borrowing, ancillary equipment sharing, and being injected by someone else. Females were more likely than males to report recent sexual intercourse and to have IDU sex partners. Females and males were not different with respect to education, race/ethnicity, or housing status. In logistic regression models for borrowing a used needle and sharing drug preparation equipment, increased risk in females was explained by having an injection partner who was also a sexual partner. Injecting risk was greater in the young female compared to male IDUs despite equivalent frequency of injecting. Overlapping sexual and injection partnerships were a key factor in explaining increased injection risk in females. Females were more likely to be injected by another IDU even after adjusting for years injecting, being in a relationship with another IDU, and other potential confounders. Interventions to reduce sexual and injection practices that put women at risk of contracting hepatitis and HIV are needed.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to describe endorsement rates of substance use criteria among homeless adolescents and to evaluate the reliability of diagnostic formulations among a group of adolescents who use more frequently and more heavily than other samples of adolescents., METHOD: Substance use rates and DSM-IV abuse and dependence criteria were assessed among 198 (109 male) homeless youths between the ages of 13 and 19, as part of a larger study. Endorsement rates and reliability analyses were completed for diagnostic criteria assessed for alcohol, marijuana, amphetamines and heroin., RESULTS: Consistent with other studies of homeless youth, data revealed high rates of substance use and high rates of substance dependence. Both dependence and abuse diagnoses were associated with greater rates of use. DSM-IV criteria showed acceptable internal reliability, although variability was observed when applied to different substances. Of the drugs assessed, problems with heroin use appeared to be best, and marijuana use least, represented by dependence criteria. Criteria pertaining to continued use despite interference with role obligations and the experience of craving were consistently related to other dependence criteria., CONCLUSIONS: DSM-IV substance dependence criteria appear to have good internal reliability within a sample of adolescents who use at extremely high rates. Continued development of diagnostic systems for adolescent substance use should consider the social context of use, differential patterns of symptoms across different substances and the inclusion of additional criteria found reliable among adolescent samples.

N2  - Street children are a high priority for health policy and service planning in Kenya. Poverty, wars, famine and disease have resulted in street children having a persistent presence in African cities and towns. The Maastricht Social Network Analysis (MSNA) was implemented as the core instrument in a battery to measure the health status of the street children. Owing to the absence of census data of street children in Kenya and the difficulty in tracking this mobile population, we implemented a mixed snowball and convenience sampling design to recruit research subjects. Three hundred street and orphanage children, and 100 primary school children as a control group, were included in the study. The MSNA provided a social diagnosis that complements the clinical diagnosis of the health status of the sample. Only one main methodological question is presented: is the MSNA applicable to describe the personal social networks of (1). children and of (2). people living in a Kenyan culture? Qualitative field observations, key informant interviews and focus groups inform the adaptation of the MSNA instrument, and improve its face validity. A case series analysis is presented. The main result is that the street children population consists of distinct subgroups defined by the UNICEF classification as 'on' and 'of' the street and by gender. Street children networks have some notable deficiencies depending on the subgroup. Constant across the groups is the deficiency of service providers in their networks. The conclusion is that the MSNA is a suitable instrument for obtaining a social diagnosis and gathering other useful information that helps in understanding the social and health backgrounds, status and daily experiences of Kenyan scavenging street children. Applying the MSNA protocol was successful in the diagnosis and interpretation of the findings.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The study examined changes in the use of shelters in New York City by mentally ill persons with a history of homelessness who received housing placements through the New York-New York (NY/NY) housing initiative between 1990 and 1999 and the impact of the initiative on the overall demand for shelter beds in the city., METHODS: Computerized service records on housing, shelter use, and health care services were linked to create an integrated data set for 3,167 persons who received NY/NY housing placements, which provided mental health services, and for a matched control group of persons with mental illness who used shelters but did not receive housing placements. Regression analyses were used to assess the relationships between shelter use and receipt of a placement. Differences in postplacement shelter use between NY/NY housing recipients and the matched control group were then examined at an individual level and a population level., RESULTS: Heavy users of the shelter system were more likely to be placed in NY/NY housing. In the two-year postplacement period, persons who received a NY/NY housing placement used, on average, 128.2 fewer shelter days than those in the control group. In 1996, the NY/NY housing initiative reduced the average nightly census in New York City shelters by an estimated 4.6 percent., CONCLUSIONS: Providing housing combined with mental health services is an effective approach to reducing shelter use among mentally ill persons who have a history of homelessness.

N2  - When addressing tobacco control and smoking cessation measures, the homeless have been perceived as a difficult to reach population. The purpose of this study was to examine the smoking characteristics of a homeless population. Data were derived from a larger study that examined smoking among inner-city residents. Homeless smokers (n = 107) were compared to nonhomeless smokers (n = 491) on sociodemographics, smoking characteristics, motivation to quit, and smoking cessation experiences. Results showed that homeless smokers were more likely to be white, smoke more cigarettes per day, initiate smoking at a younger age, and have a longer smoking history. Knowledge about the risks of smoking and the benefits of quitting was equally high in both groups. Homeless smokers were less likely to be preparing to quit smoking compared to nonhomeless smokers. These factors place homeless smokers at increased risk of tobacco-related diseases. Programs are needed to design and test effective cessation interventions for homeless smokers.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: The availability of urine based testing for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) provides a unique opportunity to screen for these pathogens outside traditional clinical settings. The researchers investigated the feasibility of street based CT/GC screening in the context of an outreach programme among street/homeless adolescents in Denver., OBJECTIVES: To describe the integration of urine based CT/GC screening into an existing outreach programme among street/homeless youths and the yield of CT/GC testing in this setting., METHODS: The Denver Department of Public Health (DPH) collaborated with outreach staff from Urban Peak (a community based organisation serving street/homeless youths in Denver) to offer urine based CT/GC testing to males and females in street settings. Tests were conducted on the street in areas where street/homeless youths congregate., RESULTS: Urban Peak outreach staff were trained by DPH staff to conduct CT testing, process urine specimens, and provide test results to participating youths. DPH remained responsible for treatment of people with CT or GC infection as well as CT/GC case reporting. CT testing started in January 2000; GC testing was added in July 2000. Throughout April 2002 a total of 414 CT and 302 GC tests were conducted, respectively 11.6% and 2.7% of which were positive. Among first testers, 13.0% were positive for CT and 3.7% for GC., CONCLUSIONS: CT/GC urine testing can be incorporated into existing outreach programmes without considerable extra effort. Overall CT rates were high and suggest the need for ongoing screening in this manner., LEARNING OBJECTIVE: To understand the role of CT/GC screening in the context of services provided to street/homeless youths in outreach settings.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Hunger, with its adverse consequences for children, continues to be an important national problem. Previous studies that document the deleterious effects of hunger among children cannot distinguish child from family hunger and do not take into account some critical environmental, maternal, and child variables that may influence child outcomes. This study examines the independent contribution of child hunger on children's physical and mental health and academic functioning, when controlling for a range of environmental, maternal, and child factors that have also been associated with poor outcomes among children., METHODS: With the use of standardized tools, comprehensive demographic, psychosocial, and health data were collected in Worcester, Massachusetts, from homeless and low-income housed mothers and their children (180 preschool-aged children and 228 school-aged children). Mothers and children were part of a larger unmatched case-control study of homelessness among female-headed households. Hunger was measured by a set of 7 dichotomous items, each asking the mother whether she has or her children have experienced a particular aspect of hunger during the past year--1 concerns food insecurity for the entire family, 2 concern adult hunger, and 4 involve child hunger. The items, taken from the Childhood Hunger Identification Project measure, are summed to classify the family and divided into 3 categories: no hunger, adult or moderate child hunger, or severe child hunger (indicating multiple signs of child hunger). Outcome measures included children's chronic health condition count using questions adapted from the National Health Interview Survey, Child Health Supplement, and internalizing behavior problems and anxiety/depression, measured by the Child Behavior Checklist. Additional covariates included demographic variables (ie, age, gender, ethnicity, housing status, number of moves, family size, income), low birth weight, child life events (ie, care and protection order, out of home placement, abuse, severe life events count), developmental problems (ie, developmental delay, learning disability, emotional problems), and mother's distress and psychiatric illness. Multivariate regression analyses examined the effect of child hunger on physical and mental health outcomes., RESULTS: The average family size for both preschoolers and school-aged children was 3; about one third of both groups were white and 40% Puerto Rican. The average income of families was approximately $11 000. Among the school-aged children, on average 10 years old, 50% experienced moderate child hunger and 16% severe child hunger. Compared with those with no hunger, school-aged children with severe hunger were more likely to be homeless (56% vs 29%), have low birth weights (23% vs 6%), and have more stressful life events (9 vs 6) when compared with those with no hunger. School-aged children with severe hunger scores had parent-reported anxiety scores that were more than double the scores for children with no hunger and significantly higher chronic illness counts (3.4 vs 1.8) and internalizing behavior problems when compared with children with no hunger. There was no relationship between hunger and academic achievement. Among preschool-aged children, who averaged 4 years of age, 51% experienced moderate child hunger and 8% severe child hunger. For preschoolers, compared with children with no hunger, severe hunger was associated with homelessness (75% vs 48%), more traumatic life events (8.5 vs 6), low birth weight (23% vs 6%), and higher levels of chronic illness and internalizing behavior problems. Mothers of both preschoolers and school-aged children who reported severe hunger were more likely to have a lifetime diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder. For school-aged children, severe hunger was a significant predictor of chronic illness after controlling for housing status, mother's distress, low birth weight, and child live events. For preschoolers, moderate hunger was a significant predictor of health conditions while controlling for potenns while controlling for potential explanatory factors. For both preschoolers and school-aged children, severe child hunger was associated with higher levels of internalizing behavior problems. After controlling for housing status, mother's distress, and stressful life events, severe child hunger was also associated with higher reported anxiety/depression among school-aged children., CONCLUSION: This study goes beyond previous research and highlights the independent relationship between severe child hunger and adverse physical health and mental health outcomes among low-income children. Study findings underscore the importance of clinical recognition of child hunger and its outcomes, allowing for preventive interventions and efforts to increase access to food-related resources for families.

T1  - Involving street youth in peer harm reduction education. The challenges of evaluation.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: To describe and discuss the challenges in evaluation of a participatory action research with street-involved youth., METHODS: A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods were utilized for both process and outcome evaluations. Process evaluation methods included in-depth individual interviews, focus groups, participant observation, and session debriefing forms. Summative evaluation research included focus testing of the harm reduction video and a survey of video users., FINDINGS: Members of the youth team reported favourably on the experience, citing friendship, skills development, fun, and pride of accomplishment among the key benefits of participation. Political tensions arose because of the focus on reducing harm from drug use rather than encouraging abstension. The heavy demands of participatory research and development, resource constraints and the priority given to product development in these kinds of projects necessarily precludes extensive youth participation in the design, implementation and analysis of additional evaluation research. Even when resources are directed towards evaluation, there is a tendency to focus on data collection, which may limit time and resources for data analysis. Finally, there is an inclination to focus on the product development rather than dissemination and impact of the product., INTERPRETATION: Despite the challenges inherent in participatory action research and its evaluation, this project was regarded as an empowering experience by the street youth who participated in it. It is worthwhile to direct resources to evaluation which optimally gives proportional attention to data collection as well as data analysis, and focusses not only on product development but also on its dissemination and impact.

T1  - Vulnerability factors for homelessness associated with substance dependence in a community sample of homeless adults.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - We studied a community probability sample of 1185 homeless individuals to examine substance dependence in relationship to other personal and social vulnerabilities linked to homelessness, including sociodemographics, childhood/adolescent factors, prehomelessness factors, multiple episodes of homelessness, and the quality of shelter in their current episode of homelessness. These vulnerability factors were significantly concentrated in homeless individuals with lifetime and recent substance dependence, especially among those with both alcohol and drug dependence. In addition, the profiles of the homeless with alcohol dependence alone were distinct from those with drug dependence alone or both, with older age, more males, longer histories of homelessness, and significantly poorer quality shelter during the previous 30 days. Therefore, homeless individuals with substance dependence have many vulnerabilities beyond their substance dependence that should be dealt with in treatment or other service settings before lasting housing can be achieved.

T1  - Demographic and clinical correlates of homelessness among African Americans with severe mental illness.
A1  - Whaley, Arthur L
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - The purpose of the present study is to compare the demographic and clinical characteristics of African Americans with and without an immediate history of homelessness upon entry into a state psychiatric hospital. Four variables made statistically significant contributions to the logit model predicting homelessness with the other variables controlled. They were never being married, lifetime comorbid substance abuse, severe paranoia, and high self-esteem. The four significant predictors from the logit model were used to assign patients to different risk groups. There was a significant dose-response relationship between the percentage of cases of homelessness and the number of these risk indicators.

N2  - AIMS: To describe the circumstances of the first drug injection among street youth., DESIGN: A cohort study conducted in 1995-2000., PARTICIPANTS: Subjects aged 14-25 years old were recruited in all major Montreal organizations offering free services to street youth., MEASUREMENT: Subjects who reported having ever injected drugs completed questions on the circumstances of their first injection (calendar time, location, type of relationship with the initiator, presence of others, drug first injected, source of needle and use of clean needle and other injection materials). Questions on characteristics of the initiator and prior use of the first injected drug were added during the course of the study., FINDINGS: Of 980 participants, 530 (54%) had ever injected drugs. Questionnaires were completed by 505 subjects, including 77 who also answered the additional questions. The mean age at first injection was 17.7 years. First injection occurred mainly in public places (41%). It was performed by a close friend (41%), the youth himself/herself (27%), an acquaintance (15%), a lover (10%) or another person (7%). Overall, 84% of youth first injected with a clean needle; only 62% used clean drug preparation equipment. The first drug injected was generally cocaine (47%) or heroin (41%). Two-thirds (53/77) had used the drug of first injection previously; however, the majority was not dependent upon it., CONCLUSIONS: Most street youth used clean needles at first injection, but use of other clean injection materials was less frequent. Factors other than dependence appear to play a significant role in initiation into injection.

T1  - Poverty, social exclusion and health in Portugal.
A1  - Santana, Paula
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - People in Portugal have never been so healthy. Nevertheless, there are great differences in health status between social groups and regions. In 1994, Portugal was the country with the second worst level of inequality in terms of income distribution and with the highest level of poverty in the European Union (EU). Poverty in Portugal affects mainly the elderly and women (especially in single parent families). Beyond these groups, there are the children, the ethnic minorities and the homeless. Substance abusers, the unemployed, and ex-prisoners are also strongly affected by situations of social exclusion and poverty. Although poverty has been an important issue on the political agenda in Portugal, it shows a worrying tendency to resist traditional Social Security interventions. In the late 1990s, however, welfare coverage rates appear to have risen. To what extent can poverty cause a worsening of health status? Is there any sustainable positive association between welfare and improved health status? How, to whom and when should actions to improve the health status of the disadvantaged be addressed, without subverting the health status of the rest of the population. It is also necessary to reveal the consequences of poor health to individuals, families and communities in terms of income, social empowerment and the ability to fulfil other needs. Finally, reflection on the role and effectiveness of traditional social security models is necessary, in order to improve the impact and adequacy of its interventions. The goal of this paper is to contribute to the knowledge about disadvantage, the current health situation of the most vulnerable groups in Portuguese society-those affected by poverty, deprivation and social exclusion-and to detect the constraints on access to health and health care.

N2  - In contrast to other countries as USA, Australia and some European countries there are no German studies concerning psychiatric disorders in runaway and homeless children and adolescents. Although the presence of street youths faces a big problem, there is a deficit of empirical data among this group for the planning of more efficient differential programming. In this pilot study we investigated male and female street adolescents among ICD-10 respectively DSM-IV criteria. The goal of this study was to build gender-specific hypotheses and to investigate the applicability and practicability of the standardised diagnostic instruments assessing psychiatric and substance-related disorders.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol and drug use continue to figure heavily in the experience of the contemporary homeless population. The comparison among pattern of use plays a central role in the cross-cultural view of this topic. This article shows the results of comparing the data concerning alcohol and other drug abuse and dependence among the homeless population of Madrid (Spain) and Los Angeles (USA)., METHODS: Data come from two studies carried out independently in each city. Both studies used a comparable methodology which included the same inclusion and diagnostics criteria, representative sampling methods and similar diagnostic structured interviews. In the present study, the data from these two studies are combined in a unique database which allows global and item-to-item comparison between the two studies., RESULTS: The results show different sociodemographic profiles for each city. Once controlled for the sociodemographic differences (age, education, current employment status and marital status), the life and 12-month prevalence rates of alcohol and other drug disorders (DSM-III-R) are also different. There are also significant differences in social, emotional and health problems associated with the consumption of alcohol and other drugs. The Madrid and LA samples also present differences in the time patterns of the beginning of the homelessness situation and the onset of alcohol- and drug-related disorders., CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of results is discussed in the light of the differences in both socioeconomic and cultural among Madrid and Los Angeles which might explain, in turn, differences in the homelessness situation as well as in the alcohol and other drug use patterns.

T1  - Youth homelessness in San Francisco: a life cycle approach.

A1  - Eyre, Stephen L
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - HIV risk behaviors and seroprevalence are particularly high among street youth. Though many programs have been designed to serve them, street youth have low rates of service utilization. The aim of this street-based, ethnographic project was to study the social and cultural context of street life in this population. Data were collected by participant observation, exploratory interviews and semi-structured interviews. Twenty street youth (15-23 years old; six female), recruited from street sites in San Francisco, participated in the interviews. Field notes and transcriptions were analyzed using an inductive technique for model building. This analysis yielded a proposed model of the life cycle of youth homelessness. In the first on the street stage, youth face an intense psychological feeling of outsiderness, and an urgency to meet basic needs. These stresses either lead to an escape from street life or to a process of acculturation to the street. Initiation to the street is facilitated by street mentors, who provide youth with survival skills. In the stasis stage, youth reach a tenuous equilibrium in which they can meet their basic needs. A strong street ethic allows youth to rationalize significant conflicts and frequent physical suffering. Youth in stasis are repeatedly thrown into disequilibrium, crises that frequently cause them to come into greater contact with mainstream society. After repeated episodes of disequilibrium, some youth extricate themselves from street life, finding a new identity in mainstream society. Otherwise, youth return to the street, in an episode of recidivism. The life cycle model suggests that street youth who are most open to intervention are those who are in transitional states, i.e., those who have just arrived on the street or those who are in crisis (disequilibrium). If this model is validated in a larger population of youth, programs that are aimed at these two stages in the life cycle could potentially effectively complement existing programs, which are usually focused on youth in stasis.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate mothers' experiences related to separation from their newborns during their 1st week of life, when the newborns had been transferred to a neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU)., DESIGN: A phenomenologic-hermeneutic approach. Tape-recorded narrative interviews were conducted 1 to 2 months postpartum in the participants' homes. The mothers were asked to describe and reflect upon their experiences during the time when they were separated from their children., PARTICIPANTS: Eight women whose full-term newborns had been treated in the NICU for between 2 and 10 days and then declared healthy and sent home., RESULTS: The women's narratives revealed that their experiences had caused them emotional strain and anxiety. From the analysis, three themes emerged: Being an outsider was based on feelings of despair, powerlessness, homelessness, and disappointment. Lack of control included emotional instability, threat, guilt, and insecurity. The theme of caring included trust, love, anxiety, relief, closeness, and explanations. The experiences were related to the staff, the child, the environment, the mother herself, the child's father, and other mothers., CONCLUSIONS: Separating a mother and her newborn during the 1st week of the child's life involves much emotional strain for the mother, even though the newborn is not seriously ill.

T1  - Homeless "squeegee kids": food insecurity and daily survival.
A1  - Dachner, Naomi

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Current knowledge about food insecurity in North America is largely based on research with low-income households. Much less is known about the food experiences of homeless people, a group who are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity. This study explored the food experiences of street youth, one of the fastest growing segments of the homeless population in Canada. To gain an in-depth understanding of food insecurity within the context of daily life, ethnographic research was undertaken with street youth at one inner-city drop-in centre in Toronto, Canada. Results of this study reveal that street youth's access to food was precarious amidst the instability and chaos of street life. The day-to-day lives of the street youth encountered in this study were characterized by a constant struggle to find safe, secure shelter, generate income, and obtain sufficient food. In this context, food was a precious commodity. Food access was inextricably linked to and contingent upon conditions of health, shelter, and income. Food access was precarious since everyday food sources purchased food and charitable food assistance were ultimately insecure. "Squeegeeing" (washing car windows), the primary source of income for youth in the study, was dependent on the weather, political and public will, and youth's physical health, and thus did not generate enough money to continuously meet basic food needs. Charitable food assistance was considered poor quality and was associated with food sickness. The often unsavoury atmosphere of charitable food programmes, their locations, capacity, and idiosyncratic rules, policies, and hours of operation also affected access. Findings from this study extend the current understanding of food insecurity to homeless youth and offer insight into current responses to hunger and homelessness.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to identify differences between gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) homeless youths and their heterosexual counterparts in terms of physical and mental health difficulties., METHODS: A sample of 84 GLBT adolescents was matched in regard to age and self-reported gender with 84 heterosexual adolescents. The 2 samples were compared on a variety of psychosocial variables., RESULTS: GLBT adolescents left home more frequently, were victimized more often, used highly addictive substances more frequently, had higher rates of psychopathology, and had more sexual partners than heterosexual adolescents., CONCLUSIONS: Homeless youths who identify themselves as members of sexual minority groups are at increased risk for negative outcomes. Recommendations for treatment programs and implications for public health are discussed.

N2  - PURPOSE: To increase the number of high-risk and homeless youth who receive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test results and posttest counseling., METHODS: Oral HIV testing and counseling were offered to high-risk and homeless youth at sites at which youth congregate throughout Portland, Oregon. Subjects were randomized to receive test results and posttest counseling either in a face-to-face manner or with the option of telephone notification. Self-reported demographic and risk-behavior information was collected prior to HIV testing. The differences in the proportion of youth who received their test results were analyzed according to the notification method and demographic characteristics using SPSS., RESULTS: Among the 351 youth who were tested, 48% followed up to receive test results and posttest counseling. Adolescents most likely to receive their results were female, older (19-24 years), and white and those who reported high-risk behaviors. Those given the option of telephone notification were significantly more likely to receive their results than those required to have face-to-face notification (odds ratio = 2.301, 95% confidence interval of 1.499, 3.534). This was true regardless of age, race, history of previous HIV testing, or presence of high-risk behaviors. Two youths tested positive for HIV corroborating previous reports of low HIV prevalence in this population. Both were assigned to the face-to-face notification group and, therefore, no HIV positive results were given by telephone., CONCLUSIONS: The option of telephone notification significantly increased the proportion of youth who received posttest counseling and results following community-based testing.

N2  - AIMS: To describe the characteristics of homeless children and families seen by the mental health outreach service (MHOS), to evaluate the impact of this service on the short term psychosocial functioning of children and parents, and to establish perceptions of, and satisfaction with, the service., METHODS: Twenty seven children from 23 families who were in receipt of the MHOS and 27 children from 23 families residing in other hostels where no such service was available were studied. The MHOS was delivered by a clinical nurse specialist with expertise in child mental health, who offered the following interventions: assessment and brief treatment of mental health disorders in children; liaison with agencies; and training of homeless centre staff., RESULTS: Children in the experimental group had a significantly higher decrease in Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) total scores. Having received the intervention was the strongest predictor of improvement in SDQ total scores. There was no significant impact on parental mental health (General Health Questionnaire) scores. Homeless families and staff expressed high satisfaction with the MHOS., CONCLUSION: This MHOS for homeless families is an innovative intervention which meets the complex and multiple needs of a vulnerable population unable to access mainstream mental health services. The primary objective of the service was to improve child mental health problems; however, the service developed in a responsive way by meeting social and practical needs of families in addition to its clinical role.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is increasing in London, especially in those recently entering the UK from an area of high incidence. Screening through the port of arrival scheme has a poor yield and has been considered discriminatory., METHODS: A study was undertaken to compare the yield and costs of screening new entrants in a hospital based new entrants' clinic (1262 referrals from the port of arrival), general practice (1311 new registrations), and centres for the homeless (267 individuals) using a symptom questionnaire and tuberculin testing if indicated. Clinical outcome measures were cases of tuberculosis, tuberculin reactors requiring chemoprophylaxis and BCG vaccinations. Cost outcomes were cost per individual screened and cost per individual per case of tuberculosis prevented., RESULTS: Verbal screening limited tuberculin testing to 16% of those in general practice; most were tested at the other two locations. Intervention (BCG vaccination, chemoprophylaxis or treatment) occurred in 27% of those who received tuberculin testing. Attendance for screening was 17% of the port of arrival notifications (63% had registered with a GP), 54% in primary care, and 67% in the homeless (42% registered with a GP). Costs for screening an individual in general practice, hostels for the homeless, and the new entrants' clinic were 1.26 pounds sterling, 13.17 pounds sterling and 96.36 pounds sterling, respectively, while the cost per person screened per case of tuberculosis prevented was 6.32 pounds sterling, 23.00 pounds sterling, and 10.00 pounds sterling, respectively. The benefit of screening was highly sensitive to the number of cases of tuberculosis identified and case holding during treatment., CONCLUSION: Screening for tuberculosis in primary care is feasible and could replace hospital screening of new arrivals for those registered with a GP.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated patterns of "doubled-up" homelessness using an indirect measure based on host households., METHODS: In random household telephone surveys conducted in Alabama between 1990 and 2000 and nationally in 1997, respondents indicated whether any individual had stayed with them during the past year because that person was homeless., RESULTS: The percentage of Alabama households providing shelter during the past year declined from 16.2% in 1990 to 7.1% in 2000. The national rate for providing shelter in 1997 was 18.0%., CONCLUSIONS: Many households provide shelter to people to prevent them from being literally homeless. As the economy has expanded, these rates have declined in Alabama.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: This article examines the prevalence of food insecurity in Canada, the characteristics of people most likely to live in households lacking sufficient funds for food, and several related health problems., DATA SOURCE: The data are from the cross-sectional household component of the 1998/99 National Population Health Survey and the Food Insecurity Supplement to that survey., ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES: Cross-tabulations were used to estimate the percentage of Canadians experiencing food insecurity and the prevalence of five selected health outcomes among people who were and were not food insecure. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association of several socio-demographic and economic factors with food insecurity and to determine the association of food insecurity with the selected health outcomes., MAIN RESULTS: In 1998/99, 10% of Canadians, or about 3 million people, were living in food-insecure households. Low-income households, households depending on social assistance, lone-parent families headed by women, tenants, children, and Aboriginal people had significantly high odds of experiencing food insecurity. Food insecurity was significantly associated with poor/fair health, multiple chronic conditions, obesity, distress and depression.

T1  - Factors affecting substance abuse treatment completion for women.

A1  - Blacksin, B
A1  - Mason, E
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Substance abuse by women is considered an individual pathology, and the larger social processes of recovery are seldom explored. This research study examined social factors that influenced completion of an outpatient women-centered substance abuse treatment program. The treatment records of a group of 15 women who completed the program were compared with a group who did not complete the program. More completers had previous life successes in the areas of education, job skills, and employment history. Completers also had fewer children, less involvement with child protective services, and lower levels of chaos, a construct that included the presence of two of any of the following in women's lives: child protective services, homelessness, psychiatric diagnosis, or domestic violence. Completion of substance abuse treatment seems more likely for women with personal and social resources. If programs are to be successful, adequate funding must be provided for both assessment and support of the social problems encountered by the most vulnerable women.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to formally evaluate the effectiveness, professional appropriateness and acceptability of the extended role of the nurse practitioner at the Kirketon Road Centre (KRC) in Sydney, Australia. Data collection consisted of client and staff surveys and case file review by two assessors (one medical and one nursing). This paper will report on one section of this research, namely the case file review section of the study. Total study subjects were 1046 'at risk' youth, sex workers and injecting drug users attending KRC for their primary health care needs between September 1994 and April 1995. Nurse practitioners (NP) saw 613 of the clients who presented over this period. The majority of these clients were women (77.3%). The majority of NP consults were related to STD (51%), gynaecological (17%) and hepatitis (16%) issues. The results demonstrated that nurse practitioners were professionally appropriate in all aspects of expected 'best practice' in over 95% of consultations.

T1  - Resilience among abused and neglected children grown up.
A1  - McGloin, J M
A1  - Widom, C S
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Although an extensive literature has accumulated documenting the maladaptive outcomes associated with childhood victimization, a limited body of knowledge addresses resilience. This paper sought to operationalize the construct of resilience across a number of domains of functioning and time periods and to determine the extent to which abused and neglected children grown up demonstrate resilience. Substantiated cases of child abuse and neglect from 1967 to 1971 were matched on gender, age, race, and approximate family social class with nonabused and nonneglected children and followed prospectively into young adulthood. Between 1989 and 1995. 1,196 participants (676 abused and neglected and 520 controls) were administered a 2-hr in-person interview, including a psychiatric assessment. Resilience requires meeting the criteria for success across six of eight domains of functioning: employment, homelessness, education, social activity, psychiatric disorder, substance abuse, and two domains assessing criminal behavior (official arrest and self-reports of violence). Results indicate that 22% of abused and neglected individuals meet the criteria for resilience. More females met the criteria for resilience and females were successful across a greater number of domains than males. We speculate on the meaning of these findings and discuss implications for the child maltreatment field. Limitations of the study are also acknowledged.

T1  - Homeless mothers with severe mental illnesses and their children: predictors of family reunification.
A1  - Hoffman, D
A1  - Rosenheck, R
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Although many homeless women lose physical custody of children, prior studies have not examined predictors of reunification. To explore factors associated with separation and potential resources for reunification, baseline data from 1,542 homeless women with mental illness were used to identify unique characteristics of separated mothers. Separated mothers demonstrated greater vulnerabilities than accompanied mothers did, but more resources than women who are not mothers did. Of 698 separated mothers, 118 (17%) were reunited with children at 12 months. Changes in housing, psychosis, substance use and therapeutic relationships predicted reunification. Results suggest that programs for homeless mothers with severe mental illness can affect changes that promote family reunification.

T1  - Evaluating the impact of peer, nurse case-managed, and standard HIV risk-reduction programs on psychosocial and health-promoting behavioral outcomes among homeless women.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Investigators examined the 6-month impact of three cognitive-behavioral HIV risk-reduction programs on behavioral factors (substance use and sexual risk behaviors) and cognitive and psychological resources of 325 women who resided in emergency or sober-living shelters and their 308 intimate sexual partners. Participants were randomized by shelter to a peer-mentored, a nurse case-managed, or a standard care HIV risk-reduction program. Significant improvements were observed in all groups in all behavioral factors and cognitive and psychological resources except for self-esteem. Participants in the peer-mentored and nurse case-managed groups did not differ significantly from the standard group in self-esteem, life satisfaction, psychological well-being, use of noninjection drugs, sex with multiple partners, and unprotected sex at 6 months (n = 633). It was concluded that a standard approach by health care professionals appears to effectively modify HIV risk behaviors for a majority of homeless participants and may have important economic and policy implications. Further, the impact of short-term programs that address psychological vulnerabilities of impoverished populations needs to be studied further. Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine the psychosocial, behavioral, and environmental profiles of homeless women, both those with and without a history of victimization, and their intimate partners. Five hundred seven homeless women and their intimate partners participated in the study. Thirty-nine percent of the women reported being physically and/or sexually assaulted as adults. Controlling for potential confounders, victimized women were more likely than others to have a history of childhood sexual and physical abuse, lifetime substance use, greater mental health symptomatology, and current risky sexual activity. Thus, homeless women with mental health and substance abuse problems ought to be screened for violent experiences and encouraged to obtain treatment appropriate to their problems to reduce their ongoing risk of victimization.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The homeless are at very high risk of suffering tuberculosis (TB). The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and risk factors for tuberculosis infection and disease among the homeless in Barcelona and to evaluate the roles of case finding and contact investigation., METHODS: Observational prevalence study carried out between 1997 and 1998., PARTICIPANTS: 447 homeless patients (394 men and 53 women) were evaluated before admission to shelters and free-meal services. At the same time, 48 co-residents with smear-positive TB patients in 2 long-term shelters were evaluated too. A chest X-ray and Tuberculin Skin Test were performed on all subjects. Sputum smears were processed by the Ziehl-Neelsen and Lowenstein-Jensen procedures in patients with radiographic findings consistent with pulmonary TB., RESULTS: Of the 447 homeless examined, 335 (75%) were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Active pulmonary TB was diagnosed in five persons (1.11%), and 62 (13.8%) had radiographic evidence of inactive pulmonary TB. Tuberculosis infection was associated with age and smoking, but not with sex or alcohol abuse. No significant differences in infection rates were found between the main group and 48 homeless co-residents of smear-positive subjects. Only 16.9% of the homeless with active TB in Barcelona in the same period were diagnosed through active case-finding, the remainder being mainly detected in hospitals (69.8%) and other several centres (13.3%)., CONCLUSIONS: Homeless individuals have a very high risk of TB infection and disease and contact investigation requires specific methods for them. Programmes of screening and supervised treatment should be ensured in this group.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare health problems and medical coverage of homeless and housed children who used a school-based health center (SBHC) for comprehensive care., METHODS: Medical charts of homeless children (n = 76) and housed children (n = 232) seen for comprehensive care at an SBHC in New York City during the 1998-99 school year were systematically reviewed and compared., RESULTS: Controlled for ethnicity and medical coverage, homeless children were 2.5 times as likely (P <.001) to have health problems and 3 times as likely (P <.001) to have severe health problems as housed children. The most common health problems identified in the homeless population were asthma (33%), vision (13%), mental health (9%), and acute problems (8%). Lack of medical coverage was evident in 58% of homeless children, compared with 15% of housed children (P <.001)., CONCLUSION: Study findings identify homeless children as being at increased risk for health problems and lack of medical coverage. These findings support use of an SBHC for comprehensive care by underserved segments of the population and a need for increased vigilance on the part of health care providers caring for homeless children.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This longitudinal study examined the relationships among patient satisfaction with substance abuse services, service use, and clinical and employment outcomes., METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 502 adults who were beginning outpatient or residential treatment for substance abuse in a managed care plan in Oregon or in fee-for-service plans in Washington State. The participants were reinterviewed after six months and after one year. Measures of satisfaction and use of services were assessed at six months and clinical outcomes at one year with the Addiction Severity Index. Multivariate regression analyses were used to estimate the relationship between satisfaction and service use and the relationships among satisfaction, use, and one-year outcomes when baseline characteristics were held constant., RESULTS: The final sample included 310 individuals (62 percent) who completed interviews at the three time points. Compared with those who were excluded because of missing data, the patients in the final sample were more likely to be white, to be better educated, to be in outpatient treatment, and to live in Oregon and less likely to be homeless. No significant differences were observed in baseline symptoms between the two groups. Satisfaction with access and effectiveness of services predicted service use at six months. Service use, satisfaction with access, and satisfaction with effectiveness were significantly associated with abstinence from substance use at one year. Neither patient satisfaction nor use of services was related to other outcomes, including employment and the presence of psychiatric symptoms., CONCLUSIONS: Although causation cannot be determined, the results of this study suggest that patient satisfaction is related to both use of services and abstinence from substance use. Longitudinal research using more detailed measures of satisfaction is needed to sort out the complex relationship between satisfaction and service use and the direct and indirect influences of these variables on outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Specific problems in sampling methodology, case-finding strategies and a standardised needs assessment in mentally ill homeless people have contributed to their being neglected as a mental health care clientele., METHOD: We assessed a representative sample of homeless people (n=102) in the highly industrialised city of Mannheim (Germany) regarding their prevalence of mental disorders (using the SCID) and their needs for mental health care (using the NCA)., RESULTS: We found high prevalences, with 68.6% of all assessed homeless persons having a current mental disorder. Thus, needs for mental health care were very common, with unmet needs predominating in all problem areas, which was supported by a very weak service utilization. Thus, even in a region with a comprehensive community mental health care network, like the study area, mentally ill homeless people are widely under-provided., CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the traditional shelter system for homeless people carries most of the mental health care burden for their clientele and must be supported by adequate interventions from community-based mental health care services. A closer connection of both sectors and a better co-ordination of the care offers seems to be a prerequisite for helping to reduce unmet mental health care needs in this specific high-risk group.

N2  - This report describes the psychometric properties of the six-item Brief Instrumental Functioning Scale (BIFS), a self-report questionnaire for measuring instrumental functioning in community populations, and the results of a study to validate the scale among homeless persons. The participants in the study were 1,509 homeless persons, of whom 1,077, or 71 percent, were seriously mentally ill, substance dependent, or both. Confirmatory factor analysis provided evidence for the unidimensionality of the items in the scale. The BIFS had high internal consistency, respectable stability, and reasonable convergent validity. The BIFS is useful for community populations when self-report data on functioning are required. Additional research is needed to develop and validate comparable scales for assessing other domains of functioning.

N2  - This study investigated an HIV prevention program for homeless young adult injection drug users (IDUs) that combined a secondary syringe exchange program (SEP) with community-level activities. Homeless young IDUs were recruited from street-based settings in San Francisco, and a structured questionnaire was administered. The secondary SEP operated in a circumscribed geographic area, and for analytic purposes respondents were assigned to the intervention site group if they primarily spent time in this area (n = 67), or the comparison site group if they primarily spent time elsewhere (n = 55). Almost all (96%) intervention site youth had used the secondary SEP in the past 30 days and were significantly more likely to regularly use SEP. In bivariate analysis, comparison site IDUs were more likely to share syringes, reuse syringes, share the cotton used to filter drugs, and use condoms with casual sex partners only inconsistently. In multivariate analysis, comparison site remained positively associated with sharing syringes (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.748; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.406-9.988), reusing syringes (AOR, 2.769; 95% CI,1.120-6.847), and inconsistent condom use with casual sex partners (AOR, 4.825; 95% CI, 1.392- 16.721). This suggests that the intervention was effective in delivering SEP services to homeless young adult IDUs, and that IDUs who frequented the intervention site had a lower HIV risk than comparison group IDUs.

N2  - AIMS: To compare potential risk factors for the transition to injecting among non-injecting heroin users (NIUs) with different injecting histories., DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from baseline structured interviews with NIUs in a study on transitions to injecting. Sample recruited by outreach or chain-referral in New York City (NYC), 1996-1998., SETTING: Recruitment of sample and interviews conducted in a NYC neighborhood where many drug users reside and/or use drugs., PARTICIPANTS: Of 575 NIUs, 67% had never injected; 16% had injected one to nine times (infrequent former injectors (IFI)); and 18% 10 or more times (frequent former injectors (FFI))., MEASUREMENTS: Controlling for age and race/ethnicity, adjusted odds ratios were estimated in multivariate logistic regression, and differences in means tested by ANCOVA., FINDINGS: FFI (compared to never injectors and IFI) were more likely: to be homeless; to be unemployed; to be long-time users; to be younger at first heroin use; to not have initiated heroin use through non-injected routes; to not be afraid of injecting themselves with needles; to sniff heroin with former IDUs; and, for both men and women separately, to have sex partners who were former IDUs. Both FFI and IFI were twice as likely as never injectors to perceive that their friends thought that it was "OK" to inject drugs., CONCLUSIONS: FFI have multiple individual and network characteristics that may increase their risk of injecting drugs. Interventions among NIUs to prevent transitions to injecting need to ascertain NIUs' injecting history and address the many potential risks that FFI have for resuming injecting drug use.

N2  - This study examined differences in self-reported rates and predictors of HIV testing between homeless and runaway youths in San Diego (N = 1,102) and Los Angeles (N = 1,167). Youths aged 13-23 were recruited from agency and street sites using a stratified probability sampling design. Interviewers administered a structured survey instrument lasting 20 minutes, which assessed youths' involvement in HIV risk-related sexual and drug-use behaviors, contact with outreach workers, and other variables. Significantly more Los Angeles youths (78%) reported testing than did San Diego youths (52%; p < .001). Multivariable analyses controlling for risk behaviors, knowing someone with HIV, and contact with outreach workers indicated that the higher rates of these factors in Los Angeles did not account for the difference in testing rates between the cities. Youths in Los Angeles were still 1.85 times as likely to be tested as San Diego youths (p < .001), possibly a result of differing normative behavior and accessibility of testing services.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - This prospective review was designed to determine the effectiveness of a broad-spectrum health intervention program for homeless and runaway youth. Diagnosis, treatment, and counseling for drug use, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and other health issues were provided all new admissions to a residential care facility during a 2-month enrollment. Education was continued during a 9-month follow-up period based on the program entitled Bright Futures, previously developed and published by the National Center for Education in Maternal and Child Health. Sixty percent of the 106 study residents had STDs on admission and 7% developed new STDs after completing therapy and undergoing counseling. Drug dependence was reduced from 41% to 3%, and 42% achieved full-time or part-time employment. Fifty-nine percent completed hepatitis B immunization with the 3-dose series. This experience suggests that an organized program of interventions in a residential care facility for homeless teenagers can significantly reduce drug dependence and STDs.

N2  - Responding to the medical needs of the homeless population across the United States exact large costs on the health care system. To provide effectively for such vulnerable populations, health care systems require creative and efficient strategies of service organization tailored to the specific needs of the homeless. However, such needs often vary by geographic region due to the inherent diversity of the population. Currently, no published medical evaluation of the urban homeless in Texas exists. Therefore, this study examines 93,074 diagnoses given to 20,331 homeless patients seen in a seven-year period in a primary care mobile and fixed clinic system. The most frequent disease conditions evaluated in this cohort of patients are reported. These findings may be useful to clinical site managers and health care planners contemplating an outreach program for the homeless.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The researchers evaluated the relative effectiveness of 2 interventions for patients with alcohol problems., STUDY DESIGN: A nonrandomized intervention study was used to compare usual care (control) with a 5- to 15-minute physician-delivered message (brief intervention) and with the physician message plus a 30- to 60-minute visit by a recovering alcoholic (peer intervention). Telephone follow-up was obtained up to 12 months after hospital discharge that focused on patient behaviors during the first 6 months following discharge., POPULATION: The study included 314 patients with alcohol-related injuries admitted to an urban teaching hospital., OUTCOMES MEASURED: Researchers measured complete abstinence from alcohol during the entire 6 months following hospital discharge, abstinence from alcohol during the sixth month following hospital discharge, and initiation of alcohol treatment or self-help within 6 months of hospital discharge., RESULTS: Valid responses were obtained from 140 patients (45%). Observed success rates were: 34%, 44%, and 59% (P=.012) for abstinence from alcohol since discharge in the usual care group, the brief intervention group, and the peer intervention group, respectively; 36%, 51%, and 64% (P=.006) for abstinence at the sixth month following hospital discharge; and 9%, 15%, and 49% (P &it.001) for initiation of treatment/self-help. During the telephone follow-up interview, several patients in the peer intervention group expressed gratitude for the help they received with their drinking problems while in the hospital. A few patients dramatically changed their lives. They went from being unemployed and homeless to full-time employment and having a permanent residence. They credited the peer intervention as being the most important factor that motivated them to seek help for their alcohol use disorder. One of these individuals serves as a volunteer, visiting hospitalized patients with drinking problems., CONCLUSIONS: Among trauma victims with injuries severe enough to require hospital admission, brief advice from a physician followed by a visit with a recovering alcoholic appears to be an effective intervention. Although further study is needed to confirm these findings, in the meantime physicians can request that members of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) visit their hospitalized patients who have alcohol use disorders. Interventions by recovering alcoholics are part of their twelfth-step work (an essential part of the AA program) and are simple, practical, involve no costs, and pose little patient risk. They can be arranged from the patient's bedside telephone. Some patients will show a dramatic response to these peer visits.

N2  - Detection of current (past 30 days) drug use by analysis of hair was examined along with self-reports of current use in a 1994 treatment needs assessment survey; the sample was 179 homeless/transient adults in New York state. Results of radioimmunoassay of hair (RIAH) were used to evaluate the veracity of self-reports of current cocaine use. Only 26% of those persons whose hair tested positive for cocaine (n=115) admitted to having used cocaine in the past 30 days. Subjects eligible for treatment, as indicated by a DSM-III-R diagnosis of cocaine dependency, were nearly four times as likely to admit current cocaine use than those who were not dependent. These results are consistent with other studies of populations at high risk for substance use.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the behavioral and emotional problems of former unaccompanied refugee children who had repatriated to Vietnam from refugee centers in Hong Kong and South East Asia. The children were compared with a matched sample of children who had never left Vietnam., METHOD: The participants consisted of 455 Vietnamese children aged between 10 and 22 years; 238 of the children had formerly resided in refugee camps without their parents. Data were collected using the Achenbach Youth Self-Report, the Cowen Perceived Self-Efficacy scale, a Social Support scale as well as an Exposure to Trauma scale., RESULTS: No significant difference was found between the two groups of children on the YSR Total Score. The former refugee children had significantly lower Externalizing scores and failed marginally to report significantly higher Internalizing scores than the local children. The study showed that the perceived self-efficacy, number of social supports and experience of social support did not differ between the two groups of children. Further analysis showed that a significant interaction between the immigration status of the children and the children's subjective perception of their current standard of living explained the differences in the YSR., CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the experience of living without parents in a refugee camp does not lead to increased behavioral and emotional problems in the immediate years after repatriation.

T1  - Educating the public about mental illness and homelessness: a cautionary note.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the viewing of a video depicting the successful struggles of homeless persons with mental illness in finding and maintaining housing can have a positive impact on attitudes toward homeless persons with mental illness., METHOD: Five hundred and seventy-five high school students attending a brief educational session on mental illness participated in 1 of 3 comparison versions of the 2-hour program (control, video, video plus discussion). All completed an "Attitudes toward Homelessness and Mental Illness Questionnaire." Demographic and prior exposure variables were entered as a covariates in between-group analyses of variance., RESULTS: Females and subjects who had more prior encounters with homeless persons were found to have the most positive attitudes. After controlling for these effects, the video alone had a negative impact on attitudes relative to the other groups, while the video followed by a discussion with one of the people featured in it had a largely positive impact., CONCLUSIONS: The apparent immediacy and the evocative power of video presentations cannot substitute for direct contact for the purpose of promoting positive attitude change. The findings are consistent with prior research emphasizing the importance of direct interaction with members of stigmatized groups to reduce negative attitudes. Education programs trying to destigmatize mental illness and homelessness using videos should proceed with caution.

T1  - Disadvantaged persons' participation in health promotion projects: some structural dimensions.
A1  - Boyce, W F
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - A structural perspective was used in studying community participation of disadvantaged groups (poor women, street youth, and disabled persons) in health promotion projects. Five community projects in the Canadian Health Promotion Contribution Program were examined in a comparative case study utilizing in-depth interviews, documents, and secondary sources. Analysis revealed relatively low numbers and restricted range of participants, difficulties in recruiting and maintaining participants, declining rates of active participation over time, and limited target group influence and power. This paper reports on the relationship between various dimensions of structure (social-cultural, organizational, political-legal-economic) and the community participation process. Participation was influenced by structural factors such as bureaucratic rules and regulators, perceived minority group rights and relations, agency reputations and responsibilities, available resources, and organizational roles. Control of projects by target group members, rather than by service agencies, was an important overall organizational structural factor which allowed community members to achieve influence in projects. The study concludes that a conceptual model based on structural factors is useful in explaining how key factors from federal and local levels can restrict or facilitate the community participation process.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was a reliable assessment of the prevalence of DSM-IV mental disorders in a representative sample of homeless men in the city of Munich., METHOD: A preliminary survey yielded an estimate of 1,022 single homeless men in Munich divided among three sectors (shelter users, service users and street dwellers). A random sample of 265 single homeless men was surveyed from these three sectors. An age-matched comparison group of 178 men was selected randomly from a community register. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV) was used for diagnostic classification., RESULTS: The lifetime prevalence rates of mental disorders were as follows: 72.7% vs. 15.2% for alcohol dependence, 32.8% vs. 7.3% for mood disorders, 15.9% vs. 6.2% for anxiety disorders and 9.8% vs. 0.6% for psychotic disorders. Of the homeless males in Munich, 93.2% had at least one lifetime DSM-IV axis I diagnosis, while this was the case for only 38.2% of the community controls. One-month prevalence for all SCID DSM-IV axis I disorders in homeless males was 73.4%., CONCLUSION: Lifetime DSM-IV axis I mental disorders were 2.4 times more frequent among homeless individuals compared to community control. Implications for health care planning are discussed.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - The purpose of this study was to compare the stressors and coping behaviors of homeless, previously homeless, and never homeless poor school-aged children. Content analyses of interview data from 132 children were used. Forty-four (68%) of the homeless children identified at least one stressor related to being homeless. The three groups of children were similar in regard to stressors related to the family, self, peers, health, school, and environment. In regard to the violent behavior category, significantly more of the previously homeless and never homeless children expressed stressors compared to the homeless children. Significantly more previously homeless and never homeless children identified more social support coping behaviors compared to the homeless children. The three groups of children did not differ in regard to the use of behavioral and cognitive coping strategies.

N2  - Over 8,000 adolescents and young adults (4,111 males; 4,085 females) reported on several HIV-related risk behaviors during enrollment into 10 service demonstration projects targeted to youth living with, or at risk for, HIV. Distinct risk patterns emerged by gender when predicting HIV serostatus (versus unknown serostatus/negative serostatus). Males who had injection drug risk histories, had sex with an HIV positive partner, had sexually transmitted diseases, had sex with males, and/or were homeless had an inflated risk of being HIV positive. Females who engaged in sex with an HIV partner, had sex with an injection drug user, and/or had sexually transmitted diseases, were at the highest HIV risk. For both samples, engaging in sex with women reduced the likelihood of HIV positive status. Very basic information about risk factors obtained at service intake offers important information about HIV status of "high risk" youth presenting for care in community programs, as well as suggests clear risk factors for targeted preventive efforts.

N2  - Few studies have examined gender-specific factors associated with the nonuse of condoms among homeless and runaway youths (HRYs)-a population at high risk for HIV infection. In this article, we evaluate these factors and explore gender differences in background experiences, psychosocial functioning, and risk behaviors among HRYs from four U.S. metropolitan areas. Of 879 sexually active HRYs sampled, approximately 70% reported unprotected sexual intercourse during a 6-month period, and nearly a quarter reported never using condoms in the same period. Among males and females, having only one sex partner in the previous 6 months had the strongest association with nonuse of condoms. Among males, nonuse was also associated with having ever caused pregnancy, frequent marijuana use, prior physical victimization, and low self-control and sociability. Among females, nonuse was associated with knowledge of HIV status, prior sexual victimization, low social support, and infrequent marijuana use. These findings highlight the ongoing need for HIV prevention services for HRYs. Implications for the scope and content of these services are discussed.

N2  - This study has two objectives: (1) to examine the relationship between the involvement of community health centers (CHCs) in managed care and various center characteristics, including patient, provider, services, and financial characteristics, that are critically linked with the fulfillment of their mission and (2) to identify factors significantly associated with CHCs' involvement in managed care. Regarding the first objective, the study indicates that CHCs involved in managed care have more diversified sources of revenue and depend less on grant funding than other CHCs, and they serve a significantly smaller proportion of uninsured and homeless patients. Involvement in managed care is also associated with greater financial vulnerability, reflected in higher costs and net revenue deficits. Regarding the second objective, the study finds that CHCs have become involved in managed care largely in response to external market pressures, such as the prospect of reduced federal grant funding. Other significant factors include center size, location, and the percentage of users who are Medicaid patients.

N2  - The study examined a representative sample of the 1,060,000 individuals discharged from drug user treatment in the United States in the 12 months before September 1990, and compared self-reports of behavior 5 years before to 5 years after treatment. Self-reports about recent drug use were compared with urine samples, and the agreement between self-report and drug-test results was high. The key findings are that the number of alcohol and drug users declined markedly, ranging from one-seventh to more than one half; those who continued using drugs after treatment used them less frequently than before treatment; criminal behavior fell between one-quarter to one-half, and primary criminal support fell by one third; full-time employment did not change; homelessness, drug injection, and suicide attempts decreased by more than one-third.

N2  - Predictors and the prevalence of adverse birth outcomes among 237 homeless women interviewed at 78 shelters and meal programs in Los Angeles in 1997 were assessed. It was hypothesized that they would report worse outcomes than national norms, that African Americans would report the worst outcomes because of their greater risk in the general population, and that homelessness severity would independently predict poorer outcomes beyond its association with other adverse conditions. Other predictors included reproductive history, behavioral and health-related variables, psychological trauma and distress, ethnicity, and income. African Americans and Hispanics reported worse outcomes than are found nationally, and African Americans reported the worst outcomes. In a predictive structural equation model, severity of homelessness significantly predicted low birth weight and preterm births beyond its relationship with prenatal care and other risk factors.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Although it is widely accepted that rates of severe mental illness amongst single homeless people are high, little is known about the reasons these individuals become homeless. This study aimed to identify risk factors for homelessness among people with psychotic disorders., METHODS: A matched case-control study of homeless and never homeless people with psychotic disorders was carried out, with respondents recruited from mental health services (N = 39 pairs). Data were collected by semi-structured interviews and from medical records., RESULTS: A number of social and behavioural risk factors were identified; key factors being loss of contact with childhood carers, and substance use. Clinical and service use factors appeared less important as predictors of homelessness., CONCLUSIONS: Mental health services have a limited role in circumventing homelessness among people with psychotic disorders. An integrated approach involving other key agencies is required.

T1  - Social correlates and coping measures of street-children: a comparative study of street and non-street children in south-western Nigeria.
A1  - Aderinto, A A
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: This paper sought to achieve two objectives: First, to identify the social correlates attributable to street-children in south-western Nigeria as well as predisposing factors to this behavior; second, it also tried to uncover the survival mechanisms of street children., METHOD: The study was carried out in Ibadan and Lagos metropoles in south-western Nigeria. A pilot study was first conducted to clarify issues like location of the children on the streets, time of the day suitable for interview, and adequacy of the instruments. The main study involving a comparative 202 and 201 street-children and non-street children, respectively, was carried out using the questionnaire and case study approach in the two cities. Data analytical procedures involved both quantitative and qualitative methods., RESULTS: Street-children are mostly males, have low-levels of education, are predominantly Yoruba, and come from families with five or more siblings. Parents of street-children commonly had low education and were mainly found in unskilled occupations: were in contract polygynous marriages which are also often characterized by marital disruption. Street children also left home because of parental/familial reasons, chiefly among which was the inability of their parents to meet with their expectations. They survive on the streets engaging in some income-yielding activities, and are also faced with many hazards., CONCLUSIONS: The findings revealed that polygyny, large family, family disruption, and child labor were all central issues and predisposing factors to living on the streets by children. The poverty factor clearly came out as a very important factor.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To measure the incidence of homelessness among youths discharged from an inpatient facility as well as to identify factors that place these youths at risk for homelessness., METHOD: Reports of homelessness during 5 years of follow-up interviews with 83 adolescents consecutively discharged from an inpatient facility were used in conjunction with chart reviews., RESULTS: One third of youths experienced at least one homeless episode after discharge. Youths who had a history of substance use, physical abuse, running away, or being in state custody were more likely to become homeless than those without such factors. Having a thought disorder, however, was inversely related to becoming homeless after hospital discharge., CONCLUSIONS: Youths discharged from a residential treatment facility are at high risk for becoming homeless. Interventions to prevent homelessness among adolescent inpatients should be targeted to those with a history of substance abuse, physical abuse, running away, and being in state custody.

T1  - Project: HIV prevention for incarcerated youth in Indiana.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Both Indiana and national statistics suggest that HIV-AIDS cases continue to rise in the adolescent population. Because of environmental factors, incarcerated adolescents may be at a greater risk of exposure to HIV-AIDS. Educational programs, such as the one funded for this project, may be an important step in impacting the current pandemic nature of HIV-AIDS. An educational project consisting of 4 peer-based, interactive sessions was developed for incarcerated adolescents in a north central Indiana juvenile center. The project sessions were developed from the National Network of Runaway and Youth Services (1994). Project objectives were based on the AIDS Risk Reduction Model (ARRM) and were measured by a 40-item tool developed from the ARRM. Project objectives were as follows: Detainees would (a) participate in 4 educational sessions related to high-risk sexual behavior, (b) recognize and label their own sexual behaviors that put them at risk for contracting AIDS, and (c) make a commitment to reduce high-risk sexual behaviors. During the first year of state funding, 91 educational sessions were conducted, reaching a total of 196 detainees. Following comparisons of the preproject and postproject questionnaires, detainees demonstrated an increase in their ability to appropriately recognize and label risky behaviors, but they evidenced no significant commitment to change their behaviors.

T1  - Aircraft control forces and EMG activity: comparison of novice and experienced pilots during simulated rolls, loops and turns.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Flying an aircraft requires a considerable degree of coordination, particularly during aerobatic activities such as rolls, loops and turns. Only one previous study has examined the magnitude of muscle activity required to fly an aircraft, and that was restricted to takeoff and landing maneuvers. The aim of this study was to examine the phasing of muscle activation and control forces of novice and experienced pilots during more complex simulated flight maneuvers., METHODS: There were 12 experienced and 9 novice pilots who were tested on an Aermacchi flight simulator while performing a randomized set of rolling, looping, and turning maneuvers. Four different runaway trim settings were used to increase the difficulty of the turns (elevator-up, elevator-down, aileron-left, and aileron-right). Variables recorded included aircraft attitude, pilot applied forces, and electromyographic (EMG) activity. Discriminant function analysis was used to distinguish between novice and experienced pilots., RESULTS: Over all maneuvers, 70% of pilots were correctly classified as novice or experienced. Better levels of classification were achieved when maneuvers were analyzed individually (67-91%), although the maneuvers that required the greatest force application, elevator-up turns, were unable to discriminate between novice and experienced pilots. There were no differences in the phasing of muscle activity between experienced and novice pilots. The only consistent difference in EMG activity between novice and experienced pilots was the reduced EMG activity in the wrist extensors of experienced pilots (p < 0.05). The increased wrist extensor activity of the novice pilots is indicative of a distal control strategy, whereby distal muscles with smaller motor units are used to perform a task that requires precise control. Muscle activity sensors could be used to detect the onset of high G maneuvers prior to any change in aircraft attitude and control G-suit inflation accordingly.

T1  - Antecedents of physical and sexual victimization among homeless women: a comparison to homeless men.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Homeless women experience extensive health risks including physical and sexual victimization. Few studies that have gathered information on homeless persons have reported results separately for women or have compared them directly with men. Research that both investigates antecedents of victimization among homeless women and compares them to those for men is necessary to determine whether prevention efforts must be different for each group. We investigated potential antecedents of recent (past 30 days) physical and sexual victimization in a probability sample of 394 homeless women and compared findings to those for 1159 homeless men. As hypothesized, mental disorder, substance dependence, and engaging in economic survival strategies significantly predicted victimization among homeless women. With few dissimilarities, these characteristics also predicted victimization among homeless men. Although differences in the needs and experiences of homeless women and men must be recognized, both women and men require assistance to establish and maintain safe residences, treatment of any substance use and mental disorder, and alternatives to economic survival strategies that place them at risk for victimization.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study explored agency-based tracking methods for one of the most difficult-to-follow populations: runaway and homeless youth., METHODS: A total of 118 program discharges from three federally funded agencies serving runaway/ homeless youth in St. Louis, Missouri were tracked for a follow-up study of this population. Agency staff attempted to locate and interview program participants three months post-discharge using a protocol that systematically varied times and location of contact attempts. Separate analyses were conducted to compare the group of subjects whose locations were ascertained with those who were not, and who were successfully interviewed with those who were not. Variables related to the tracking protocol and individual descriptive and service use variables were examined in these analyses., RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent of the sample was successfully located and fifty-nine percent interviewed. Significant findings included: fewer contact attempts over fewer days were made for individuals successfully interviewed, individuals tracked through Division of Family Services were less likely to be both located and interviewed, and individuals successfully located were significantly younger., CONCLUSIONS: This report provides encouraging evidence that even relatively unsophisticated protocols for tracking agency clients developed in collaboration with community agencies can--with consistent implementation--yield follow-up samples that are acceptably representative of program participants.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: To determine how the demographic, clinical, and utilization characteristics of emergency department (ED) frequent users differ from those of other ED patients., METHODS: A cross-sectional and retrospective cohort study was performed using a database of all 348,858 visits to the San Francisco General Hospital ED during a five-year period (July 1, 1993, to June 30, 1998). A "frequent user" visited the ED five or more times in a 12-month period., RESULTS: Frequent users constituted 3.9% of ED patients but accounted for 20.5% of ED visits. The relative risk (RR) of frequent use was high among patients who were homeless (RR = 4.5), African American (RR = 1.8), and Medi-Cal sponsored (RR = 2.1). Frequent users were more likely to be seen for alcohol withdrawal (RR = 4.4), alcohol dependence (RR = 3.4), and alcohol intoxication (RR = 2.4). Frequent users were also more likely to visit for exacerbations of chronic conditions, including sickle cell anemia (RR = 8.0), renal failure (RR = 3.6), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR = 3.3). They were less likely to visit for all forms of trauma (RR = 0.43). Survival analysis showed that only 38% of frequent users for one year remained frequent users the next year. However, 56% of frequent users for two consecutive years remained frequent users in the third year., CONCLUSIONS: Frequent use of the ED reflects the urban social problems of homelessness, poverty, alcohol abuse, and chronic illness. Frequent use of the ED shows a high rate of decline from one year to the next. This rate of decline slows after the first year and suggests the existence of a smaller group of chronic frequent users.

N2  - This article describes data from 4,111 males and 4,085 females participating in 10 HIV/AIDS service demonstration projects. The sample was diverse in age, gender, ethnicity, HIV status, and risk for HIV transmission. Logistic regression was used to determine the attributes that best predict substance abuse. Males who were younger; HIV positive; homeless; involved in the criminal justice system; had a sexually transmitted disease (STD); engaged in survival sex; and participated in risky sex with men, women, and drug injectors were most likely to have a substance abuse history. For females, the same predictors were significant, with the exception of having an STD. Odds ratios as high as 6 to 1 were associated with the predictors. Information about sexual and other risk factors also was highly predictive of substance abuse issues among youth.

N2  - Using a multiracial sample of 621 homeless women, we tested a latent variable causal model of personal, cognitive, behavioral, and demographic predictors of two coping mediators and the outcome variables of HIV testing and return for test results and a recent STD infection. HIV testing and return were predicted by more social support, greater AIDS knowledge, greater perceived risk for AIDS, and more problem-focused coping strategies. Recent STDs were predicted by more AIDS knowledge, emotion-focused coping strategies, and risky sexual behavior and one measured variable, crack cocaine use. Emotion-focused coping strategies were predicted by drug use, less self-esteem, more social support, and greater perceived risk for AIDS. Hispanics reported less emotion-focused coping strategies than African-Americans. Predictors of problem-focused coping strategies included less drug use, more self-esteem, more social support, more AIDS knowledge, and less risky sexual behavior. African-Americans reported less problem-focused coping strategies than Latinas. Indirect effects on the outcomes mediated through coping styles are also reported. Theoretical and practical implications of results for community outreach are discussed.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - The purpose of this paper was to compare female crack users who report exchanging sex for drugs and/or money with female crack users who did not report exchanging sex for drugs and/or money. A multi-site sample of (n = 4667) female crack users who participated in the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) AIDS Cooperative Agreement Project from 20 sites were interviewed. Statistical analysis compared two groups on selected variables of interest: women crack users who reported exchanging sex for drugs and/or money (n = 2658) and women crack users who did not report exchanging sex (n = 2009). Results indicated that both groups of women had frequent unprotected sex. However, women who exchanged sex had more sexual partners, had sex more often, used drugs before and during sex more often, and had a higher rate of STDs than women who did not exchange sex. In addition, African-American women, homeless women, and women who reported past substance abuse treatment were about twice as likely to exchange sex. Regional differences were also examined.

N2  - The question has been raised whether the change from hospital to community psychiatry is accompanied by an increasing number of the mentally ill in institutions for homeless people. During week 49, 1996, the residents in institutions for homeless people in the County of Funen were interviewed and diagnosed according to ICD-8, and the results were compared with a similar study from week 47, 1990. The prevalence of psychoses was 11% in 1990 and 14% in 1996. This difference was not significant. Significantly fewer psychotic homeless people were treated for their psychotic disorders in 1996 compared with 1990. The prevalence of alcoholics had fallen by 35%, while the prevalence of narcotics and cannabis addicts had risen by 78% and 110%, respectively. These changes were statistically significant. There was still a high prevalence of personality disorders, 70% in 1990 and 60% in 1996. Even though the deinstitutionalization of the psychiatric service has not been accompanied by more psychotic patients in institutions for the homeless, the clientele is still heavily strained with psychosis, personality disorder and substance abuse.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - This study examined the amount of exposure to negative environmental risks and their association with parenting attitudes among a group of inner city substance-abusing women. Mothers (N = 198) were recruited at delivery and were part of a randomized longitudinal intervention study for substance-abusing women and their infants. When the infants were 18 months old, a cumulative environmental risk score was calculated for each mother based on nine factors: violence (both domestic and environmental), depression, homelessness, incarceration, number of children, life stress, psychiatric problems, and absence of significant other. Based on their cumulative scores, mothers were placed in a low (N = 106) or high environmental risk group (N = 92). Mothers in the high-risk group had fewer years of education and were younger when their first child was born. Multivariate analyses indicate that mothers in the high-risk group had significantly worse scores on parenting attitude scales. Given the current state of welfare reform, it is important to determine which factors besides maternal substance abuse place these mothers at risk for poor parenting.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study examines the objective and the subjectively reported state of health in a regional representative sample of homeless men (n = 50) at time of admission into a psychiatric hospital and shortly before discharge and compares the results with a control group (matched by diagnosis) of non-homeless men., METHOD AND PATIENTS: The BPRS and the SF-12 Health survey were administered. The main psychiatric diagnosis (ICD-10) were alcohol or drug addiction (84%), schizophrenic disorders (14%) and personality disorders (2%)., RESULTS: The median of hospitalisation was 26 days with no significant differences between the two groups. At discharge outpatient treatment was planned for only 16% of the homeless patients but for 40% of the controls. There was a significant improvement in symptoms and self reported state of health. On admission and discharge thought disturbance and a positive self-rating of mental health were significantly correlated., CONCLUSIONS: Against the wide-spread clinical prejudice that inpatient treatment of homeless mentally ill men is not effective our results show that the objective state of health as well as the self-perceived mental and physical health was improved by a regular psychiatric in-patient treatment. The results furthermore indicate the limitations of inpatient treatment the need for outpatient treatment programmes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study examines the objective and the subjectively reported state of health, the social network and the utilisation of mental health services in a representative group of homeless men (n = 50) at time of admission to a psychiatric hospital and compares these results with a control group (matched by diagnosis) of non-homeless men., METHOD AND PATIENTS: The BPRS, the SF-12 Health Survey and a neglection index were administered. The main psychiatric diagnosis (ICD-10) were alcohol addiction (n = 29), drug addiction (n = 13), schizophrenia (n = 7) or personality disorder (n = 1)., RESULTS: No differences were found according to sociodemographic basis data, but the homeless group had a smaller social network and less financial resources. There was a higher rate of involuntary admission in the homeless group, less contact to mental health services in the weeks before admission, more psychopathological symptoms and more physical neglection. Self-rating of mental and physical health, however, did not differ significantly. There was a positive correlation between thought disturbance and positive self-rating of mental health., CONCLUSION: The mental and physical health of the homeless patients was markedly worse. Beneath structural barriers symptoms, the extreme distress of their living situation and the decreased insight and motivation for treatment are characteristics of this group of patients which make them difficult to treat.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study identified risk factors for homelessness among indigent urban adults without dependent children and with no history of psychotic illness., METHODS: We conducted a matched case-control study, stratified by sex, of 200 newly homeless men and women and 200 indigent men and women with no history of homelessness. Newly homeless case subjects were recruited from shelter assessment centers in New York City. Never-homeless control subjects, selected from public assistance centers, were single adults applying for home relief. Control subjects were matched with case subjects according to ethnicity, age, and sex. Trained interviewers employed standardized research instruments to probe 3 domains of risk factors: symptom severity and substance use disorder, family support and functioning, and prior use of services., RESULTS: Significant interaction effects by sex were present for symptom severity, heroin use disorder, and prior service use. Greater numbers of the homeless of both sexes lacked a high school diploma and had less income from all sources, including from their families, than of the never homeless., CONCLUSIONS: Newly homeless men and women with no history of psychotic illness differed from their never-homeless counterparts in the 3 domains investigated, but socioeconomic factors were also important.

N2  - The long-term effects of two culturally competent AIDS education programs with different content on the risk behavior and AIDS-related knowledge of 410 homeless African American women 2 years after program completion were examined. Participants were members of a larger cohort of impoverished African American and Latina women recruited in Los Angeles from 1989 to 1991. Of a subsample of 527 African American women selected randomly for a 2-year follow-up interview, 410 (78%) were located and agreed to participate. Women participating in both AIDS education programs reported reduced HIV risk behaviors and demonstrated greatly improved AIDS knowledge at 2-year follow-up (p < .001). Women in a specialized program were less likely than those in a traditional program to report noninjection drug use at 2 years. Women in the traditional program had significantly better AIDS knowledge at follow-up (p < .001). These findings suggest that educational programs can produce sustained benefits among impoverished women.

N2  - This study examined the relationship between social support and the ability of Brazilian adolescents to adapt to life on the streets. Participants included thirty male street children in Rio de Janeiro. These youths, and a comparison group, were 13 to 18 years old. It was hypothesized that street children with more social support would adapt better to life on the streets. It was also hypothesized that street children with higher quality support would adapt better. Findings indicated that neither quantity nor quality of social support was related to adaptation. The implications of these findings with regard to the resiliency of street children are discussed.

T1  - Homeless parents: parenting education to prevent abusive behaviors.
A1  - Gorzka, P A
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - PROBLEM: This study sought to measure the effects of a short-term parenting course for homeless parents to decrease their parenting stress and potential for abusive parenting behaviors., SAMPLE: Nineteen homeless parents lived in a family emergency shelter for homeless families in Hillsborough County, FL. Their average length of shelter stay was 3 weeks., METHODS: Residents were invited to participate in a parenting education course consisting of three 1-hour classes weekly for 3 consecutive weeks. Class content focused on the parent, the child, and discipline. Subjects' potential for child abuse was measured with the Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory and their parenting stress with the Parenting Stress Index. A quasi-experimental pre/posttest design was used, with a t test statistic at the .05 level of significance. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze selected demographic data., FINDINGS: Results revealed significant differences in the scores of parenting stress originating from the child domain of the PSI and in the scores on the construct of unrealistic expectations of the child in the AAPI. Both scores had decreased on the posttest., CONCLUSIONS: Short-term parenting education courses may be a useful intervention strategy.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess HIV-related drug and sex risk behaviors and evaluate factors associated with change in risk behaviors among runaway and homeless adolescents, 244 street youth were recruited from a community drop-in center serving high-risk youth., METHOD: Using a cross-sectional design, approximately half of study participants received training in a peer-based intervention that included principles derived from the health belief model, while the remaining subjects received no intervention. Subjects were interviewed at baseline, immediately following the intervention (for those receiving the training) and 3 months later. Logistic regression and analysis of covariance were used to analyze intervention effects., RESULTS: Compared to youth in the control condition, runaways receiving the intervention significantly increased their knowledge about HIV. Contrary to the health belief model, in multivariate analyses knowledge and greater perceived chance for HIV were associated with high risk behavior. On the other hand, lower concern about HIV infection was also associated with high risk behavior, supporting the health belief model., CONCLUSIONS: Despite the intervention's success in increasing knowledge of HIV and AIDS, the association between knowledge, perceived likelihood of infection and high risk behaviors suggest that, without other alternatives, runaways will maintain their risks. The association noted between lower concern and high risk behaviors underscores the challenge faced in developing effective interventions with this population.

A1  - Wright, M A
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study compares homeless women who had childhood histories of foster care or other out-of-home placement to those who have not., METHOD: A countywide probability sample of homeless women (n = 179) received structured interviews., RESULTS: One-third of homeless women reported being raised apart from their parents. Among women with children under age 18, most (61.5%) had children who had lived in foster care or other out-of-home placements. Variables associated with homeless mothers' children living in foster care or other out-of-home placements were: Child was school-age, mother was age 35 or older, mother had a current alcohol or drug use disorder, mother experienced childhood sexual abuse, and mother ran away from home (when under age 18)., CONCLUSIONS: Parenting is difficult for homeless mothers who may need to place their children with others to facilitate school attendance. Parent-child interaction may be problematic in family shelters where privacy is rare. Thus, programs promoting family preservation for homeless mothers should provide parenting support as well as permanent housing.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the service needs of women in jail, the authors examined three pathways into prostitution: childhood sexual victimization, running away, and drug use. Studies typically have explored only one or two of these pathways, and the relationships among the three points of entry remain unclear., METHODS: Data on 1,142 female jail detainees were used to examine the effects of childhood sexual victimization, running away, and drug use on entry into prostitution and their differential effects over the life course., RESULTS: Two distinct pathways into prostitution were identified. Running away had a dramatic effect on entry into prostitution in early adolescence, but little effect later in the life course. Childhood sexual victimization, by contrast, nearly doubled the odds of entry into prostitution throughout the lives of women. Although the prevalence of drug use was significantly higher among prostitutes than among nonprostitutes, drug abuse did not explain entry into prostitution., CONCLUSIONS: Running away and childhood sexual victimization provide distinct pathways into prostitution. The findings suggest that women wishing to leave prostitution may benefit from different mental health service strategies depending on which pathway to prostitution they experienced.

T1  - AIDS-related knowledge, attitudes, and behavior: a comparison of Dutch students and dropouts.

N2  - School dropouts are considered an important target group for AIDS prevention. They are expected to be less knowledgeable about AIDS and to show a higher degree of risky behavior as compared with their school-attending peers. Several small-scale studies among specific groups of dropouts seem to confirm such expectations. However, due to differences in methodology, it is often difficult to compare the results of such studies with findings for youths who have not dropped out of school. The present study sought to remedy this by examining AIDS-related knowledge, attitudes, and behavior among comparable samples of Dutch secondary school students and dropouts (excluding homeless and drug-addicted adolescents). The two groups were compared with regard to knowledge about AIDS prevention, attitude toward condom use, intention to use condoms, sexual history, and condom use. Contrary to expectations, few differences were found. It was concluded that, in most respects, dropouts are similar to those who have remained in school.

T1  - Deinstitutionalization and schizophrenia in Finland II: discharged patients and their psychosocial functioning.
A1  - Honkonen, T

A1  - Salokangas, R K
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Three representative cohorts of schizophrenia patients deinstitutionalized from psychiatric hospitals in 1982, 1986, and 1990 were followed up for 3 years in Finland. Patients of the last cohort were older, more disturbed, and had been ill for a longer time than those discharged at the beginning of the 1980s. Despite this, the mortality of patients deinstitutionalized in 1990 did not increase, and their psychosocial functioning seemed to become even better during the 3-year follow-up period compared with those deinstitutionalized during the previous decade. Patients who had been discharged in 1990 were more often living alone than those discharged in the 1980s. Homelessness was rare throughout the study period. In general, patients were more satisfied with their life situation at follow-up compared with that on discharge. Furthermore, most patients were satisfied with their treatment situation. Altogether, the psychiatric care system seemed to be able to meet schizophrenia patients' need for care fairly well during the rapid deinstitutionalization process in Finland. More attention, however, should be paid to the loneliness and social withdrawal of discharged patients as well as to other disabilities in their social functioning.

T1  - Street children: a comparative perspective.
A1  - Lalor, K J
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the findings from recent studies of street children in Ethiopia., METHODS: Following a discussion of the term "street children," comparisons are drawn between Latin American and Ethiopian street children in terms of gender, age, reasons for going to the streets, family relations and structure, delinquency, drug use, groups and the outcomes of street life. In particular, the victimization of street children in Ethiopia is examined., RESULTS: Widespread abuse of street children was reported. More than half of the street boys questioned reported being "regularly" physically attacked. Street life is also highly victimogenic for street girls. Sexual offences, in particular, were widespread. Forty four percent had been raped and a further 26% had been sexually attacked., CONCLUSIONS: Similarities between Latin American street children and their Ethiopian counterparts regarding gender, background and street life experiences are noted. Comparisons concerning the victimization of street children were not possible, as this is an issue that is relatively unexamined in the Latin American context. Also, issues such as the developmental outcomes of street life and the process of leaving street life remain to be examined.

T1  - Comparing suicide attempters, suicide ideators, and nonsuicidal homeless and runaway adolescents.
A1  - Yoder, K A
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - This study considers variables that best distinguish among attempters, ideators, and nonsuicidal youth in a sample of 527 homeless and runaway adolescents from four Midwestern states. Univariate results indicate that attempters are significantly more likely than ideators and nonsuicidal youth to have experienced physical or sexual abuse by an adult caretaker, to have experienced sexual victimization while on their own, and to have a friend who attempted suicide. Multivariate analyses reveal five variables that best distinguish among the three groups: self-esteem, depression, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and having a friend who attempted suicide. Further analysis suggests that the accumulation of these risk factors greatly increases the chance that these youth will engage in suicidal behavior.

N2  - The authors present the results of a community-wide infant mortality review, describe implications for the delivery of maternal and child health services, and discuss the value of such reviews in addressing local public health concerns. The review included an analysis of birth and death certificates and medical record data; maternal interviews; review of cases and development of recommendations by provider panels; and convening of community groups to develop strategies to improve the health and health care of women and infants. The review focused on 287 infant deaths during 1990-1993. More than half of all neonatal deaths were attributable to "previable" or "borderline viable" births. Sexually transmitted infections were the most frequently identified underlying risk, and smoking was the most frequently identified prenatal risk. Homelessness, physical and sexual abuse, and alcohol use were at least twice as likely among women whose babies died than among a high risk comparison group. Panelists identified fragmented health care over the course of women's reproductive lives as a predominant theme. The authors conclude that: (a) The focus of maternal and child health care should shift to a model of women's health care that addresses the chronicity of social and clinical risks. (b) Infant mortality reviews are a valuable tool for community education, systems review, and policy development and can be applied to other public health issues with local significance. (c) Expectations about the review process's ability to produce conclusions about causality or recommendations narrowly geared to reducing infant mortality rates need to be reframed. (d) The model will be strengthened by greater participation of families affected by infant death.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study compares the prevalence of emotional, academic, and cognitive impairment in children and mothers living in the community with those living in shelters for the homeless., METHOD: In New York City, 82 homeless mothers and their 102 children, aged 6 to 11, recruited from family shelters were compared to 115 nonhomeless mothers with 176 children recruited from classmates of the homeless children. Assessments included standardized tests and interviews., RESULTS: Mothers in shelters for the homeless showed higher rates of depression and anxiety than did nonhomeless mothers. Boys in homeless shelters showed higher rates of serious emotional and behavioral problems. Both boys and girls in homeless shelters showed more academic problems than did nonhomeless children., CONCLUSION: Study findings suggest a need among homeless children for special attention to academic problems that are not attributable to intellectual deficits in either children or their mothers. Although high rates of emotional and behavioral problems characterized poor children living in both settings, boys in shelters for the homeless may be particularly in need of professional attention.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND METHODS: After an increase in the number of cases of tuberculosis, New York City passed regulations to address the problem of nonadherence to treatment regimens. The commissioner of health can issue orders compelling a person to be examined for tuberculosis, to complete treatment, to receive treatment under direct observation, or to be detained for treatment. On the basis of a review of patients' records, we evaluated the use of these legal actions between April 1993 and April 1995., RESULTS: Among more than 8000 patients with tuberculosis, regulatory orders were issued for less than 4 percent. Among patients with a variety of social problems, only a minority required regulatory intervention: 10 percent of those with injection-drug use, 16 percent of those with alcohol abuse, 17 percent of those who were homeless, 29 percent of those who used "crack" cocaine, and 38 percent of those with a history of incarceration. A total of 150 patients were ordered to undergo directly observed therapy, 139 patients to be detained during therapy, 12 patients to be examined for tuberculosis, and 3 patients to complete treatment. These 304 patients had a median of three prior hospitalizations related to tuberculosis and one episode of leaving the hospital against medical advice. Repeatedly noncompliant patients and those who left the hospital against medical advice were more likely than others to be detained. The median length of detention was 3 weeks for infectious patients and 28 weeks for noninfectious patients. As compared with patients ordered to receive directly observed therapy, the patients who were detained remained infectious longer, had left hospitals against medical advice more often, and were less likely to accept directly observed therapy voluntarily. Altogether, excluding those who died or moved, 96 percent of the patients completed treatment, and 2 percent continued to receive treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis., CONCLUSIONS: For most patients with tuberculosis, even those with severe social problems, completion of treatment can usually be achieved without regulatory intervention. Patients were detained on the basis of their history of tuberculosis, rather than on the basis of their social characteristics, and the less restrictive measure of mandatory directly observed therapy was often effective.

N2  - Two instruments were used to evaluate an agency's type and availability of services for HIV-positive and at-risk adolescents, and to assess opinions concerning healthcare referral patterns. These instruments were administered to representatives of 22 agencies from 10 categories of healthcare services. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling was used to model ratings of interagency knowledge, referral patterns, and general satisfaction with services. We found that no agencies offered youth services for inpatient adolescent-specific mental health treatment or short-term residential drug treatment; however, few offered long-term residential substance abuse detoxification services (5%), outpatient drug maintenance (5%), HIV-specific inpatient services (9%), intensive day treatment for substance abusers (9%), HIV home care (14%), HIV hospice care (14%), inpatient medical services (14%), short-term shelters (14%), long-term housing (18%), HIV-specific clinical trials (18%), and dental services (23%). Barriers to expanding care included lack of funding, transportation, and lack of awareness among youths about services. A multidimensional scaling analysis identified a tight service cluster of two community health centers and the largest public hospital serving poor communities of color, as well as a relatively tight cluster of three service agencies located on the Boston Common serving homeless youths. A third service cluster consisted of two university-affiliated medical centers and one community health center. In conclusion, we found that many critical services for HIV-positive youths are relatively scarce. Multidimensional scaling provides a visual presentation of the relationships of network sites. This evaluation of services indicates a need for increased, accessible youth-oriented HIV services and suggests that linkages across the three distinct clusters of service providers should be solidified. These methodologies can be used to develop a generic model describing the stages of linkage formation in HIV care service networks.

T1  - Side effects of alternative iron supplementation: a pilot study.
A1  - Roth, J L
A1  - Pugh, L C
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Iron deficiency anemia is a significant health problem for women. An intervention utilizing home visits by a nurse and the intake of alternate iron supplements was examined. Outcome measures of hematocrit levels and side effects are reported in this manuscript. Ten African-American inner city homeless women in transitional housing agreed to participate in this longitudinal study. Each participant was encouraged to take the alternate iron supplements for a three month period. Hematocrit values increased from recruitment through the third month. A paired t-test was significant (t value -5.39; df, 9; p < .0001). In addition, the side effect of fatigue decreased from recruitment through the third month. A paired t-test was significant (t value 3.18: df, 7: p = .015). During the weekly and monthly visits, when the subjects were asked if the supplements had any effect on their feelings of well-being, two women stated they had "little effects." In terms of side effects there were no complaints of nausea, stomach ache, or black tarry stools. Of the approximately 12 visits to each subject, constipation was reported only two times by two subjects. While the women did not report black stools they did offer that the vitamins seemed to color their stools green (three reported it one time and two subjects reported it three times). The benefits and the lack of side effects may have far-reaching implications for client populations such as the elderly and pregnant women who typically have difficulty with anemia and constipation alike. The weekly visits by the nurse may have added to the compliance and success of this program.

T1  - People with schizophrenia and their families. Fifteen-year outcome.
A1  - Brown, S
A1  - Birtwistle, J
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - BACKGROUND: This paper presents 15-year outcome data on place of residence, clinical and social morbidity and carer distress in a cohort of 179 people with schizophrenia who were living with their families in 1981-1982., METHOD: Data on morbidity and carer distress were derived from replicated patient and informant interviews using standardised research instruments. Details of residence came from patient and informant interviews corroborated by case note information., RESULTS: Thirty-nine (22%) of the original 179 patients were dead and six (3%) lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 134 patients, 74 (55%) still lived with their families, 31 (23%) lived in institutional accommodation, 26 (19%) lived alone and 3 (2%) were homeless. There was little change in the level of clinical or social morbidity or carer distress., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that most people with schizophrenia who live with their families remain significantly disabled by their illness, while their carers suffer ongoing distress. Mental health services should seek to support families who want to care for relatives with schizophrenia. Appropriate alternative accommodation must be provided when family care is not possible.

N2  - This research examined the impact of including a supportive person on the outcomes of two culturally sensitive AIDS education programs, an education-only (traditional) program and a program combining education with self-esteem and coping enhancement (specialized). Research participants in this quasi-experimental study included 241 homeless women, who were randomly assigned by residence (drug treatment program or shelter) to one of four treatment groups. The outcomes measured at baseline, 6, and 12 months were risk behaviors, cognitive factors, and psychological functioning. Study results demonstrated significant improvements at both 6 and 12 months for the entire sample in all psychological, behavioral and cognitive outcome variables except active coping. Women in the specialized program improved more on AIDS knowledge and reduction in non-injection drug use than did those in the traditional program, but their active coping scores declined. Participation of a supportive person did not appear to have any effect on outcome.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Compared a probability sample of 118 homeless adolescents (ages 12-17) from 6 shelters from throughout the 7-county Detroit metropolitan area to a matched sample of 118 housed adolescents using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC), which yields diagnoses based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed., rev.; DSM-III-R; American Psychiatric Association, 1987) criteria, and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Adolescents in the housed comparison group were matched on age, sex, race, and neighborhood characteristics. Analyses, including ones controlling for a set of 10 risk and resilience factors, indicated that the homeless showed more disruptive behavior disorders and alcohol abuse or dependence on the DISC and greater levels of symptomatology on the BSI. There were no significant group differences on drug abuse or affective disorders, and psychotic disorders were rare in both groups. This pattern of findings is not entirely consistent with popular stereotypes about homeless youth nor with many existing studies (which have often failed to include an appropriate comparison group).

N2  - In this paper we compare rates of mental disorders (major depression, dysthymia, cognitive impairment, and schizophrenia) among homeless people in Madrid and Los Angeles (LA) and examine the ordering of the onset of both conditions (i.e., homelessness and mental disorders). In the Madrid study, 262 homeless persons were interviewed using the CIDI. In the LA study, 1563 homeless persons were interviewed with the DIS. To make an item-by-item comparison, we companied the databases from both studies to submit a single database to statistical analyses. Results showed no significant differences in DSM-III-R life-time prevalence rates of mental disorders between both samples. However, the Madrid sample showed higher 12-month prevalence rates of dysthymia and cognitive impairment as compared to the LA sample. Most subjects across both cities first experienced symptoms of their mental disorders before first becoming homeless. The only significant difference was that all of the depressed adults in Madrid experienced depression prior to first becoming homeless, whereas this was the case for only 59.1% of LA depressed homeless people. We discuss the reasons for these cultural differences and their implications for cross-national public health research and intervention.

N2  - The Dynamic Recovery Project examined relationships between homelessness, substance abuse, and recovery, and investigated the effectiveness of the therapeutic community (TC) treatment model in helping homeless drug users move toward stable, drug-free living. This project compared two short-term TCs that were situated within pre-existing homeless shelters with a clean and sober dormitory. In a separate condition, peer counselors and staff were provided additional training in TC philosophy and practice to reduce program dropout. Dramatic decreases in drug and alcohol use at follow-up were verified by urinalysis. Length of time in treatment rather than specific program accounted for decreased alcohol and drug use. Important decreases in posttreatment criminality for both treatment programs were documented. The comparison group, starting with low criminality, experienced smaller, nonsignificant decreases unrelated to type of program or time in treatment. Major declines in Beck Depression Scores were evident, but were unrelated to groups or time in treatment. Training had no measurable impact on client retention or outcomes and there were no significant differences between TCs and the comparison group on posttreatment drug use, criminality, or depression. This report documents that short-term therapeutic communities can be successfully implemented in public shelters for homeless men.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study describes the development status of 127 homeless and 91 low-income housed infants and toddlers., METHODS: The Bayley Scales of Infant Development and the Vineland Screener were used to gather data., RESULTS: There were no differences between homeless and low-income housed children. However, younger children in both groups performed better than the older children on most summary scores., CONCLUSIONS: Homeless and low-income housed children did not differ in their cognitive and motor skills. However, older children scored lower than younger children on most measures of development status, suggesting that the cumulative effects of poverty may increase with time.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the association between family homelessness and children's placement in foster care., METHODS: The prevalence of homelessness in a random sample of 195 young foster children was examined., RESULTS: Almost half of the birth parents of the foster children had experienced homelessness. Those children were more likely than other foster children to have siblings in foster care and to be place with nonrelatives., CONCLUSIONS: An extremely high prevalence of family homelessness was found among children in foster care. Policy implications of the association between family homelessness and placement into foster care are discussed.

T1  - Sex, contraception and childbearing among high-risk youth: do different factors influence males and females?.
A1  - Kowaleski-Jones, L
A1  - Mott, F L
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - CONTEXT: The likelihood that adolescents will engage in sexual activity, use contraceptives or become parents is influenced by a range of attitudes and behaviors. These factors may differ for males and females., METHODS: Data on female respondents to the 1979-1992 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the linked 1994 young adult data file on their children provided background information on 959 adolescents who had been born to young mothers. Partial correlation analysis was used to examine the factors related to sexual behavior, contraceptive use and childbirth, controlling for maternal and familial characteristics, in this relatively disadvantaged sample., RESULTS: Youth who are inclined toward risk-taking and those who have run away from home are more likely than others to be sexually active. For young women, having intercourse at an early age, not using contraceptives and having a child are linked with depression, low self-esteem and little sense of control over their lives. The results for young men are less consistent and often in the opposite direction. Young people who have become parents evidence greater maturity than their childless peers; women are less likely to consume alcohol or to spend time with friends who drink, and men are more likely to participate in socially productive work., CONCLUSIONS: Although sexual behavior is tied to risk-taking in both adolescent males and females, some noticeable psychological differences are evidenced early. Behaviorally, there is room for optimism, in that young parents appear to adopt more mature traits.

N2  - During the study's first stage, 284 homeless people from crisis and long-term accommodation sites were surveyed using stratified, systematic sampling. The second stage involved a survey of a convenience sample of 100 homeless people from squats and the streets. Participants completed a questionnaire, Mantoux testing was performed and blood taken for gamma-interferon assay, liver and renal function tests. The group's health status was poor, with 72% experiencing medical conditions in the preceding two years and 77% symptoms in the month prior to interview. Bronchitis, asthma and gastroenteritis were the most commonly reported conditions; productive and persistent coughing, shortness of breath and wheezing the commonest symptoms. Twenty-one per cent had Mantoux reactions 15 mm or greater, 28% a raised GGT and 19% a raised ALT. Seventy-seven per cent smoked, 74% were current drinkers, 28% had injected drugs at some time in their lives and 14% were regularly injecting drugs. Forty-four per cent had experienced mental illness, 49% of whom reported depression and 15% schizophrenia. Homeless people in Melbourne have poor health status and engage in behaviours that place their health at risk. The high number of respiratory and gastro-intestinal complaints, the high level of cigarette smoking and injecting drug use (IDU) and the proportion likely to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) are all issues with important health consequences. Participants recruited from the street had significantly poorer health and engaged in more risk behaviours than those from accommodation sites; those from the accommodated sample were more likely to be infected with Mtb.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Many homeless youth may also be considered "thrownaway" in that they have specifically been told to leave home. In this study, thrownaway experiences among homeless youth are examined in two national samples: (a) a nationally representative sample of youth residing in youth shelters, and (b) a purposive sample of street youth in 10 cities. Prevalence of thrownaway experiences for the total samples and for demographic subgroups is provided, along with comparisons of the familial backgrounds and high-risk behaviors of youth with and without such experiences. In both samples, youth with thrownaway experiences (who constituted nearly half of each sample) were more likely than youth without such experiences to report (a) that they had attempted suicide, used marijuana and other drugs (excluding cocaine), and had been involved in the drug trade and carried hidden weapons; (b) that other family members had used illicit drugs during the 30 days before the youth left home; and (c) that they had spent at least 1 night away from home due to physical and/or emotional abuse or neglect, familial conflict, and familial substance use. Thrownaway youth constitute a particularly vulnerable subpopulation of homeless youth. A greater recognition and understanding of such youth will facilitate design of services that better address their needs.

N2  - Homeless alcohol-dependent individuals were randomly assigned to receive either a behavioral intervention (i.e., the Community Reinforcement Approach [CRA]) or the standard treatment (STD) at a large day shelter. Ninety-one men and 15 women participated. The majority of participants were White (64%), but both Hispanic (19%) and Native American (13%) individuals were represented as well. Overall, the decline in drinking levels from intake through follow-ups was significant. As predicted, CRA participants significantly outperformed STD group members on drinking measures across the 5 follow-ups, which ranged from 2 months to 1 year after intake. Both conditions showed marked improvement in employment and housing stability.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Homelessness is believed to be a cause of health problems and high medical costs, but data supporting this association have been difficult to obtain. We compared lengths of stay and reasons for hospital admission among homeless and other low-income persons in New York City to estimate the hospitalization costs associated with homelessness., METHODS: We obtained hospital-discharge data on 18,864 admissions of homeless adults to New York City's public general hospitals (excluding admissions for childbirth) and 383,986 nonmaternity admissions of other low-income adults to all general hospitals in New York City during 1992 and 1993. The differences in length of stay were adjusted for diagnosis-related group, principal diagnosis, selected coexisting illnesses, and demographic characteristics., RESULTS: Of the admissions of homeless people, 51.5 percent were for treatment of substance abuse or mental illness, as compared with 22.8 percent for the other low-income patients, and another 19.7 percent of the admissions of homeless people were for trauma, respiratory disorders, skin disorders, and infectious diseases (excluding the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]), many of which are potentially preventable medical conditions. For the homeless, 80.6 percent of the admissions involved either a principal or a secondary diagnosis of substance abuse or mental illness -- roughly twice the rates for the other patients. The homeless patients stayed 4.1 days, or 36 percent, longer per admission on average than the other patients, even after adjustments were made for differences in the rates of substance abuse and mental illness and other clinical and demographic characteristics. The costs of the additional days per discharge averaged $4,094 for psychiatric patients, $3,370 for patients with AIDS, and $2,414 for all types of patients., CONCLUSIONS: Homelessness is associated with substantial excess costs per hospital stay in New York City. Decisions to fund housing and supportive services for the homeless should take into account the potential of these services to reduce the high costs of hospitalization in this population.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the mental health needs of homeless children and families before and after rehousing., DESIGN: Cross sectional, longitudinal study., SETTING: City of Birmingham., SUBJECTS: 58 rehoused families with 103 children aged 2-16 years and 21 comparison families of low socioeconomic status in stable housing, with 54 children., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Children's mental health problems and level of communication; mothers' mental health problems and social support one year after rehousing., RESULTS: Mental health problems remained significantly higher in rehoused mothers and their children than in the comparison group (mothers 26% v 5%, P = 0.04; children 39% v 11%, P = 0.0003). Homeless mothers continued to have significantly less social support at follow up. Mothers with a history of abuse and poor social integration were more likely to have children with persistent mental health problems., CONCLUSIONS: Homeless families have a high level of complex needs that cannot be met by conventional health services and arrangements. Local strategies for rapid rehousing into permanent accommodation, effective social support and health care for parents and children, and protection from violence and intimidation should be developed and implemented.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the health status, risk-taking behaviors, and access-to-care issues of shelter-based homeless adolescents compared with a domiciled adolescent population from the same large US city., SUBJECTS: The samples consisted of 109 youth (aged 12-17 years) in emergency shelters and 1010 youth using school-based inner-city clinics., INTERVENTIONS: Adolescents completed a health history, which was followed by a physical examination., RESULTS: Homeless youth began sexual activity at an earlier age (median, 12 vs 13 years for homeless vs school-based youth), were less likely to have used birth control at their first sexual experience, and were twice as likely to have ever been pregnant. Oral and anal sex, same-sex activities (boys only), multiple sex partners in the past 30 days, depression, and substance use behaviors were reported more often by the homeless sample. The homeless youth were twice as likely to have visited an emergency department in the past 12 months. After adjustment for other risk factors, homelessness was an independent predictor of depression (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 7.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9-12.6), emergency department use in the past 12 months (adjusted OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.7), and history of pregnancy (adjusted OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3-5.2) in the final logistic regression models., CONCLUSION: This study confirms and extends past research indicating that homeless youth exhibit more risk-taking behaviors and suffer from poorer overall health than do nonhomeless youth.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Although data suggest that homelessness among persons with severe mental disorders is both distressing and common, several important epidemiologic questions remain unanswered. This study reports on the occurrence of homelessness in a quasi-representative sample of persons newly hospitalized with psychotic disorders. The authors also compared rates of homelessness in different diagnostic groups and among groups with differing symptom profiles., METHOD: The study was based on data from 237 first-admission patients hospitalized at 10 of the 12 inpatient facilities in eastern Long Island, N.Y. Consensus diagnoses were derived from multiple sources of information, including the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R. Patients were followed over a 24-month period after initial interview. Homelessness histories were based on subject self-reports., RESULTS: Fifteen percent of the patients had experienced at least one episode of homelessness before or within 24 months of their first psychiatric hospitalization. In more than two-thirds of these cases, the initial homeless episode had occurred before the first hospitalization. There were no significant differences in the risk of homelessness among diagnostic groups. Among subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia and related disorders, those with high levels of negative symptoms had a significantly greater risk of prehospitalization homelessness than those with low symptom levels., CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of homelessness observed must be viewed with profound concern by clinicians, consumers, and policymakers alike. The findings support the importance of intervening early in the course of disorder, particularly for persons diagnosed with psychotic illnesses.

T1  - A comparative study of homeless, previously homeless, and never homeless school-aged children's health.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to compare the mental health, physical health, and healthcare practices of homeless, previously homeless, and never homeless poor school-aged children. The sample was comprised of 134 children who ranged in age from 8 to 12 years. The children participated in health assessments and completed two psychometric tests: the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) (Kovacs, 1985) and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) (Reynolds & Richmond, 1985). Their mothers completed the Child Behavior Problem Checklist (CBCL) (Achenbach, 1991) and participated in an interview. The homeless (n = 67), previously homeless (n = 30), and never homeless children (n = 37) were similar in regard to their health assessment findings, reported health problems, healthcare practices, and CBCL scores. The proportions of homeless and previously homeless children with CDI scores in the clinical range were significantly greater than the never homeless poor children. The homeless children had significantly higher anxiety scores than the previously homeless and never homeless children. All three groups of children were at risk for physical and mental health problems; however, the findings suggest that school-aged children who experience homelessness may be at greater risk for depression and anxiety than never homeless poor children.

N2  - Elopement is a dangerous behavior because children who run away may encounter life-threatening situations (e.g., traffic). We conducted functional analyses of the elopement of 3 children who had been diagnosed with developmental disabilities. The results identified a maintaining reinforcer for the elopement of 1 child, but the data were difficult to interpret for 2 of the children. Subsequent reinforcer assessments were used to help to clarify the reinforcers for elopement for these 2 children. Results of the functional analyses and reinforcer assessments then were used to develop successful treatments to reduce elopement. The findings are discussed in terms of (a) the application of functional analysis methodology to elopement, (b) the use of reinforcer assessments to identify potential reinforcers when standard functional analyses are undifferentiated, and (c) the utility of assessment-based treatments for elopement.

T1  - Conduct disorder and HIV risk behaviors among runaway and homeless adolescents.
A1  - Booth, R E

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - This study was designed to assess the prevalence of conduct disorder (CD) among runaway and homeless adolescents and to investigate associations between CD and HIV risk behaviors. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children and a standardized HIV risk assessment questionnaire were administered to 219 runaway and homeless adolescents recruited from a drop-in center serving high-risk youth. One-half of the males and 60% of the females were diagnosed with CD. In multivariate analyses, CD was the strongest predictor of lifetime use of heroin and/or cocaine and exchanging sex for money, drugs, food or shelter, as well as the number of drugs used and the number of sex partners in the 3 months preceding the interview. The high rate of CD in this population, and the association between CD and both drug and sex-related HIV risk behaviors, indicate a need for interventions that consider the influence of this psychiatric diagnosis on high-risk behaviors.

N2  - This study characterizes subcultural differences within an inner-city street youth population. Variations in residential status, subsistence patterns, and service utilization according to peer group affiliation were explored. A brief structured interview was administered to 752 youth, ages 12 to 23 years, who had been living on the streets for two or more consecutive months, or who were fully integrated into the "street economy." Subjects were recruited for the study using a stratified probability sampling design, with 30% recruited from community-based service sites and 70% from street locations and at natural "hang-outs." Five street youth groups were identified: "punks/skinheads," "druggies," "hustlers," "gang members," and "loners." The results demonstrated unique patterns with respect to places stayed/slept, means of financial support and economic subsistence, and use of available services according to peer group affiliation. The implications of these findings and recommendations for future research and service provision are discussed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have addressed ocular disorders among the homeless and nonhomeless poor., METHODS: To better understand the health problems of the homeless, ophthalmic disorders were analyzed among 512 homeless and 413 nonhomeless poor individuals receiving vision-screening examinations in Los Angeles., RESULTS: Significantly, more 4- to 17-year-old nonhomeless poor were diagnosed with uncorrected visual acuity worse than or equal to 20/50 without correction (p = 0.001), total refractive errors (p < 0.0005), astigmatism (p = 0.001), and myopia (p < 0.0005) than were a control group of 4- to 17-year-old homeless individuals. More homeless individuals had extraocular muscle imbalance (p < 0.040), but fewer had external eye diseases (p2 = 0.016) than the nonhomeless poor, when age adjusted. In addition, higher rates of glaucoma and cataracts were observed in both homeless and poor nonhomeless populations than in the general population., CONCLUSIONS: Health care professionals should provide vision screenings intended to detect these ocular disorders. Screening and correction of myopia and glaucoma, in particular, can greatly improve the quality of life for those treated.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study describes medication compliance rates among a group of homeless mentally ill subjects who received assertive community treatment., METHOD: The medication compliance of 77 homeless persons who had been referred to an assertive community treatment program was prospectively evaluated at baseline and quarterly for 1 year., RESULTS: A minority of the cohort (29%) was compliant at entry into the assertive community treatment program. Compliance significantly increased after 3 months (57%) and remained high through the year. Medication compliance was associated with fewer psychiatric symptoms but not with better housing placements or fewer days in the hospital., CONCLUSIONS: Medication compliance rates among a cohort of homeless persons with severe mental illness were markedly higher after they entered a program of assertive community treatment.

T1  - Shelter-based homeless youth. Health and access to care.
A1  - Ensign, J
A1  - Santelli, J
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the self-reported risk-taking behaviors, health status, and access to care issues of 2 samples of shelter-based homeless youth who had previously been street youth (youth on streets or doubling-up with friends or lovers) and systems youth (youth involved in foster care) and to examine information on the etiology of homelessness, including parent or family of origin risk factors for both samples., DESIGN: The study population consisted of 109 shelter-based homeless youth: 41 street youth and 68 systems youth. A chart audit was completed on all youth, noting documentation of past health problems, reasons for shelter placement, and parental risk factors. Adolescents from both samples completed a health history questionnaire followed by a physical examination. Differences between the 2 samples for behaviors and disease diagnoses were examined using chi 2 and 2-tailed t tests., RESULTS: The street youth exhibited greater risk-taking behaviors and suffered from poorer health status and access to care than did systems youth. The main differences were in substance using and high-risk sexual behaviors. The street youth were more likely to report previous exposure to violence and having been victims of forced sex. Self-reported risk behaviors, including sexual activity and substance abuse were corroborated by more objective information on these items from medical record information. The street youth were more likely to be medically uninsured, to have used an emergency department in the past year, and to have used an emergency department for their last care., CONCLUSIONS: There are important variations in health needs between samples of homeless youth, often overlooked in health planning for this population. Knowledge of parent or family of origin risk factors and causes of homelessness provides important contextual information for understanding the risk behaviors and health states of homeless youth.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - We assessed changes in cognitive, psychological, and risky behavior latent variables after traditional or specialized AIDS education after 2 years using structural equation modeling (SEM) in a sample of impoverished at-risk African American women (N = 300). Both groups reported significant improvement at 2 years in their self-esteem and social resources. They also reported less threat perception, avoidant coping, emotional disturbance, HIV risk behavior, and drug use behavior. There was an advantage to specialized group membership. When compared with the traditional group at 2 years, women in the specialized group reported enhanced social resources, reduced emotional distress, less use of an avoidant coping style, and less drug use. We discuss advantages of culturally sensitive HIV risk reduction programs and the importance of connecting women with social services in their communities.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To describe prevalence and incidence of HIV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and risk behaviours in a prospective cohort of injecting drugs users (IDU)., SETTING: Vancouver, which introduced a needle exchange programme (NEP) in 1988, and currently exchanges over 2 million needles per year., DESIGN: IDU who had injected illicit drugs within the previous month were recruited through street outreach. At baseline and semi-annually, subjects underwent serology for HIV-1 and HCV, and questionnaires on demographics, behaviours and NEP attendance were completed. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify determinants of HIV prevalence., RESULTS: Of 1006 IDU, 65% were men, and either white (65%) or Native (27%). Prevalence rates of HIV-1 and HCV were 23 and 88%, respectively. The majority (92%) had attended Vancouver's NEP, which was the most important syringe source for 78%. Identical proportions of known HIV-positive and HIV-negative IDU reported lending used syringes (40%). Of HIV-negative IDU, 39% borrowed used needles within the previous 6 months. Relative to HIV-negative IDU, HIV-positive IDU were more likely to frequently inject cocaine (72 versus 62%; P < 0.001). Independent predictors of HIV-positive serostatus were low education, unstable housing, commercial sex, borrowing needles, being an established IDU, injecting with others, and frequent NEP attendance. Based on 24 seroconversions among 257 follow-up visits, estimated HIV incidence was 18.6 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 11.1-26.0)., CONCLUSIONS: Despite having the largest NEP in North America, Vancouver has been experiencing an ongoing HIV epidemic. Whereas NEP are crucial for sterile syringe provision, they should be considered one component of a comprehensive programme including counselling, support and education.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - This paper uses data abstracted from 465 client records randomly selected from the current files of a downtown medical clinic in Chicago, Illinois to examine substance use among 85 immigrant and 380 nonimmigrant homeless and "at-risk" homeless adults. Immigrants to the United States reported lower levels of current cigarette, alcohol, and drug use compared to nonimmigrants in the sample. Immigrants were also less likely to report potential substance user treatment needs. Immigrants, however, did not differ from nonimmigrants in the reported quantity or frequency of cigarette and alcohol use. Drug use among homeless immigrants was also higher than estimates of misuse in the general population. The literally homeless in the sample reported higher levels of substance use compared to "at-risk" homeless. The literally homeless were also more likely to report higher levels of consumption and were more likely to have potential substance user treatment needs. The role of stress in the etiology of substance misuse among homeless immigrants and nonimmigrants is discussed. Implications for the treatment of these diverse populations are also addressed.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics of homeless and low-income preschool-aged children, and to identify family and environmental determinants of their behavior., METHODS: An unmatched case-control design was used to recruit a sample of sheltered homeless families and a comparison group of low-income housed families who were never homeless in Worcester, Massachusetts. Seventy-seven sheltered homeless and 90 low-income housed mothers with preschool-age children were assessed using a comprehensive interview protocol. Information about mothers' housing, income, service use, par-enting practices, and children's father was obtained. Data about children's background, health, and life events were included. Standardized instruments were administered to assess mothers' mental health and their children's behavior. Comparisons of homeless and low-income housed families were used to describe the sample of 167 preschoolers. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the association of various stressors, such as homelessness, and family factors with their behavior., RESULTS: Although homeless preschoolers were significantly more likely to have experienced stressful life events, undergone a care and protection investigation, and been placed in foster care when compared with low income preschoolers, differences in adverse behaviors were minimal. Although homeless children scored higher than housed children on the internalizing, externalizing, and total problem score on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (52.5 vs 49.9, 54.8 vs 51.2, and 54.4 vs 51.1, respectively), approximately equal numbers of children from both groups scored in the clinical range. With regard to determinants of behavior, mothers' emotional status was one of the strongest independent predictors of negative behavioral outcomes on both subscales. Foster care placement and death of a child's friend were predictors of adverse internalizing behavioral outcomes on the CBCL. After controlling for housing status, parenting practices, child's age, child's history of physical abuse, and specific life stressors predicted adverse externalizing behavioral outcomes. For both subscales, housing status and behavior were only marginally associated in the multivariate model., CONCLUSIONS: Both homeless and low-income children experienced significant adversity in their lives, with homeless preschool children facing more stress. However, differences in behavior as measured by the CBCL were minimal. Mothers' emotional status, in addition to various stressors, strongly predict children's negative outcomes for both CBCL subscales. These findings emphasize the importance of preventive family-oriented interventions that address the needs of preschoolers and their mothers.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Almost all of what is known about the families of runaways and homeless adolescents is based on adolescent self-reports. The validity of such research is currently being questioned by policy makers. The purpose of this study was to compare runaway and homeless adolescent reports and parent/caretaker reports on measures of parenting, family violence, and adolescent conduct., METHOD: Reports of 120 runaway adolescents and their parents/caretakers from four Midwestern states were compared on measures of parental monitoring, parental warmth and supportiveness, parental rejection, physical and sexual abuse, and adolescent conduct. Comparison groups of nonrunaway adolescents and their mothers in two-parent and single-parent families from the same geographical area were also used for parenting and adolescent conduct measures., RESULTS: The findings indicated that although there were significant differences in means between adults and adolescents regardless of runaway status, adults and adolescent reports were in the same direction and present similar portraits of families of runaway and homeless young people. Both the parents/caretakers and their runaway adolescents reported lower levels of parental monitoring and warmth and supportiveness and higher levels of parental rejection than comparison groups of nonrunaway families. Parents/caretakers and runaway adolescents reported high levels of family violence and sexual abuse. Similarly, they concur regarding conduct problems for the adolescents., CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that runaway and homeless adolescents accurately depict the troubled family situations that they choose to leave. The policy implications for recent debates involving criminalization and mandatory return to parental custody of homeless and runaway youth are discussed.

N2  - This study examined the effects of integrating mental health, substance abuse, and housing interventions for homeless persons with co-occurring severe mental illness and substance use disorder. With the use of a quasi-experimental design, integrated treatment was compared with standard treatment for 217 homeless, dually diagnosed adults over an 18-month period. The integrated treatment group had fewer institutional days and more days in stable housing, made more progress toward recovery from substance abuse, and showed greater improvement of alcohol use disorders than the standard treatment group. Abuse of drugs other than alcohol (primarily cocaine) improved similarly for both groups. Secondary outcomes, such as psychiatric symptoms, functional status, and quality of life, also improved for both groups, with minimal group differences favoring integrated treatment.

N2  - An intensive case management intervention for homeless persons was evaluated by random assignment of 202 cases (involving 213 adults and 70 children) to the intervention or a control group. Full follow-up data (4 interviews: at baseline and at 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-ups) were available on 98 cases (105 adults and 37 children). The follow-up rates for the 2 groups were not significantly different. Based on 13 repeated measures analyses, there were 3 statistically significant linear time effects (indicating overall change across the follow-up period) and 3 linear Time x Condition interactions (indicating differential change over time for intervention vs. control participants). Regardless of condition, adult participants improved in terms of their experience of homelessness, as well as on physical health symptoms and stressful life events. Condition x Time interactions indicating positive intervention impact were observed on the quality of housing environments, stressful life events, and interviewer ratings of psychopathology.

T1  - Factors predisposing to suspected offending by adults with self-reported learning disabilities.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - BACKGROUND: This study investigated factors contributing to suspected offending behaviour by adults with a history of learning disabilities taken into custody at a city police station., METHODS: Adults charged with offences, and/or leaving custody, during a defined period, were identified as having a possible learning disability using a four-item questionnaire (Lyall et al. 1995 a). A comparison group, of similar age, sex and IQ, was identified from a database of young people with learning difficulties. Information was obtained on interview about each individual's medical, psychiatric, social and family histories and psychological assessments were undertaken., RESULTS: In contrast to the comparison group, those in the 'offending' group were more likely to have a history of the following: losing contact with their father, forensic contact in one or more family members, past homelessness, illicit drug use, experiencing an excess of recent life events, self-reported behavioural problems at school, truancy, childhood police contact and contact with probation services. All had histories of repeated offending. There was also an increased rate of drug/alcohol dependence. Only two subjects in the study group had a full-scale IQ below 70., CONCLUSIONS: These differences would suggest that the presence of childhood behavioural problems, offending behaviour by other family members, family separation and other social disruption and the development of drug and alcohol related problems are potentially the most important factors in trying to understand why one group engaged in criminal behaviour. The offending group had many characteristics in common with general offending populations.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that adverse childhood experiences are risk factors for adult homelessness., METHODS: We interviewed a nationally representative sample of 92 US household members who had previously been homeless and a comparison group of 395 individuals with no prior homelessness. We assessed childhood adversity with a structured protocol that included a previously validated scale indicating lack of care from parents and single-item measures of physical and sexual abuse., RESULTS: Lack of care from a parent during childhood sharply increased the likelihood of subsequent homelessness (odds ratio [OR] = 13), as did physical abuse (OR = 16). Sexual abuse during childhood was associated with a nonsignificant trend toward homelessness (OR = 1.7). The risk of subsequent homelessness among individuals who experienced both lack of care and either type of abuse was dramatically increased compared with subjects reporting neither of these adversities (OR = 26)., CONCLUSIONS: Adverse childhood experiences are powerful risk factors for adult homelessness. Effectively reducing child abuse and neglect may ultimately help prevent critical social problems including homelessness.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To identify risk and protective factors for family homelessness, a case-control study of homeless and low-income, never-homeless families, all female-headed, was conducted., METHODS: Homeless mothers (n = 220) were enrolled from family shelters in Worcester, Mass. Low-income housed mothers receiving welfare (n = 216) formed the comparison group. The women completed an interview covering socioeconomic, social support, victimization, mental health, substance use, and health domains., RESULTS: Childhood predictors of family homelessness included foster care placement and respondent's mother's use of drugs. Independent risk factors in adulthood included minority status, recent move to Worcester, recent eviction, interpersonal conflict, frequent alcohol or heroin use, and recent hospitalization for a mental health problem. Protective factors included being a primary tenant, receiving cash assistance or a housing subsidy, graduating from high school, and having a larger social network., CONCLUSIONS: Factors that compromise an individual's economic and social resources are associated with greater risk of losing one's home.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: Standardized estimates of the prevalence of substance use by runaway and homeless youth between the ages of 12 and 21 in various settings were compared with each other and with estimates for youth in the general population., METHODS: Four surveys were used: (1) a nationally representative survey of runaway and homeless youth residing in federally and non-federally funded shelters; (2) a multicity survey of street youth; (3) a nationally representative household survey of youth with and without recent runaway and homeless experiences; and (4) a nationally representative household survey of youth whose previous runaway/homeless status was unknown., RESULTS: For almost every substance, substance use prevalence was highest among street youth. Shelter youth and household youth with recent runaway/homeless experiences reported similar rates. In the household surveys, substance use rates were lowest and were generally comparable., CONCLUSIONS: Many homeless and runaway youth use tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs at rates substantially higher than nonrunaway and nonhomeless youth, indicating a need for comprehensive and intensive substance abuse prevention and treatment services for these youth.

A1  - Anderson, E A
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - The child-rearing practices of homeless and low-income housed mothers of preschool children in Head Start were compared. Overall, homeless mothers provided less learning and academic stimulation, less variety in social and cultural experiences, less warmth and affection, and a less positive physical environment for their children than did housed mothers. Mothers in both living arrangements provided more language stimulation to daughters than to sons. Implications of the findings for working with homeless families are discussed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that there are health and lifestyle issues among homeless persons that differentiate them from other segments of the population and that can be described as risk factors for homelessness., METHODS: This case-control study investigated health and lifestyle issues in a panel of patients visiting a health care clinic for homeless persons. The same information was collected from a panel of county indigent patients and an equal number of privately insured patients enrolled in a nearby academic family practice center., RESULTS: We found significant differences among these three groups. Differences in health problems were evident, as significantly more homeless persons reported mental health, drug and alcohol abuse, and smoking problems. There were no differences in the prevalence of other general medical conditions as listed by the patients. Homeless persons were younger than the control group respondents and more likely to be male, a member of a minority group, and unmarried. The childhood experiences of homeless persons were distinctive; they were more likely to have lived in a group home or some other nonfamily situation, considered themselves to have been delinquent, run away from home, been expelled from school, or been placed in reform school. The same held true for having been in jail as an adult. They had significantly less education, their job experiences were in manual and unskilled arenas, and they were more likely to have a gambling problem. A continuum of risk also appeared in that for the most part the characteristics and experiences of the indigent group members ranked in frequency between those of the homeless and insurance groups., CONCLUSIONS: Causes of homelessness appear to be multifactorial. Issues related to mental health, alcohol, nicotine, and other drug and substance abuse could be responsible for their medical problems, whereas other lifestyle issues might be regarded as risk factors for homelessness.

Y1  - 1996//
N2  - The present study compared 532 adolescents being detained by country juvenile authorities to 354 adolescents attending public school in reference to the volume of delinquent activity committed for a period of one year prior to the survey. Four levels of delinquent activity were developed, ranging from minor offenses such as runaway behavior to serious offenses such as assault. Participants were also compared on how they responded to several Likert-type questions that measured factors associated with the inclination to commit delinquent acts (anomie, social bonding, delinquent peer association, labeling, and self-esteem). This comparison provided information on the multiple pathways to delinquency which suggested forms of intervention.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although a priority for tuberculosis control is to achieve the maximum cure rate, compliance with chemotherapy in specific high risk groups (homeless, intravenous drug abusers, chronic alcoholics) is usually poor., METHODS: From January 1990 to December 1994 102 patients with tuberculosis (96 pulmonary, six extrapulmonary) who were poorly compliant with treatment were treated with a six month fully intermittent (twice weekly) directly observed regimen. They comprised 71 homeless subjects, 50 chronic alcoholics, 23 intravenous drug abusers, nine infected with HIV, and 11 who had previously abandoned a daily antituberculosis regimen; 53 had more than one of these risk factors. Treatment included isoniazid and rifampicin for six months and pyrazinamide during the first two months. Patients who failed to take their medication on two consecutive occasions were actively sought by telephone or by personal search., RESULTS: After two months of treatment 95 of the 102 patients had taken their medication regularly and 90 of them had negative cultures. Four of the remaining patients had negative cultures after three months. At the end of the six months 87 patients had completed treatment and were considered cured. Only 15 patients abandoned the treatment (13 of whom had more than one risk factor). Only three relapses occurred in the 102 patients at one year follow up and in the 88 patients followed for two years. Two patients required a change of treatment due to major side effects. Although intravenous drug abuse was the only predictor of non-compliance in the multivariate analysis, if the available variables in the second month of treatment were analysed, current poor compliance and abandonment of treatment in the past were found to be significantly associated with non-compliance., CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the efficacy of this intermittent regimen and the effectiveness of a directly observed treatment programme.

T1  - Drug use among street children in southern Brazil.

Y1  - 1996//
N2  - We studied the self-reported activities engaged in by children found wandering on the streets of Porto Alegre, Brazil, aiming to describe their drug abuse habits and practice of thefts or mendicancy. One hundred-and-five youngsters, 6-18 years old, were interviewed in the streets. Although the external appearance of the interviewed children lacked cues as to their life-style differences, three diverse life-style characteristics were depicted among them. Almost 25% of the children lived with their families and went to school (FAMSCH) and 46% lived with their families but didn't go to school (FAM). The other 29% spent all day long and slept in the streets (STREET). The most frequently used drug for the total group of children was tobacco, followed by alcohol, with a much higher prevalence of use of both alcohol and tobacco among children from the STREET subgroup. Alcohol was used by more than 25% of the STREET children and tobacco by 58% of the children from this subgroup, in a regular (almost daily) basis. Less than 12% of the FAMSCH children used illicit drugs. Inhalants were the preferred drugs for illicit drug experimental use. Only 4% of the children attending school sniffed solvents in a regular basis. Regular abuse of inhalants was reported much more frequently by the STREET subgroup of children, reaching a prevalence of 40%. Self-report of marijuana smoking was described to be regular by 4% of the FAMSCH children and 26% by the STREET children. A significantly higher number of the children who lived with their families in comparison to the STREET children described work activities (selling food, washing cars or polishing shoes) while out in the streets. On the other hand the practice of thefts was self-reported mainly by the children from the STREET group and only by the ones who used illicit drugs. Children who lived with their families reported less mendicancy and thefts than STREET children. These results show that very poor children might spend many hours of the day by themselves in the streets of a big city accompanied by children who are never under adult supervision. In spite of being alone for some hours a day and making friends with others who might use drugs, having a family and regularly attending school decreases the risk of delinquent acts and drug use.

N2  - Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been associated with increased rates of single- and multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis in the New York City area. In order to examine the relationship of HIV infection to drug-resistant tuberculosis in other selected regions of the United States, we established a registry of cases of culture-proven tuberculosis. Data were collected from sites participating in an NIH-funded, community-based HIV clinical trials group. All cases of tuberculosis, regardless of HIV status, which occurred between January 1992 and June 1994 were recorded. Overall, 1,373 cases of tuberculosis were evaluated, including 425 from the New York City area, and 948 from seven other metropolitan areas. The overall prevalence of resistance to one or more drugs was 20.4%, and 5.6% of isolates were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin (MDR). In the New York City area, HIV-infected patients were significantly more likely than persons not known to be HIV-infected, to have resistance to at least one drug (37% versus 19%) and MDR (19% versus 6%). In other geographic areas, overall drug resistance was 16%, and only 2.2% of isolates were MDR. In multiple logistic regression analyses, HIV infection was shown to be a risk factor for drug-resistant tuberculosis, independent of geographic location, history of prior therapy, age, and race. We concluded that HIV infection is associated with increased rates of resistance to antituberculosis drugs in both the New York City area and other geographic areas. MDR tuberculosis is occurring predominantly in the New York City area and is highly correlated with HIV infection.

N2  - The work histories of 436 sheltered homeless and low-income women were analyzed to develop a predictive model of factors that facilitate employment possibilities for some low-income women and deter others from obtaining work. Findings suggest the need for programs of education, early intervention, and job training. However, the availability of adequate jobs and affordable child care are prerequisites for poor, single mothers to become self-supporting.

N2  - In 1994 a 20-year retrospective study was conducted of 297 psychiatric patients admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation program in rural Ireland over a 15-year period (1974 to 1989). All patients were traced. Seventy-six percent had been discharged into the community, and two-thirds required supported housing. Fifty-five percent had experienced acute psychiatric readmissions, and 17 percent became new long-stay patients. The main criticisms of deinstitutionalization did not apply to these patients. No patient became homeless. One patient became involved in possible criminal activity. Four patients committed suicide, and the annual death rate was low-1.8 per 100 patients. The model of care involved was a key factor in the satisfactory outcome.

T1  - Identifying adolescent runaways: the predictive utility of the personality inventory for children.
A1  - Rohr, M E
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - This study investigated whether runaway behavior could be related to six problematic areas. Selected scales of the Personality Inventory for Children, representative of the six areas, were hypothesized to discriminate between an adolescent runaway group and a control group. Four scales correctly classified 95.1% of the runaway subjects and 100% of the control subjects with a total correct classification rate of 97.52%. It was further hypothesized that the runaway group was not significantly different from a known clinical group with moderate to severe psychopathology. Results indicated that the runaway group was not significantly different except on one scale, Delinquency (DLQ). On the DLQ scale the runaway group had a significantly higher mean score than the clinical group. Application and recommendations are presented.

T1  - Growth status of homeless Nepali boys: do they differ from rural and urban controls?.

A1  - Todd, A
A1  - Baker, R
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - The rapid increase in numbers of homeless children in cities of the developed and developing world is a matter of grave concern. A multi-disciplinary study was undertaken to examine the health and lifestyles of the homeless in Nepal in comparison to other local children. Few studies have quantified the health of street-children in the developing world using anthropometric indicators, and to our knowledge this is the first to systematically compare the homeless with appropriate controls from both rural and urban areas. Heights and weights were measured for 307 six to fourteen year-old boys (III homeless 62 squatter, 82 privileged school and 52 village boys). Height for age (HAz), weight for age (WAz) and weight for height (WHz) I-scores relative to reference data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) were used as indicators of growth status. Stunting characterized all but the school-boys, but wasting was not observed. the homeless were less stunted than either poor squatter or village boys. On arrival on the streets, they were taller than village boys, and duration of homelessness had no effect on their growth status. Thus in terms of physical growth, and despite frequent health complaints, homeless boys in Nepal fare relatively better than control groups of poor urban and rural boys. Comparative studies which reveal some successful aspects of street-life show that urban homelessness may represent an appropriate response to circumstances of poverty.

T1  - Relationship of hunger and food insecurity to food availability and consumption.

A1  - Frongillo, E A Jr
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationship of new measures of hunger and food insecurity to household food supplies and individual food and nutrient intake., DESIGN AND SETTING: A questionnaire containing the Radimer/Cornell hunger and food insecurity items and questions on eating patterns and the frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption was administered to subjects during a personal interview in their homes. A 24-hour diet recall and a household food inventory were conducted at the initial interview and at a follow-up visit., SUBJECTS: Participants were 193 women drawn from a random sample of 308 women who had completed a previous health census in a rural New York State county. Subjects' ages ranged from 15 to 40 years. All had children living at home and less than 16 years of education., STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Regression analysis was used to test for linear trends across food insecurity groups for the household food inventory scores and for the frequency of consumption of fruits and vegetables. t Tests were used to assess differences between the food secure and food insecure groups for nutrient and food group means. A chi 2 test for trend was used to examine differences in the distribution of nutrient and fruit and vegetable intake between the food secure and food insecure groups., RESULTS: A significant decrease in the frequency of consumption of fruits and vegetables and the amount of food in the household and a significant increase in scores indicative of disordered eating patterns were associated with a worsening of food insecurity status. Potassium and fiber intake and fruit consumption differed significantly between the food secure and food insecure groups. The percentage of respondents consuming less than the Recommended Dietary Allowance for vitamin C and fewer than five fruits and vegetables per day was significantly greater among food insecure respondents than food secure respondents., APPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: The quantity of food available in households and consumption of fruits and vegetables decreased with increasingly severe problems with food insecurity and hunger. In this rural population, the Radimer/ Cornell measures were useful in identifying households experiencing food insecurity and providing information about the nature of the food supply and the dietary intake problems experienced by food insecure households and persons, suggesting that these measures may be useful on community surveys designed to examine food insecurity issues.

A1  - Reston-Parham, C
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: The authors examined the outcomes of mental health consultation provided to a municipal court and the court's resulting interventions for mentally ill persons who committed minor crimes. One aim of the consultation program was to avoid criminalization of mentally ill people who committed minor offenses., METHODS: Clinical and forensic records of 96 persons charged with misdemeanors and referred to a clinical psychologist court consultant for evaluation were studied. Determination of good versus poor outcome during a one-year follow-up period was based on clients' status during the year after the court's disposition. Poor outcome was defined as the occurrence of one or more of four events during the follow-up year: psychiatric hospitalization, arrest, significant physical violence against persons, and homelessness., RESULTS: Fifty-six defendants (58 percent) were mandated to receive judicially monitored mental health treatment, as recommended by the psychologist court consultant, and 33 of them (59 percent) had a good one-year outcome. The relationship was statistically significant., CONCLUSIONS: Nonclinicians in the criminal justice system should have psychiatric assistance in making appropriate dispositions for mentally ill persons. If the judge is considering mental health treatment as a condition for eliminating or reducing punishment, then, to the extent justified by the law and the nature of the offense, the judge should both mandate and monitor the treatment on an ongoing basis.

Y1  - 1996//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: The study examined two-year housing outcomes of homeless mentally ill clients who took part in an experimental investigation of supported housing. The relationships between housing outcomes and client characteristics, such as gender, psychiatric diagnosis, and substance use, were of primary interest., METHODS: A two-factor, longitudinal design was used. Homeless clients in San Diego County who were diagnosed as having chronic and severe mental illness were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions. Half of the clients were given better access to independent housing through Section 8 rent subsidy certificates. All clients received flexible case management, but half were provided more comprehensive case management services. The housing of each individual over a two-year period was classified in one of three categories: stable independent housing, stable housing in another setting in the community, or unstable housing., RESULTS: Clients with access to Section 8 housing certificates were much more likely to achieve independent housing than clients without access to Section 8 certificates, but no differences emerged across the two different levels of case management. Housing stability was strongly mediated by several covariates, especially the presence of problems with drugs or alcohol., CONCLUSIONS: Supported housing interventions can be very successful tools for stabilizing homeless mentally ill individuals in independent community settings. Advantages include the low level of restrictiveness of these settings and the preference of many clients for independent housing. However, the success of supported housing projects is likely to depend strongly on the specific characteristics of the population being served.

N2  - The development of the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) included 12 field trials to assess proposed revisions. This article provides results from the antisocial personality disorder (APD) field trial that was conducted to obtain data of relevance to the proposals for simplification and for the inclusion of more traditional traits of psychopathy. Provided herein are the results from 4 sites that had sampled from populations of particular relevance to the diagnosis of APD (i.e., prison inmates, psychiatric inpatients, outpatients with substance use disorders, and homeless persons). The results indicated that some items from the 3rd revised Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 1987) could be deleted without affecting the diagnosis. The field trial provided mixed support for the proposal to include more traditional traits of psychopathy.

N2  - BACKGROUND: During the past 10 years, the number of homeless families has increased in every region of the United States. Despite several studies of this population, there are few data regarding the cognitive functioning of these homeless children. The aim of this controlled study was to determine the effect of homelessness on cognitive and academic functioning of children aged 6 to 11 years., METHODS: Homeless children (N = 102) and their mothers living in shelters were compared with a housed group of children (N = 178) and their mothers selected from the homeless child's classroom in New York City between August 1990 and August 1992. Groups were compared using standardized cognitive and academic performance instruments., RESULTS: Controlling for child's age, sex, race, social class, and family status, verbal intelligence (estimated by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test) and nonverbal intelligence (estimated by the Raven's Progressive Matrices) were not significantly different between the groups. However, academic achievement (measured by the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised [WRAT-R]) was significantly poorer in reading, (75% of homeless children compared with 48% of housed children were below grade level), spelling (72.4% of the homeless children compared with 50% of housed children were below grade level) and arthmetic (53.6% of homeless children compared with 21.7% of housed children were below grade level). These dramatic differences in academic performance did not appear to be related to the mother's report of the number of days missed from school or the length of homelessness, but were associated with: (1) the number of school changes for the WRAT-R reading subtest and (2) grade repetition for the WRAT-R spelling subtest., CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrae no difference in cognitive functioning between homeless and housed children. However, homeless children performed significantly more poorly than housed children in tests of academic performance.

N2  - In response to the dearth of data on substance abuse treatment among homeless mothers, this study breaks new ground in presenting 18-month follow-up data on 149 homeless mothers with young children enlisted in a substance abuse treatment program. The effects of residential compared to nonresidential services were evaluated over the follow-up period. Although dropout rates were high, predictors of dropout were identified, and the residential had a lower dropout rate compared to the nonresidential comparison group. Members of both residential and nonresidential groups evidenced improvement in alcohol and drug problems and in housing stability, regardless of the amount of time they spent in the program. This project demonstrated that homeless mothers can be more successfully engaged in substance abuse programs with provisions of residential placement in addition to participation in a therapeutic community. Future interventions can take advantage of this knowledge in designing more effective programs.

Y1  - 1995//
N2  - Project H&ART was a randomized intervention trial for homeless alcohol abusers in Albuquerque, N.M. Interventions were four months in duration and included: a high intensity program (case management plus peer-supervised housing), a medium intensity group (peer-supervised housing only); a housed, and a nonhoused control group. Clients were interviewed at baseline and re-interviewed ten months following program entry to determine substance use, housing stability and employment status. Program graduation rates were about 25% for the three housed groups. The outcome evaluation revealed significant within groups improvements in all of the outcomes, no between groups or racial outcome differences, and more favorable alcohol use and housing stability outcomes among program graduates than dropouts. On follow-up, women in the study had fewer days of alcohol use and had more days of stable housing, but were less likely to be employed, compared with men. We suggest that clients' personal motivation for recovery, rather than program-related factors, were most influential in determining outcomes.

T1  - Evaluation of a peer-led drug abuse risk reduction project for runaway/homeless youths.
A1  - Fors, S W
A1  - Jarvis, S
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Drug Prevention in Youth risk reduction program that was implemented in shelters for runaway/homeless youths in the Southeastern United States. The program focuses on knowledge, attitudes and skills that can help this group of high risk young people minimize the serious negative consequences of drug abuse. An evaluation strategy was developed so comparisons could be made between peer-led, adult-led and non-intervention groups. Dependent samples t tests and least squares ANCOVAS were used to measure pretest-posttest differences both within and between groups. Results indicate that the peer-led groups were more successful than the other two groups, and that program effects were the most powerful with the youngest group of shelter clients. Process evaluation revealed important factors related to group leader training and group management. It is concluded that well-trained and motivated peer/near peer leaders have particularly valuable contributions to make with regard to drug abuse risk reduction for shelter clients.

N2  - This article examines the multifaceted interactions among homelessness, HIV, substance abuse, and gender. Data were collected on 1,366 chronic drug users using a nationally standardized validated instrument within the Miami CARES project of a multisite federally funded program. HIV testing accompanied by pretest and posttest counseling was conducted on-site by certified phlebotomists and counselors. In addition to descriptive analyses and corresponding tests of significance, logistic regression analyses were used to clarify the complex associations between the outcome variables of homelessness and HIV, recognizing difficulties of determining temporal sequence. HIV infection was found to be 2.35 times more prevalent among homeless women than homeless men and significantly higher for homeless women. The findings indicate that among women, homelessness and HIV have a highly interactive effect increasing the vulnerability of this population and thus rendering them an extremely important priority population on which to focus public health efforts and programs.

N2  - Sexual coercion and its relationship to high-risk sexual behavior were examined in five samples of young women. Sample 1 (N = 22) consisted of sexually active adolescents aged 15 to 19. Samples 2 (N = 206) and 3 (N = 70) were recruited from among patients at three sexually transmitted disease clinics. Sample 4 (N = 51) consisted of young homeless women living on the street in a large city. Sample 5 (N = 51) was recruited from among young women on a college campus. Across all samples, 44.4% of women indicated that they had been forced into some form of sexual activity against their will. Self-reports of sexually coercive experiences were consistently related to risky sexual behavior. It appears that many young women are coerced into engaging in high-risk sexual behavior. This implies the need for greater attention to male coercive sexual behavior and women's skills for coping with such behavior.

N2  - The developmental consequences of homelessness have only recently begun to be investigated. This study examined the effects of homelessness on the self-concept, behavioral symptoms, and emotional development of preschoolers. Self-concept was examined using the Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Acceptance for Young Children and teachers rated behavioral symptoms using the Child Behavior Checklist. Emotional development was also examined. Results showed that homeless preschoolers have lower self-concepts and display more deviant behaviors on the Child Behavior Checklist than housed preschoolers of the same socioeconomic status. Recognition and understanding of emotion, however, were similar in both groups.

N2  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of active pulmonary tuberculosis in a homeless population in London and to assess whether those with suspected disease could be integrated into the existing health care system for further follow up and treatment., DESIGN: Voluntary screening programme based on a questionnaire survey and chest x ray. SETTING AND CASES: Screening programmes were set up over the Christmas period in 1992 and 1993 at a shelter for the homeless in London. An offer of screening was made to all individuals who visited the centre and an interviewer administered questionnaire was completed on those who volunteered for the screening. Chest x rays were carried out, developed, and read on site. Individuals with chest x rays features suggestive of tuberculosis or other medical problems were referred to a hospital of their choice. RESULTS AND OUTCOME: In 1992 nearly 1600 people visited the centre, of whom 372 volunteered for the screening and 342 were x rayed. Nineteen of the 342 (5.6%) had radiological features suggestive of active tuberculosis. In 1993 around 2000 homeless people visited the centre, of whom 270 volunteered for the screening and 253 were x rayed. Eleven (4.3%) had features consistent with active tuberculosis on the basis of the chest x rays and clinical examination by a chest physician. Overall, of 595 people x rayed in the two surveys, 30 (5%) had changes suggestive of active tuberculosis. Further investigations confirmed nine (1.5%) with active pulmonary disease and eight with no active tuberculosis. In 13, the diagnosis was not determined as four declined further investigation and nine did not attend their hospital appointment., CONCLUSION: Tuberculosis among the homeless remains a cause for concern. Follow up and treatment present unique difficulties. Services for the homeless need to include mechanisms for timely diagnosis and monitored treatment. Control programmes designed for the needs of the homeless are required.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of behavioural problems amongst homeless primary school-age children in an outer London borough., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of homeless primary school children and permanently housed control children., SETTING: Selected primary schools in an outer London borough., SUBJECTS: Children from non-refugee families officially accepted as homeless by the local authority, and housed controls from the same schools., OUTCOME MEASURE: Rutter behavioural rating scale., RESULTS: Fewer homeless children (38%, 18 of 48) than housed (88%, 50 of 57) were born in the UK, or spoke English at home. Only 19 (40%) of the fathers of homeless children compared with 43 (75%) of housed children's fathers lived with them. Some 49% of homeless children's scores suggested a behavioural problem, compared with 11% of controls. Altogether, 94% of homeless and 100% of housed children were registered with a general practitioner., CONCLUSIONS: High levels of behavioural problems were found in homeless children. With numbers of homeless children expected to rise in the 1990s this finding merits urgent attention.

Y1  - 1995//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the characteristics of long-term members of self-help agencies managed and staffed by mental health clients, why they sought help from the agencies, and how they differed from clients of community mental health agencies., METHODS: A survey and assessment instruments were used to obtain information on the service utilization of 310 long-term agency members as well as on their resources, history of disability, functional status, psychological disability, health problems, and DSM-III-R diagnosis. Data from management information systems of the self-help and community mental health agencies were used to compare service populations., RESULTS: The self-help agencies served a primarily African-American population (64 percent), many of whom were homeless (46 percent). Eighty-seven percent had confirmed DSM-III-R diagnoses, and 50 percent had dual diagnoses with moderate to severe substance or alcohol abuse or dependence. They had sought help from the self-help agencies primarily for resources such as food or clothing, for "a place to be," or because they were homeless. Obtaining counseling or help for substance or alcohol abuse was a less important reason for coming to the self-help agencies., CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of the persons served by the self-help agencies in the study were homeless and had a dual diagnosis of mental disorder and substance abuse. The self-help agencies provided their clients with material resources while community mental health agencies provided psychotherapeutic and medical care.

T1  - Two views of homeless children's art: psychoanalysis and Parse's human becoming theory.
A1  - Baumann, S L
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - In the past decade there has been a dramatic rise in the number of children living in shelters in the United States. The traditional literature suggests that these children are at risk for various developmental, educational, and health problems, and that they are in need of assistance. Psychoanalytic theory and Parse's human becoming theory have fundamentally different views of human nature and of human activities such as artistic expression. While both theories can contribute to the present understanding of the experience of children in shelters and provide frameworks for a shelter-based nursing practice, it is suggested in this article that psychoanalytic theory is reductionistic and prescriptive and may close rather than open new possibilities.

T1  - Substance use and treatment needs among homeless persons in Cook County, Illinois.
A1  - Johnson, T P
A1  - Barrett, M E
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - A survey of 481 homeless persons in Cook County, Illinois, was conducted to assess the prevalence of alcohol and illicit drug use in this population, and potential treatment needs. Respondents were sampled at random in emergency and transitional shelters, soup kitchens, drop-in centers, and single room occupancy (SRO) hotels. Approximately 30% were characterized as having alcohol-related treatment needs. A slightly smaller proportion (26.7%) were estimated to have treatment needs associated with drug use behavior, and 13.5% were found to have both alcohol and drug-related, or dual, treatment needs. Those with alcohol user treatment needs were mostly male, age 35 and older, White, and living in SRO hotels. In contrast, persons with drug user treatment needs found in shelter settings. Implications for the treatment of homeless persons with substance misuse problems are discussed.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To identify risk factors for homelessness among the severely mentally ill, we conducted a case-control study of 100 indigent schizophrenic men meeting criteria for literal homelessness and 100 such men with no homeless history., METHODS: Subjects were recruited from shelter, clinic, and inpatient psychiatric programs in Upper Manhattan. Clinical interviewers employed standardized research instruments to probe three domains of risk factors: severity of mental illness, family background, and prior mental health service use., RESULTS: Homeless subjects showed significantly higher levels of positive symptoms, higher rates of a concurrent diagnosis of drug abuse, and higher rates of antisocial personality disorder. Homeless subjects experienced greater disorganization in family settings from birth to 18 years and less adequate current family support. Fewer homeless subjects than subjects in the never-homeless comparison group had a long-term therapist. These differences remained when demographic variables were adjusted statistically., CONCLUSIONS: Homeless schizophrenic men differed from their domiciled counterparts in all three domains we investigated; family background, nature of illness, and service use history. Findings are discussed in relation to policy and programs for the severely mentally ill.

T1  - Criminal consequences of childhood sexual victimization.
A1  - Widom, C P
A1  - Ames, M A
Y1  - 1994//
N2  - Using a prospective cohorts design, we assess the long-term criminal consequences of childhood sexual abuse through an examination of official criminal histories for a large sample of validated cases of childhood sexual abuse, compared to cases of physical abuse and neglect and a control group matched for age, race, sex, and approximate family socioeconomic status. Compared to other types of abuse and neglect, early childhood sexual abuse does not uniquely increase an individual's risk for later delinquent and adult criminal behavior. Childhood sexual abuse victims were at increased risk of arrest as a juvenile for being a runaway. As adults, child sexual abuse victims were at higher risk of arrest for sex crimes than controls, as were victims of physical abuse and neglect. Childhood sexual abuse victims were more likely to be arrested for prostitution as adults than other abuse and neglect victims and controls, regardless of gender. However, there was no support for a direct relationship among child sexual abuse, arrests for running away in adolescence, and adult arrests for prostitution. The findings also suggest an association for males between physical abuse and arrests for violent sex crimes (rape and/or sodomy). Caution is needed in interpreting these findings because of exclusive reliance on official record data and the possible impact of agency intervention.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the prevalence of schizophrenia among the homeless population of Edinburgh resident in hostels has changed between 1966 and 1992., DESIGN: Comparison of two cross sectional surveys., SETTINGS: Hostels for homeless people in Edinburgh., SUBJECTS: In 1966 a random sample of 98 residents of three common lodging houses. In 1992 a random sample of 198 residents of nine hostels., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Prevalence of schizophrenia., RESULTS: The prevalence of schizophrenia in 1992 was 12/136 (9%) compared with 20/79 (25%) in 1966 (odds ratio 0.29; 95% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.62; P = 0.001). Adjustment for confounding by age, current hostel, and duration of unemployment by means of logistic regression produced an adjusted odds ratio of 0.22 (0.08 to 0.58)., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of schizophrenia was lower in 1992 even after other changes in the population resident in hostels occurring between 1966 and 1992 were taken into account. The findings are not consistent with an increase in the prevalence of schizophrenia among homeless people despite a 66% reduction in adult psychiatric beds in the region during 1966-92.

N2  - To identify predictors of elopement in young patients in residential treatment, runaways were compared with a matched sample of nonrunaways. Runaways were more likely to have a history of elopement, a suspected history of sexual abuse, an affective disorder diagnosis, and parents whose rights had been terminated. The results suggested that the likelihood of elopement can be accurately predicted on the basis of patient characteristics known at admission.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis has reemerged as an important public health problem, and the frequency of drug resistance is increasing. A major reason for the development of resistant infections and relapse is poor compliance with medical regimens. In Tarrant County, Texas, we initiated a program of universal directly observed treatment for tuberculosis. We report the effect of the program on the rates of primary and acquired drug resistance and relapse among patients with tuberculosis., METHODS: We collected information on all patients with positive cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Tarrant County from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 1992. Through October 1986, patients received a traditional, unsupervised drug regimen. Beginning in November 1986, nearly all patients received therapy under direct observation by health care personnel., RESULTS: A total of 407 episodes in which patients received traditional treatment for tuberculosis (January 1980 through October 1986) were compared with 581 episodes in which therapy was directly observed (November 1986 through December 1992). Despite higher rates of intravenous drug use and homelessness and an increasing rate of tuberculosis during this 13-year period, the frequency of primary drug resistance decreased from 13.0 percent to 6.7 percent (P < 0.001) after the institution of direct observation of therapy, and the frequency of acquired resistance declined from 14.0 percent to 2.1 percent (P < 0.001). The relapse rate decreased from 20.9 percent to 5.5 percent (P < 0.001), and the number of relapses with multidrug-resistant organisms decreased from 25 to 5 (P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The administration of therapy for M. tuberculosis infection under direct observation leads to significant reductions in the frequency of primary drug resistance, acquired drug resistance, and relapse.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Homeless people are at high risk for death from many causes, but age-adjusted death rates for well-defined homeless populations have not been determined., METHODS: We identified 6308 homeless persons 15 to 74 years of age who were served by one or both of two agencies for the homeless in Philadelphia between January 1, 1985, and December 31, 1988. Using a data base that contained all deaths in Philadelphia and listings of all Philadelphia residents during the same period, we compared the mortality rate for this homeless population with the rate in the general population of Philadelphia., RESULTS: The age-adjusted mortality rate among the homeless was 3.5 times that of Philadelphia's general population (95 percent confidence interval, 2.8 to 4.5). The age-adjusted number of years of potential life lost before the age of 75 years was 3.6 times higher for the homeless people than for the general population (345 vs. 97 years lost per 1000 person-years of observation). Fifty-one of the 96 deaths of homeless persons (53 percent) occurred during the summer months. Mortality rates were higher among the homeless than in the general population for nonwhites, whites, women, and men. Within the homeless cohort, white men and substance abusers had higher mortality rates than other subgroups, but even homeless people not known to be substance abusers had a threefold higher risk of death than members of the general population. Injuries, heart disease, liver disease, poisoning, and ill-defined conditions accounted for 73 percent of all the deaths among the homeless., CONCLUSIONS: Homeless adults in Philadelphia have an age-adjusted mortality rate nearly four times that of Philadelphia's general population. White men and substance abusers are at particularly high risk. Matching cohorts of homeless people to death records is a useful way to monitor mortality rates over time, evaluate interventions, and identify subgroups with an increased risk of death.

N2  - One hundred seventeen boys and 149 girls participated in a study investigating whether adolescent running away behavior is an expression of passive (internalization) or active (externalization) avoidance. Results of principal component analyses indicate that boys' running away behavior is associated with passive avoidance and internalization, whereas for girls the behavior reflects a mixed pattern simultaneously expressing withdrawal and overt deviancy.

N2  - METHODS: From June 1989 to April 1991, 394 adolescents aged 10-18 years randomly selected upon admission at a state shelter in Belo Horizonte, Brazil underwent health history interview, physical examination, serology for HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis, and stool examination. Participants were classified as street-based youths (n = 195) or home-based youths (n = 199). The age distribution was similar in both groups, although males were overrepresented among street-based youths (79.5% versus 62.3%)., RESULTS: Compared with home-based youths, street-based youths reported earlier onset (p = 0.009) and higher rates of sexual activity (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-3.3), sexual abuse (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.2-10.1), and sexually transmitted diseases (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3-6.6). Overall condom use was low in both groups. Street-based youths were 7.8 times more likely to use drugs than home-based youths (95% CI, 4.9-12.7). Inhalants and marijuana were the more commonly used drugs. Intravenous drug use was low., CONCLUSIONS: Although chronic malnutrition and multiple parasitosis were common findings in both groups, street-based youths were more likely to present disorders related to trauma and poor hygienic conditions. Antibodies to HIV were detected in four (2%) street-based youths and in none of the home-based youths. This study confirms that street youths are at higher risk for HIV infection than their home-based peers and indicates a need for HIV prevention programs targeting this population.

N2  - This study examines the differences in academic performance, adaptive functioning, and problem behaviors of 145 elementary school-age children who had experienced homelessness and a matched group of 142 mobile children with low socioeconomic status (SES). The Achenbach and Edelbrock Teacher Report Form and the Harter Self-Perception Profile for Children were used. Within groups, children displayed a range of academic and psychological functioning; about 30 percent performed in the normal range. Comparisons revealed no significant differences between homeless and low SES-mobile children. However, the children's scores taken together differed substantially from norms. These findings suggest that although homelessness is a stressful event in children's lives, long-term poverty may be a more appropriate marker of risk in children. Further, the findings imply that interventions must presume a substantial diversity of need within the various populations. A model of the dynamic of poverty, mobility, and lack of social supports is presented. Implications for intervention by schools and community agencies are discussed.

N2  - Enquiry into a marginally subnormal hemogram in two adolescents with complex conduct, dysthymic and movement disorders uncovered a striking iron deficiency and prompted a trial of replacing psychotropic medication with iron therapy. The rationale of iron therapy for behavioural disturbance was examined from the clinical, neurochemical and psychopharmacological points of view. Although further study is required to confirm the therapeutic efficacy and to define the precise nature of iron deficiency in conduct disorder, the weight of the evidence suggests that correcting the nutrient deficit may be an essential step toward a refinement of therapeutic strategies. The presence of a borderline hemogram, hypermenorrhea and malnutrition should alert clinicians to the possibility of iron deficiency, and laboratory screening for hypoferremia should be considered when assessing conduct disorder.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the hospitalization experience of a homeless population with that of the residents of a low socioeconomic area., METHODS: The homeless hospitalization records (n = 245) were compared with the records of the 3,553 residents of the Departement de Sante Communautaire of Saint-Luc Hospital territory who were admitted to the same hospital., RESULTS: The homeless population is mainly composed of young men. Mental health diagnoses are more frequent while cardiovascular and the obstetrical diagnoses are more rarely seen. Homelessness is associated with an 11.2 increased risk of organic psychosis, a 6.1 risk increase of functional psychosis and a 3.8 risk increase of personality disorders, neurosis and substance abuse. Obstetrical diagnoses are 20 times less frequent among homeless women while the cardiovascular risk did not seem to be affected in our sample. The lengths of stay are similar.

N2  - This paper evaluates and contrasts the effectiveness of two culturally sensitive AIDS education programs developed by the UCLA AIDS Nursing Network and delivered to 213 impoverished Latina homeless or drug-addicted women in Los Angeles. The Comprehensive Health Seeking and Coping Paradigm guided the program, which was implemented by specially trained Latina nurses and outreach workers. A quasi-experimental design was employed where women were randomized by site into Specialized (N = 82) and Traditional (N = 131) programs. Repeated measures ANOVAS and log-linear models were used to evaluate improvement over a two-week period for women in both groups and to identify interactions with program type. Two-week posttest analyses were also conducted to assess program effectiveness, controlling for baseline values of the measure in question, nonequivalency between groups at baseline, and selected demographic characteristics, including acculturation. Results indicated that women in both AIDS education programs improved significantly in cognitive, behavioral, and psychologic outcomes.

Y1  - 1994//
N2  - Previous research indicates that adverse childhood experiences are associated with depression during adulthood under conditions of social stress. This relationship was examined in a large sample of homeless adults (n = 1849). Subjects with evidence of severe mental disorders such as schizophrenia were excluded. Those with out-of-home care (e.g., foster, group, or institutional care) during childhood were significantly more likely than those without such care to report current severe depressive symptoms (CES-D score greater than or equal to 30). The finding, which held up in multivariate analysis when potential confounders were statistically controlled, supports the theory that certain developmental experiences are risk factors for subsequent depressive symptoms.

T1  - Homeless mentally disordered defendants: competency to stand trial and mental status findings.

A1  - Harmon, R B
Y1  - 1994//
N2  - This study examines relationships between homelessness and findings of incompetency to stand trial in a sample of mentally disordered offenders. All 263 defendants referred for competency evaluation over a six-month period by the Criminal and Supreme Courts in Manhattan were studied. Each defendant was evaluated by two forensic psychiatrists using a structured interview protocol. After removing "false-positive" referrals, 42 percent of the mentally disordered defendants referred to this setting were found to have been homeless at the time of their instant offense, making them more than 40 times more likely to be homeless than the general population and 21 times more likely to be homeless than the rest of the city's mentally ill population. Homeless mentally disordered defendants were significantly more likely to be found incompetent to stand trial than domiciled defendants (p < .007) but also presented with significantly higher levels of psychopathology. Examination of mental status findings revealed that homeless defendants were more likely to be psychotic, including a higher incidence of formal thought disorder and ideas of reference. The relationship between homelessness and incompetency seems to be mediated by psychotic symptoms, suggesting that these defendants are not being found incompetent because they are homeless, but that homeless defendants are more likely to be psychotic and to exhibit a greater degree of psychopathology. The clinical and public policy implications of these findings are discussed.

N2  - One hundred homeless schizophrenic men and 100 never homeless schizophrenic men were compared in terms of symptom ratings on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), which yields a positive, negative, and general psychopathology scale score, as well as evaluated on a number of other variables. The homeless group obtained significantly higher ratings on the PANSS positive and general psychopathology scales, but the two groups did not differ on the PANSS negative scale score. When symptom patterns for subsets of patients who did not abuse illicit substances or alcohol (N = 23 for homeless, N = 56 for nonhomeless) and who were compliant with medication (N = 63 for homeless, N = 82 for nonhomeless) were examined, the higher ratings on the positive and general psychopathology scales failed to achieve statistical significance, while the absence of between-group differences on the negative scale was maintained. Our results suggest that severity of positive and general psychopathology symptoms, but not of negative symptoms, predicts homelessness in schizophrenia and that illicit substance abuse and neuroleptic noncompliance contributed, at least in part, to our higher positive and general psychopathology symptom ratings in the homeless sample. Our findings underscore the need to undertake prospective longitudinal studies to unravel the multifactorial etiology of homelessness in schizophrenia.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Homeless persons have an increased risk of HIV infection because of a high prevalence of HIV-related risk behaviors. These include drug use, sexual contact with persons at risk for HIV infection, and the exchange of sex for drugs. The objectives of this investigation were to describe HIV seroprevalence rates in homeless adults and runaway youth., METHODS: In 1989, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began collaboration with state and local health departments to conduct HIV seroprevalence surveys in homeless populations. Unlinked HIV seroprevalence surveys were conducted in 16 sites; 11 provided medical services primarily to homeless adults, and five to runaway youth aged < 25 years., RESULTS: From January 1989 through December 1992, annual surveys were conducted in 16 sites in 14 cities. Site-specific seroprevalence rates ranged from 0-21.1% (median, 3.3%). Among homeless adults in three sites, rates were higher among men who had sex with other men and those who injected drugs than among persons with other risk exposures (28.9 versus 5.3%). In general, rates were higher for heterosexual men than for women and higher among African Americans than whites. In sites providing services to homeless youth, HIV seroprevalence rates ranged from 0-7.3% (median, 2.3%)., CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that HIV infection among homeless adults and runaway youth is an important public health problem. HIV prevention and treatment should be integrated into comprehensive health and medical programs serving homeless populations.

T1  - Street youth in substance abuse treatment: characteristics and treatment compliance.
A1  - Smart, R G
A1  - Ogborne, A C
Y1  - 1994//
N2  - This study reports on the characteristics of street youth in treatment in Ontario. Data came from eleven substance abuse treatment programs. It was found that street youth in treatment had a larger number of social and drug abuse problems than did non-street youth. They were more likely to be unemployed, on welfare, and to have legal problems. They had more depression and lower self-esteem, and use more alcohol and drugs. Discharged street and non-street youth had similar lengths of stay and drop-out rates in one residential program and similar, although limited, amounts of treatment in outpatient programs. However, street youth were more likely to leave outpatient programs without telling staff. The need for more experimentation in the provision of service for youth is identified.

T1  - Cocaine babies: a result of multiple teratogenic influences.
A1  - Snodgrass, S R
Y1  - 1994//
N2  - The history of cocaine use is reviewed. Cocaine teratogenesis has only recently been studied, and initial human studies had serious methodological flaws. These flaws included ascertainment bias, publication bias (studies finding cocaine effects have been more likely to be presented or published), and overemphasis on the perinatal period. Comparison with alcohol teratogenesis shows that alcohol is a more potent teratogen, which, however, produces major and specific effects (fetal alcohol syndrome) in less than 10% of offspring with heavy alcohol exposure during pregnancy. Nonspecific minor congenital anomalies or fetal alcohol effects are seen in a larger number. Personal experience with two groups of children exposed to cocaine in utero is reviewed. Insurance patients gained weight, took vitamins, and generally, their children did well in spite of cocaine use. Indigent patients were usually unmarried and often "street people," probably used more cocaine, generally used other drugs as well, often did not gain weight during pregnancy, and were much more likely to have children with problems. Surveys show that most cocaine users also use alcohol, often simultaneously. Those who use both agents are more likely to have troubled backgrounds and antisocial behavior and to drop out of treatment programs than those who use only alcohol. Cocaethylene or ethylbenzoylecgonine is formed in the liver when cocaine and alcohol are simultaneously ingested. It is a potent stimulant and dopamine uptake blocker that is more toxic to myocardial cells than is cocaine. Good nutrition is now known to be very important in preventing congenital anomalies and fetal death. A multihit model of neurologic handicap, which stresses the importance of a good postnatal environment, is briefly outlined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Y1  - 1993//
N2  - This article describes the frequency of possible risk factors that emerged during a cross-cultural study of psychosocial response to sexual assault among African-American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white women presenting for treatment at a major urban rape treatment center. Of 881 victims screened, 51% had no observable risk factors while 49% fell into categories of variables that previous research has associated with increased vulnerability. Included were mental disability (psychiatric or developmental), a prior history of rape or incest, tourist or visitor status (site unfamiliarity), and homelessness. Ethnic groups differed significantly in these categories, suggesting socioeconomic and cultural variables that may affect rape statistics and that should be taken into account in rape prevention programs in the community.

N2  - Examined the relations between adolescent boys' social goals of dominance, revenge, avoidance, and affiliation and (1) self-reported negative adolescent outcomes; (2) subjective sense of self-esteem; and (3) externalizing, internalizing, and prosocial behaviors, as rated by peers and teachers. Results indicated that social goal values were related to diverse aspects of self-, teacher-, and peer-reported social and behavioral functioning, with a consistent association found between a range of delinquent, substance-using, and behavioral difficulties, and endorsement of high goal values for dominance and revenge and low goal values for affiliation. Results also indicated that teacher-identified aggressive boys differed from nonaggressive boys in the value they placed on social goals, with aggressive boys placing a higher value on goals of dominance and revenge, and lower value on goals for affiliation. Finally social goal choice had a clear relation to the social problem-solving differences of aggressive and nonaggressive boys.

T1  - Alcohol, drugs, and psychiatric comorbidity among homeless women: an epidemiologic study.

Y1  - 1993//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Very little is known about the mental health of homeless women. The present study is one of the first to focus on psychiatric diagnosis and comorbidity in a population of homeless women systematically interviewed with a structured instrument., METHOD: Three hundred homeless women randomly selected from St. Louis shelters were interviewed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS)., RESULTS: The population of homeless women in St. Louis is predominantly young adult, single, and black; most have young children and average nearly a high school education. Schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder account for only a small portion of the mental illness in these women. Nearly one in three has a history of substance abuse, with drug abuse being more prevalent than alcoholism. One third of the sample met lifetime criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder. One fourth of the women have received inpatient psychiatric care, and the majority with a nonsubstance Axis I diagnosis have received some mental health treatment., CONCLUSION: Although major mental illness is overrepresented among these homeless women, the majority do not suffer from major mental illness. Despite the severity of the stressors these women face, the large numbers escaping psychiatric disorders speak to their resilience and to the likelihood that important factors other than mental illness contribute to their homelessness. Future studies to examine positive outcomes and investigate protective factors might provide a valuable source of information on coping with the stresses associated with homelessness and point to more effective interventions.

T1  - Psychological maladjustment among homeless adolescents.
A1  - Schweitzer, R D
A1  - Hier, S J
Y1  - 1993//
N2  - The prevalence of psychological maladjustment in homeless adolescents (n = 54) was compared to a control group (n = 58) in Brisbane, Australia using the Youth Self-Report Scale. Overall, 74% of the homeless group and 22.4% of the control group scored within the clinical range on one or more of the clinical subscales. There was considerable diversity of symptomatology in the homeless group. Less than half of the homeless group were within the clinical range on both the delinquent subscale and the thought disorder subscale. Depressive, Aggressive and Somatic Complaints were also prevalent. The study challenges preconceived notions of a simple relationship between adolescent homelessness and delinquency, and draws attention to the psychological needs of this group of adolescents.

T1  - Gender, ethnic group, and homelessness as predictors of locus of control among job training participants.
A1  - Wenzel, S L
Y1  - 1993//
N2  - The effect of gender, ethnicity, and homelessness on the locus of control orientations of 113 participants in a job training program in the United States was investigated. It was expected that homeless women of color (Black and Hispanic) would have the strongest perception that powerful others influenced their lives. The Black participants tended to believe more strongly in the influence of chance and powerful others than the White participants did.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiologic and clinical features of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children and their families. PATIENTS AND CLINICAL SETTING: Sixty families of children with HIV infection, children of HIV indeterminate status, and seroreverters underwent follow-up in a comprehensive multidisciplinary program for children and families., METHODS: Infection with M tuberculosis was diagnosed based on a positive Mantoux test result or a positive culture., RESULTS: Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection was diagnosed in seven children (three infected with HIV, three seroreverters, and one uninfected sibling of an infected child) from four families (6%). All infections were detected in the period from March 1990 through January 1992. Six of seven children had a history of exposure to M tuberculosis in an HIV-infected adult (parent) who was an intravenous drug user, homeless, and/or noncompliant with the medical regimen. All HIV-infected children and one seroreverter had pulmonary tuberculosis. One child died of complications of tuberculosis and HIV infection. The M tuberculosis isolated from this child was resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, and streptomycin sulfate., CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis is a growing problem among inner-city children born to HIV-infected parents. Children infected with HIV in this study had symptomatic and severe disease with tuberculosis, which reflected the drug susceptibility pattern of M tuberculosis seen in our community.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To better understand the strengths and weaknesses of systems of services for seriously mentally ill individuals in Canada and the United States, the quality and cost of services in the province of British Columbia (population 3.2 million) were compared with those of services in the 50 states., METHODS: A survey of selected psychiatric facilities, data from the Canadian Ministry of Health, and information from families and consumers were assessed using methods similar to those used in a 1990 survey that rated services for individuals with serious mental illness in the 50 states. Separate scores were given for hospitals, outpatient and community support services, rehabilitation services, housing, and children's services., RESULTS: British Columbia scored higher than any single state in the United States and more than twice as high as 40 states on the quality of services for seriously mentally ill individuals. Compared with the states, British Columbia ranked ninth in cost of services per capita. When ratings of quality and cost were combined, British Columbia appeared to be delivering services almost twice as good as those in New York State at about half the cost. However, recent trends, such as shortages of inpatient beds and increasing numbers of seriously mentally ill persons among the homeless population, suggest that British Columbia's services may be deteriorating., CONCLUSIONS: Probable reasons for the superior services for seriously mentally ill individuals in British Columbia include single-source funding, a strong mandate to treat such individuals, and a comprehensive approach to providing services. The Canadian health system, as implemented in British Columbia, has definite advantages for individuals with serious mental illnesses.

T1  - Self-administered questionnaire for structured psychosocial screening in pediatrics.
A1  - Kemper, K J
Y1  - 1992//
N2  - Screening for psychosocial risk factors has been limited by lack of a structured approach. The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of a self-administered questionnaire compared with routine history as recorded in the medical record in screening for risk factors for dysfunctional parenting in an urban pediatric clinic. English-speaking parents were offered questionnaires in the waiting room. In addition to routine demographic and medical questions, the questionnaires contained standard screening instruments for substance abuse, depression, self-esteem, and social support, as well as questions about domestic violence, homelessness, and parental history of abuse as a child. Medical records were reviewed separately. Of the 114 mothers who returned questionnaires, the response rate for sensitive questions such as income was greater than or equal to 85%. Compared with the medical record, the questionnaire identified significantly more mothers with possible substance abuse, depression, low self-esteem, and/or history of abuse as a child (P less than .01 for each). Compared with what is usually recorded in the medical record, self-administered questionnaires yield substantial additional information regarding psychosocial risk factors for dysfunctional parenting. Such questionnaires should be considered for routine psychosocial screening in clinics serving high-risk populations.

T1  - Comparative study of factors relating to HIV risk level of black homeless women.
A1  - Nyamathi, A
Y1  - 1992//
N2  - A comparative study was conducted to assess factors that relate to level of HIV risk of black homeless women. The study examined whether 460 black women categorized as high, moderate, or low risk for HIV infection differed in environmental, demographic, and personal factors; appraisal of threat; resources; coping responses; and health outcome. Multivariate analyses of variance revealed high-risk homeless women reported statistically significant and greater concerns, appraisal of threat, emotion-focused coping, depression, and emotional distress, as well as less self-esteem and sense of coherence than moderate- and low-risk homeless women. Discriminant analyses revealed that women at high risk for HIV infection were best differentiated from moderate- and low-risk women by greater use of emotion-focused coping, greater severity of concerns, greater depression, and less self-esteem. An understanding of psychosocial factors most predictive of groups at highest risk for HIV infection provides impetus for interventional programs focused on altering the course of the disease in this population.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The authors examined the conservatorship process in California by studying a group of psychiatric patients for whom conservatorship was sought; their goal was to determine its effectiveness both during and after the period of conservatorship., METHOD: The subjects were 60 county psychiatric hospital inpatients 18-60 years old for whom temporary (30-day) conservatorships were obtained and who were followed for 4 years. The patients' courses over the 4 years were assessed in terms of whether 1-year conservatorships were obtained, stability (number and length of psychiatric hospitalizations, arrests, serious physical violence, and homelessness), and presence or absence of family support., RESULTS: The patients proved to be a severely mentally ill and disabled group. Thirty-five (58%) were granted a 1-year conservatorship sometime during the 4-year study period, and 25 (42%) were not. Both family support and conservatorship appeared to be related to the patients' stability. When one or both were present, there was a significantly greater likelihood of stability., CONCLUSIONS: The authors believe that for a considerable number of chronically and severely mentally ill individuals, conservatorship would play an important role in their clinical management and treatment by helping to eliminate their chaotic life styles, their cycle of admission and discharge from hospitals and jails, and/or their living on the streets, particularly when family support is absent.

T1  - Glue sniffing: a comparison study of sniffers and non-sniffers.
A1  - Jansen, P

A1  - Griesel, R D
Y1  - 1992//
N2  - A study of 22 glue sniffers and 22 non-sniffers was carried out with individuals from the same reference group. The subjects were all street children living in supervised shelters. No statistically significant differences were found between the sniffers and non-sniffers on cognitive measures or biographical features (e.g. time spent at school, years on the street). When rated by shelter staff on a modified version of the Christiansen Rating Scale (1967) the sniffers were perceived to be significantly more disturbed in their relationships with others, however, methodological issues do not permit conclusive evidence of behavioural differences to be drawn. The authors conclude that the findings lend support for the view that the effects of volatile substance abuse on cognitive and personality functioning cannot be clearly demonstrated.

N2  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim was to test the assumption that mass miniature x ray screening of the single homeless (hostel residents) is a cost-effective means of controlling pulmonary tuberculosis., DESIGN: The study was a prospective experimental screening exercise to identify new cases of active tuberculosis completing treatment., SETTING: The setting was eight hostels in south London. A mobile x ray screening facility was set up outside the hostels., SUBJECTS: Subjects were 547 single homeless residents in the hostels. They were encouraged to attend for chest x ray, and for active follow up of abnormal x rays., MAIN RESULTS: No new cases of active tuberculosis were found., CONCLUSIONS: Mass miniature x ray is ineffective in controlling tuberculosis because of its unacceptability and increasing inaccessibility to this population.

N2  - The association between presumed protective factors and social risk factors for hospitalization and mortality was studied during a 14-year follow-up period in a cohort of 8,168 Swedish men aged 18-20 years at baseline. Using Cox regression analysis, the authors found that five protective factors (high social class, home well-being, school well-being, good emotional control, and self-perceived good health) were associated with lower risks of hospitalization and death. Four social risk factors (contact with police or child welfare authorities, running away from home, having divorced parents, and ever using narcotics) were significantly associated with increased risk of hospitalization and mortality. The relative hazard decreased with the number of protective factors and increased with the number of social risk factors, almost linearly. The relative hazard was 0.24 for hospitalization among those with six protective factors and 0.24 for mortality for those with five or six protective factors. The relative hazard for hospitalization was 3.09 among those with five social risk factors compared with those with none, while for mortality the relative hazard among those with four or five social risk factors was 5.74 compared with those with none. While these results indicate strong cumulative effects for both the social risk factors and the protective factors, the associations of individual factors with the two outcome measures were generally reduced in models which simultaneously adjusted for all factors, which presumably indicates collinearity among the factors. There was only limited support for a buffering, or interacting, effect between the risk factors and the protective factors.

N2  - 1. Nurses can use research findings to educate other health professionals about homeless subcultures with attention to specific cultural and socioeconomic needs, as well as to develop interventions for homeless women. 2. Minority women are more susceptible to homelessness as they experience increased poverty levels and are often single mothers. Of all minority women, African-American women are the most vulnerable to physical and psychological illness. 3. In this study, 75% of the subjects had scores on a psychological assessment test that indicated they needed additional psychological testing.

N2  - Children living in homeless shelters often lack the health care resources usually available to other children. They are often more acutely and chronically ill than domiciled children and frequently use the emergency department (ED) as their point of entry into the health care system. To identify differences in health status, we surveyed sheltered children and domiciled controls during a nine-month period in our ED. One hundred sixty-two families completed a self-administered questionnaire during the study period: 54 homeless and 108 age-matched controls. Mean patient age was 3.4 years, mean maternal age was 27 years in both groups, and average time spent in shelters was 7.8 months. Shelter families had more children, more single mothers, and higher rates of unemployment and uninsurance than did control families. Shelter children showed greater frequencies of immunization delay, lack of TB testing, and lack of a regular health care site and higher rates of medical admissions from the ED. These data show that children in shelters have limited personal, financial, and medical resources and suggest that there are significant disparities in health status. These patients need to be identified when they present to the ED in order to meet subtle, as well as obvious, health needs.

N2  - In 1989 through 1990, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1437 homeless adults in northern California (98% response rate). Prevalences of alcohol abuse, illegal drug use, and psychiatric hospitalization when adults first became homeless were 15% to 33% lower than prevalences following homelessness. The largest differences between the homeless and a comparison group of 3122 nonhomeless adults were for psychiatric hospitalization (odds ratios [ORs] of 4.6 for men and 5.9 for women) and alcohol abuse (ORs of 2.3 for men and 4.0 for women). However, when prehomeless prevalences of addictive and psychiatric disorders were compared with prevalences among the nonhomeless, absolute differences were no greater than 12%.

T1  - Using after-shelter case management to improve outcomes for families with children.
A1  - Helvie, C O
A1  - Alexy, B B
Y1  - 1992//
N2  - Homelessness and living in shelters have complex and multiple adverse effects on children that lend urgency to assisting families with children to leave shelters and to achieve independent and stable living arrangements. Some shelters offer only short-term housing with no additional support services. Others offer long stays with a comprehensive range of social and economic support services. While living in a shelter, families are faced with such major challenges as finding employment that is adequate to meeting the family's financial needs and locating permanent housing. Because shelter or street living may exacerbate children's health and developmental problems, families with children should move from them into a stable home situation as quickly as possible. The researchers examined some of the specific effects of living in a shelter for homeless families with children in Virginia Beach, VA. They focused on whether the policy of offering families after-shelter case management services for 1 year decreased their average length of the time in the shelter, and whether case management of families with children for 1 year after leaving a shelter increased the proportion of families who obtained permanent housing. A non experimental descriptive design was used. In case management after the shelter stay, an advisor worked intensively with families, helping to locate resources and serving as a resource link, assisting with application processes, providing transportation when necessary, and acting as advocate and support person. Some families needed minimal assistance, while others needed more intensive assistance. The findings suggest that case management services for families following discharge from a homeless shelter effectively reduces the length of stay ina shelter and increases housing stability after discharge from the shelter. For this sample, the average shelter stay was reduced from 31.1 to 22.8 days.

T1  - Health status of the temporarily homeless population and residents of North West Thames region.
A1  - Victor, C R
Y1  - 1992//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: To survey the health status of the temporarily homeless population of North West Thames region and make comparisons with regional residents., DESIGN: Direct interview with standardised questionnaires., SETTING: Temporarily homeless people resident in hotels in the London boroughs in the North West Thames region and a random sample of regional residents., SUBJECTS: 137 hotels thought to be providing accommodation to homeless people selected at random from a list of 295. 113 (82%) participated in the study, and 319 (61%) of 522 homeless people approached participated. The study was restricted to adults aged 16 and over selected at random., RESULTS: The homeless population was predominantly female (195/319; 61%), young (229 (72%) aged 16-34), and poor, 54% (172/319) receiving income support. 207 subjects (65%) had dependent children aged 16 and under. Rates of acute illness among homeless people (32 cases; 10%) were similar to those reported by regional residents. The prevalence of longstanding limiting illness (108 cases; 34%) was similar to that for regional residents, but the prevalence of mental morbidity was twice that for the region as a whole (145 cases (45%) v 1485 (18%)). Utilisation of general practitioner services, accident and emergency departments, and inpatient admission was much higher by the homeless population than by regional residents. General practitioner registration rates were above 90% for the homeless sample., CONCLUSIONS: Survey data provide empirical evidence about the nature and characteristics of the temporarily homeless population. The high service utilisation recorded may, in part, have resulted from the higher morbidity in this sample of homeless people. The concentration of homeless people into specific locations may suggest that additional funding should be provided to the district which provides care to this group. However, such funding should not necessarily be used for additional acute care but should be used to purchase appropriate services which meet the health needs of this very young, poor and vulnerable group.

N2  - Homeless 3-12-year-old children residing in city shelters were compared with a matched control group of 45 inner city children in terms of cognitive functioning and emotional-behavioral adjustment. School-age children in both groups did not differ significantly on most measures. Preschool homeless children exhibited slower development and more emotional-behavioral problems than did their domiciled peers, and significantly fewer were enrolled in early childhood programs. The feasibility of evaluating this population on standardized instruments is demonstrated, and implications of the study for social policy are discussed.

Y1  - 1991//
N2  - Problems related to homeless/runaway youths have received increased attention in recent years. Homeless/runaway youths manifest many problems in addition to being absent from home and without supervision of a parent or guardian. The purpose of the study was to determine drug use and abuse patterns of homeless/runaway youths and to compare those patterns, along with attitudes toward selected illicit behaviors, with similar data collected from adolescents in school. Data were collected from persons (n = 253) in homeless/runaway shelters in the southeast United States. Comparisons made with data from other studies of runaways and of youths in school indicate that drug use and abuse is two-three times more prevalent for runaways than with the school youths. Runaways' attitudes toward selected illicit behaviors are more tolerant than those of school youths. Intervention programs for runaway/homeless youths should reflect an understanding of the complexity of the psycho-social and behavioral history of the clients which is much different than that of those who are in school.

Y1  - 1991//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey was to estimate the prevalence of severe mental disorders in a representative sample of sentenced prisoners., METHOD: The subjects were selected as a random sample of sentenced prisoners in Melbourne's three metropolitan prisons. Interviews were conducted with 158 men and 31 women. Clinicians used the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID) to diagnose psychotic, affective, and substance use disorders., RESULTS: Six prisoners (3%) received current diagnoses of psychotic disorders, and 23 (12%) were diagnosed as having current mood disorders, mainly major depression. A lifetime diagnosis of at least one mental disorder each was made for 82% of the respondents, and in 26% more than one lifetime disorder was diagnosed. Sixty-nine percent received lifetime diagnoses of dependence on or abuse of alcohol, other psychoactive substances, or a combination of these., CONCLUSIONS: These findings do not indicate a large-scale shift of deinstitutionalized psychotically ill people from mental hospitals to prisons. They do, however, highlight the diversion into the corrections system of substance-dependent people and the apparent pool of prisoners with largely untreated major depression.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Reductions in runaways' sexual risk behaviors were evaluated in response to an intensive program to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)., DESIGN: In a nonrandomized control trial, sexual risk behaviors among 78 runaways at one residential shelter who received up to 30 HIV/AIDS intervention sessions were compared with 67 runaways at a nonintervention shelter with sexual behaviors assessed at baseline and 3 and 6 months., SETTING: Runaways were recruited from the only two publicly funded shelters in New York, NY., PARTICIPANTS: The runaways were aged 11 to 18 years, 64% female, and predominantly black or Hispanic., INTERVENTION: The intervention addressed general knowledge about HIV/AIDS, coping skills, access to health care and other resources, and individual barriers to safer sex., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Consistent condom use, a high-risk pattern of sexual behavior, and sexual abstinence over a 3-month time frame were assessed., MAIN RESULTS: As the number of intervention sessions increased, runaways' reports of consistent condom use increased significantly (at 3 months, unique R2 = .06, P less than .05; at 6 months, unique R2 = .09, P less than .05), and their reports of engaging in a high-risk pattern of sexual behavior decreased significantly (at 3 months, unique R2 = .03, P = .06; at 6 months, unique R2 = .04, P less than .05). Abstinence did not change., CONCLUSIONS: The demonstrated effectiveness of the intensive HIV/AIDS program highlights the importance of enlarging the scope of most current HIV/AIDS prevention programs.

N2  - The main purpose of this article is to evaluate the incidence of alcoholism in three different groups from the poor segments of the population. Two types of questionnaires--CAGE and SADD--were applied to 334 men. Incidence of alcoholism in each group was: group I--134 homeless men, without a regular job, sheltered in a public institution, 55.9%; group II--106 unskilled male workers, working in construction sites, 43.4%; group III--94 unskilled male workers, working for a public institution, 23.4%. Results show a very high incidence of alcoholism in these segments of the Brazilian population.

N2  - All initial visits (n = 620) of runaway/homeless youths to an outpatient medical clinic over a 12-month period (July 1988-June 1989) were analyzed. Of these visits, 467 made by youth not involved in prostitution were compared with 153 visits by youth who were involved. According to the data from an adolescent risk profile interview, homeless youth involved in prostitution are at greater risk for a wide variety of medical problems and health-compromising behaviors, including drug abuse, suicide, and depression. The implications for public health and social policy are discussed.

T1  - Street youth: adaptation and survival in the AIDS decade.
A1  - Luna, G C
Y1  - 1991//
N2  - This article discusses adaptational and survival strategies of homeless youth and describes how pilot research, begun in 1982 on these strategies in the western United States, led to additional research and activity focused upon the related international street youth problem. The results of this research suggest that a critical relationship exists between survival strategies and the AIDS pandemic. The impact of this pandemic on street youth can be mitigated only by immediate and comprehensive preventive actions at both national and international levels.

T1  - Runaway and street youth at risk for HIV infection: legal and ethical issues in access to care.
A1  - English, A
Y1  - 1991//
N2  - Significant numbers of runaway and street youth are at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. These youth are physically, socially, and psychologically vulnerable and need access to health care and related services. Legal and ethical concerns of consent and confidentiality may limit their access, although in many states the law allows some minors to consent to HIV testing and treatment and protects confidentiality of HIV-related information. Appropriate pretest and posttest counseling and follow-up for youth at risk of infection are essential. Limited access to HIV treatment for youth testing positive raises serious ethical concerns. Access to comprehensive treatment is currently limited by lack of adequate financing, despite a patchwork of numerous public funding sources providing some coverage for treatment of HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Research studies and clinical trials are critical elements in the planning and delivery of HIV-related services to adolescents, but require consideration of special ethical and legal concerns.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To characterise the pregnant homeless population booking and delivering at St Mary's Hospital, London, and ascertain whether their obstetric outcome was adversely affected by their homeless condition., DESIGN: Retrospective comparison of demographic characteristics of 185 homeless women booking for delivery with those of housed women booking in the same period and with the population of North West Thames region; comparison of obstetric performance of homeless women with subgroup of the housed population (group matched for age, parity, and ethnic origin)., SETTING: Consultant obstetric unit, St Mary's Hospital, London., SUBJECTS: All women booking between April 1987 and March 1988 who subsequently had a registrable birth., MAIN RESULTS: 185 (8%) Of the 2308 women studied were homeless. Compared with the housed population, they had a larger proportion of young women, women of high parity, and Indo-Pakistani women and a smaller proportion of primiparas. Homeless women booked later and had had more previous obstetric problems than housed women. Pregnancy outcome (assessed by birth weight and prematurity rates) was worse than that of both women housed locally and the regional population. Antenatal attendance, complications, intrapartum performance, and perinatal outcome of homeless women did not differ from those in the control group., CONCLUSIONS: This study has been unable to show any significant differences in the outcome of pregnancy in homeless women that can be directly attributed to living in bed and breakfast accommodation, but these women have sociodemographic characteristics and obstetric risk factors that contribute to a poorer outcome in pregnancy than for the general population.

N2  - We studied 196 homeless and 194 housed poor families in Los Angeles, California to gain an understanding of events that precipitate family homelessness. Both homeless and housed poor mothers averaged 29 years old and were accompanied by two or three children. Three-fourths of both the homeless and housed families had income below the poverty level, and both groups expended almost two-thirds of their income on housing. Mothers in homeless families more commonly reported spousal abuse (35 vs 16 percent), child abuse (28 vs 10 percent), drug use (43 vs. 30 percent), or mental health problems (14 vs 6 percent) and weaker support networks. Homeless mothers more commonly came from homes where their parents abused drugs or alcohol (49 vs 34 percent) or more commonly lived outside the home or in foster care (35 vs 25 percent). Homelessness was reported as due primarily to economic pressures of housing costs, but personal and family problems frequently played a contributing role, especially for single parent families. Burdens of increasing housing costs and family dysfunction among housed poor families place many at risk for homelessness.

N2  - A study conducted in Brisbane, Queensland, assessed homeless youths' knowledge, attitudes and behaviours relating to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Data obtained from 40 homeless youths aged 15 to 19 years were compared with that from controls. The findings identified a significantly lower level of accurate knowledge of AIDS by the homeless youth on questions related to the transmission of AIDS and on measures to prevent infection. Furthermore, homeless youth exhibited higher levels of at-risk behaviours for the contraction of AIDS. No significant differences regarding attitudes and beliefs about the disease were found. A subgroup of particularly high-risk youth is identified and described. Given the established knowledge deficits, homeless youth were also assessed for educational measures to which they might respond favourably. Implications for future educational programmes are described. It is concluded that homeless youth are comparatively ignorant of AIDS and comparatively at risk of contracting the disease.

N2  - The association between problem behaviors and parental status was studied in a national sample of urban (n = 1263) and rural (n = 388) young women 15 to 17 years of age. When assessed according to age at childbearing, there was a clear association between problem behavior and the birth of a first child prior to age 19 years. The three parental status groups studied appeared ordered in risk, with school-aged mothers having engaged in the most problem behaviors, and followed, in turn, by young adult mothers (ie, those who had a child between 19 and 21 years of age), and then by women who had not had a child by age 21 years. Young urban women who engaged in three or more problem behaviors were more likely than women who claimed no involvement in problem behaviors to subsequently have a child prior to age 19 years. In addition, black adolescents reported fewer problem behaviors than did white adolescents. When individual behaviors were analyzed, school-aged mothers were more likely than either young adult mothers or nonmothers to have reported school suspension, truancy, runaway, smoking marijuana, and fighting. Although similar results were found in both samples, the effects appeared more consistent for young urban women. In future studies, researchers must determine whether adolescent mothers are at risk for parenting difficulties because of their previous involvement in problem behaviors.

Y1  - 1990//
N2  - A sample of 223 adolescents who sought services from runaway and homeless youth programs in New York State during 1986-1987 was identified as having a history of maltreatment. A demographic profile is presented and the nature of their maltreatment described. The majority of these youth were female and between 15-16 years of age. Less than 25% came from intact families and one-third were born to single mothers. Of the sample, 60% had allegedly experienced physical abuse, 42% emotional abuse, 48% neglect, and 21% sexual abuse. Over one-third were "pushed out" of their homes by their families. Biological mothers were the most frequently cited perpetrators of maltreatment (63%), followed by biological fathers (45%). The sample of maltreated runaways is compared to both statewide and national samples of runaway and homeless youth with regard to their demographic characteristics and the problems they present to staff at intake (e.g., depression, substance abuse, etc.). Youth in the maltreated sample were more likely to be female and were more likely to have engaged in suicidal behavior. Otherwise, the maltreated runaways were not readily distinguished from the runaway and homeless youth population at large.

T1  - Psychosocial characteristics of homeless children and children with homes.
A1  - Bassuk, E L
A1  - Rosenberg, L
Y1  - 1990//
N2  - A comparison was made of 86 children from 49 homeless Boston families headed by women and 134 children from 81 housed Boston families headed by women. In both groups, the mothers were poor, currently single, and had been receiving welfare payments for long periods. Data were collected from the mothers by personal interview; standardized tests were administered to mothers and children (Denver Developmental Screening Test, Simmons Behavior Checklist, Children's Depression Inventory, Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Child Behavior Checklist. The data indicate that many homeless children and poor children with homes have severe and pressing problems. Among preschool children, a higher proportion of homeless children than poor children with homes had one or more developmental delays (P less than .05), although their scores on the Simmons Behavior Checklist were similar. Among school-aged children, the scores of the homeless children were worse than those of the children with homes on the Children's Depression Inventory, Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, and the Child Behavior Checklist, but only the difference on the Anxiety Scale approached statistical significance (P = .06). Both homeless children and poor children with homes generally had worse scores than most other comparison groups of children. Unless action is taken to improve the lot of all these children, it is likely that many will continue to have significant problems that will seriously hamper their ability to function.

N2  - The authors describe a group of pregnant psychiatric patients admitted to a psychiatric service in an urban hospital. A high rate of involuntary admission (44%), homelessness (36%), and substance abuse (64%) was noted. In this group of high-risk obstetric patients, we identified risk factors associated with noncompliance with ongoing prenatal care. Brief psychiatric hospitalization can be an important aspect in improving obstetric outcome by providing an opportunity to collect obstetric information and promote ongoing prenatal care.

T1  - Differences in health status between older and younger homeless adults.

Y1  - 1990//
N2  - The Institute of Medicine has placed a priority on determining the special health-care needs of elderly homeless persons. As part of a community-based study of 521 homeless adults in two beach communities of Los Angeles, we compared the demographic characteristics and health of older (age rangek 50-78, n = 61) and younger (age range, 18-49, n = 460) homeless individuals. Compared with younger adults, older adults were more likely to be white (85% versus 61%), veterans (59% versus 27%), retired (36% versus 3%), and living in a vehicle (21% versus 8%). Older adults were more likely to report having a chronic disease (69% versus 49%), functional disabilities, no informal social contacts during the previous month (49% versus 27%), observed high blood pressure (42% versus 22%), elevated creatinine (11% versus 2%), and elevated cholesterol (57% versus 36%). Older adults were less likely to have a toothache (3% versus 30%), report psychotic symptoms (25% versus 42%), and to be illegal drug users (15% versus 55%). Although they are chronologically younger, the constellation of health and functional problems of older homeless adults resemble those of geriatric persons in the general population. We suggest that geriatricians could play a significant role in training other primary-care providers to evaluate and treat socially isolated older homeless adults in a more comprehensive way than is currently standard in practice (e.g., interdisciplinary team care and emphasis on functional status, rehabilitative medicine, and assessment for sensory impairment).

Y1  - 1990//
N2  - Homeless children in families are increasing in numbers across the country and have been noted to have frequent health problems. The health status of homeless children was assessed on multiple dimensions through parental report in a survey conducted with 196 homeless families in 10 shelters in Los Angeles and 194 housed poor families after March 1987 through January 1988. During the month before the survey, the homeless and housed poor children experienced high rates of illness symptoms, disability, and bed days. Homeless and housed poor children were frequently rated by their parents to be in fair or poor health (17% vs 13%, P = .14). Homeless children, however, were reported to have more behavior problems and school failure [30% vs 18%, P = .06] than housed poor children. Homeless children also had high rates of other health problems such as developmental delay (9%) and overweight (13%). The diets of homeless children were frequently imbalanced, dependent on food from "fast-food" restaurants, and characterized by repeated periods of deprivation. Family problems were more common among homeless families, especially among single-parent homeless families compared with single-parent housed families (spousal abuse, 68% vs 41%, P less than .01; parental drug and alcohol abuse, 60% vs 39%, P less than .01). It is concluded that homeless children have significant child behavior and developmental problems and disorders of nutrition and growth, which are associated with multiple risk factors in their environment.

N2  - The authors determined the prevalence of mental illness in 382 people representative of the occupants of shelters for the homeless and cheap single-room accommodations in inner-city areas of Melbourne. Clinicians were trained to use a standardized diagnostic instrument, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, to diagnose a range of severe mental disorders, including psychotic, affective, and substance-related disorders. Almost half the people interviewed received diagnoses of current disorders, and over 70% received lifetime diagnoses. There was considerable comorbidity. Many factors are likely to contribute to the concentration of people with mental disorders in such homeless and disaffiliated groups.

N2  - We reviewed the outpatient medical records of 265 homeless children less than 5 years of age in New York City and compared them with children of similar low socioeconomic status (SES) attending the same pediatric clinic. The frequency of health problems among the homeless children, including delayed immunizations, elevated blood lead levels, the rate of admission to hospital, and the rate of child abuse and neglect reports, exceeded those for the comparison groups.

Y1  - 1988//
N2  - A chart review and telephone interview of 72 sexual abuse victims was conducted to determine if children and adolescents who are victims of sexual abuse suffer from symptoms similar to the "rape trauma syndrome," which has been reported in adults. Symptoms similar to the rape trauma syndrome were found in 48 of the 72 abused children and only 26 of the matched control group, p less than .01. Common somatic complaints in the sexual abuse patients included dysuria, vaginal discharge and chronic abdominal pain. Some of the emotional and behavioral problems noted during the follow-up period among the sexual abuse patients included sleep problems, runaway behavior, and suicide attempts. The duration of abuse and age of the victim at the time of abuse significantly affected the frequency of reported somatic symptoms, but the type of abuse and type of assailant did not significantly affect the frequency of reported somatic and emotional reactions. There was no difference in the occurrence of school problems and early pregnancy between sexually abused patients and controls. Since 67% of all sexually abused patients suffered from emotional and somatic reactions, close follow-up of these patients is indicated.

N2  - All initial visits (N = 765) to an outpatient medical clinic during calendar year 1985 were analyzed. Six hundred and fifty-five of these visits made by non-runaway youth were compared to 110 visits made by runaways. Based on data from the Childrens Hospital Adolescent Risk Profile Interview, runaway street youth are at greater risk for a wide variety of medical problems and of health-compromising behaviors including suicide and depression, prostitution, and drug use. The implications for public health and social policy are discussed.

T1  - Why does family homelessness occur? A case-control study.
A1  - Bassuk, E L
A1  - Rosenberg, L
Y1  - 1988//
N2  - We compared 49 homeless female-headed families with 81 housed female-headed families in Boston. Most housed families were living in public or private subsidized housing. In both groups the mothers were poor, currently single, had little work experience, and had been on welfare for long periods. Many of their children had serious developmental and emotional problems. Homeless mothers had more frequently been abused as children and battered as adults and their support networks were fragmented; the housed mothers had female relatives and extended family living nearby whom they saw often. The frequency of drug, alcohol, and serious psychiatric problems was greater among the homeless mothers. The homeless mothers may have been more vulnerable to the current housing shortage because they lacked support in time of need. This, in turn, may have been due to their history of family violence. Psychiatric disabilities may have been another contributing factor in the minority of homeless women. The notion that a "culture of poverty" accounts for homelessness was not supported by the data since the homeless were less likely to have grown up in families on welfare. The data suggest that solutions to family homelessness in the current housing market require an increase in the supply of decent affordable housing, income maintenance, and assistance from social welfare agencies focused on rebuilding supportive relationships.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to determine if there are significant differences between first-time and recidivist runaway residents of a county center for juvenile status offenders. A total of 149 subjects (34 males and 115 females) between the ages of 12 and 16 were administered the Reading section of the High School Personality Questionnaire. Demography data were obtained from each subject's intake interview form. A stepwise multiple discrimination analysis resulted in the selection of 8 variables that discriminate between first-time and recidivist runaways. The 8 discriminant variables characterized the recidivist runaway as an urban, Caucasian youth who has had previous contact with an agency, has stayed at the center an average of 13.6 days, has lower general intelligence, is less objective and less self-sufficient, and is at risk of becoming psychotic or delinquent.

T1  - National differences in psychiatric morbidity: methodological issues, scientific interpretations and social implications.
A1  - Westermeyer, J
Y1  - 1988//
N2  - If national differences in psychiatric morbidity could be established, this information could guide us towards greater understanding of psychopathology and perhaps aid in primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of psychiatric disorders. Obstacles to determining national differences include application of epidemiological concepts in psychiatry, diagnostic criteria and reliability, sampling and data collection problems, and factors affecting rates which are not constant across nations (e.g., mortality associated with psychiatric disorder, migration). Despite these problems, four diagnostic entities are considered from the standpoint of national differences (i.e., schizophrenia, substance abuse, mental retardation, and pathoplastic or "culture bound" disorders). Three examples of social or "supra-diagnostic" problems relevant to national differences in psychiatric morbidity are also addressed: youth as a high risk group, homeless mentally ill, and adversive migration.

T1  - Alcoholism among homeless adults in the inner city of Los Angeles.
A1  - Koegel, P
A1  - Burnam, M A
Y1  - 1988//
N2  - The prevalence, course, and severity of alcoholism were examined in a probability sample of homeless adults in Los Angeles' inner city and in a household sample (drawn from two communities in Los Angeles), matched to the demographic characteristics of the homeless sample. Both lifetime and current prevalence of alcoholism (as measured by the National Institute of Mental Health's Diagnostic Interview Schedule) was substantially higher among homeless individuals. Moreover, compared with household alcoholics, homeless alcoholics were characterized by (1) a substantially higher prevalence of other psychiatric disorders, particularly the major mental illnesses; (2) more severe patterns of drinking, which spanned longer periods of time; and (3) more profoundly affected levels of social and vocational functioning. Homeless alcoholics were also more likely to have entered treatment programs and to have engaged in problem behaviors as children and adults. Emphasis was placed on the complicated etiologic relationship between alcoholism and homelessness, and on the need for alcohol rehabilitation services that are sensitive to the unique situations in which homeless alcoholics find themselves.

N2  - This study assesses whether pregnant Mexican-American adolescents have psychosocial characteristics different from their pregnant white or black peers. The study population consisted of 199 consecutive Mexican-American, white, and black pregnant adolescents, ages 11-19 years, followed prospectively at the University of California San Diego Medical Center Teen Obstetric Clinic from 1978 to 1981 (79 whites, 76 Mexican-Americans, and 44 blacks). Although all three groups had the same chronologic age (X = 16.4 +/- 1.4 years), and the same number of years of schooling, pregnant black adolescents were more likely to be in school at the time of registration for prenatal care (p less than 0.01). Mexican-American teens were more likely to be married at conception and/or delivery (p less than 0.001), and to breastfeed their infants (p less than 0.05). The fathers of the Mexican-American babies were more likely than other fathers to be full-time students or employed (p less than 0.001). Although pregnant Mexican-American teens came from the largest families (p less than 0.001), black teenagers most frequently reported a good mother-daughter relationship (p less than 0.05). White pregnant teens most frequently reported a family history of psychiatric illness (p less than 0.01), parental death (p less than 0.05), or runaway behavior (p less than 0.01). These data suggest that pregnant teenagers from these three racial/ethnic backgrounds have different psychosocial profiles and hence different psychosocial problems and needs.

N2  - Selected mental health and social characteristics of 51 homeless persons drawn as a probability sample from missions are compared to those of 1,338 men aged 18-64 years living in households from the NIMH Epidemiologic Catchment Area survey conducted in Eastern Baltimore. Differences between the two groups were small with respect to age, race, education, and military service but the differences in mental health status, utilization patterns, and social dysfunction were large. About one-third of the homeless scored high on the General Health Questionnaire which measures distress. A similar proportion had a current psychiatric disorder as ascertained by the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS), with the homeless exhibiting higher prevalence rates in every DIS/DSM III diagnostic category compared to domiciled men. Homeless persons reported higher rates of hospitalization than household men for both mental (33 per cent vs 5 per cent) and physical (20 per cent vs 10 per cent) problems but a lower proportion received ambulatory care (41 per cent vs 50 per cent). Social dysfunction among the homeless was indicated by fewer social contacts and higher rates of arrests as adults than domiciled men (58 per cent vs 24 per cent), including multiple arrests (38 per cent vs 9 per cent) and felony convictions (16 per cent vs 5 per cent). Implications of these findings are discussed in terms of research and health policy.

T1  - Runaway youths and sexual victimization: gender differences in an adolescent runaway population.

Y1  - 1986//
N2  - Running away from home has often been viewed as one of the sequelae to sexual abuse. Our study of 144 adolescent runaways finds that 38% of male runaways (n = 89) and 73% of female runaways (n = 55) report having been sexually abused. The impact of abuse is examined by studying, within each gender group, its relationship to the subject's perceptions of sexual activity, relationships with peers and adults, involvement with delinquent/criminal activities, and physical and emotional complaints. The results of assessing the differences between abused and nonabused adolescents show that both the victimized males and females are more likely to report anxiety and suicidal feelings than are their nonabused counterparts. Male victims of sexual abuse are more likely to report physical symptomatology and fear of adult men. Female victims of sexual abuse are more likely to be confused about sex and to engage in delinquent/criminal activities. Discussion focuses on gender differences and runaway behaviors in relation to sexual victimization with the suggestion that differences in the degree of abuse and the sex of the abuser may explain study findings.

N2  - This article reports the findings of a 1984 study evaluating the effectiveness of a well-established residential child-care facility for adolescent boys. Program outcomes for 101 males between the ages of eleven and seventeen were examined in relation to a wide range of demographic, social history, and program participation variables. Characteristics found to be significantly associated with program outcome included: race; probation; drug abuse; program intervention; home visits; and runaway behavior. In a separate analysis, three factors were found to be significantly related to runaway behavior, the chief cause of program failure: race; placement under court supervision; and program intervention.

N2  - A clinico-epidemiological study involved children and adolescents with a history of home abandoning and tramping who live in two administrative districts of a big city. The study was aimed at investigating the prevalence of the dromomania syndrome in the children and adolescents of the given districts, the specification of the nosological and syndromal characteristics of the patients, and eliciting the etiopathogenetic role of various factors (social, communal and biological) in the formation of this syndrome. The findings obtained are indicative of the prevalence of the dromomania syndrome in children and adolescents and of the proportion of various forms of psychic pathology in this patient population. The significance of various factors in the etiopathogenesis of the syndrome was found to vary in different nosological forms.

T1  - Late results of hip and knee surgery in severely handicapped cerebral palsy patients.
A1  - Feldkamp, M
Y1  - 1982//
N2  - Seventy-three involved cerebral palsied patients were reinvestigated 10 or more years after hip and/or knee surgery. The average age was 6.3 years at operation and 18.1 years at retest. The results were evaluated as to motor progress and hip position. While preoperatively none of the patients was independently ambulatory, this was true in 18 cases after surgery. Usually free gait however was insecure (household walking). All patients that had been unable to sit independently before surgery remained strictly wheelchair bound. The results of hip realignment differed according to degree of handicap: In 51 patients with preoperative motor age of 8 months or more 43 hip deformities had been present, that could be improved in 29 items and remained unimproved 14 times, while five new deformities developed. This meant 19 deformed hips in this group of patients. In 22 patients, whose motor age at surgery had been below 8 months, improvement of 30 deformed hips had been possible 25 times, but there were 13 newly developed changes and 5 unimproved, so that 18 hips still were found deformed. There was a marked tendency for a-symmetry after surgery: while the relation of unilateral to bilateral deformities was 21:26 before operation, this changed to 27:5 postoperatively. 15 patients developed scoliosis of more than 25 degree, 11 of them in the group with major handicap (n = 22). Our study stresses the ill prognosis of surgery in mostly handicapped cerebral palsied children.

T1  - An evaluation of Teaching-Family (Achievement Place) group homes for juvenile offenders.

N2  - Juvenile crime is a serious problem for which treatment approach has been found to be reliably effective. This outcome evaluation assessed during and posttreatment effectiveness of Teaching-Family group home treatment programs for juvenile offenders. The evaluation included the original Achievement Place program, which was the prototype for the development of the Teaching-Family treatment approach, 12 replications of Achievement Place, and 9 comparison group home programs. Primary dependent measures were retrieved from court and police files and included number of alleged offenses, percentage of youths involved in those alleged offenses, and percentage of youths institutionalized. Other dependent measures were subjective ratings of effectiveness obtained from the program consumers, including the group home residents. The results showed difference during treatment favoring the Teaching-Family programs on rate of alleged criminal offenses, percentage of youths involved in those offenses, and consumer ratings of the programs. The consumer ratings provided by the youths and their school teachers were found to be inversely and significantly correlated with the reduction of criminal offenses during treatment. There were no significant differences during treatment on measures of noncriminal offenses (e.g., truancy, runaway, and curfew violations). In the posttreatment year, none of the differences between the groups was significant on any of the outcome measures. The results are discussed in terms of measurement and design issues in the evaluation of delinquency treatment programs and in relation to the evaluation; of Teaching-Family group homes by Richard Jones and his colleagues.

N2  - Investigated responses of abused and non-abused juvenile delinquents to Bell's Adjustment Inventory and Gough's California Psychological Inventory, and information with regard to several related behavioral measures. The Ss were 52 institutionalized adolescent males and females. Results indicated that the abused Ss scored significantly higher than the non-abused group on the Home Adjustment Scale (indicative of poorer adjustment) and significantly lower than the non-abused group on the Flexibility, Tolerance, and Socialization Scales. Subsequent analysis showed a significant interaction effect on the behavioral measure with regard to the number of runaway attempts; abused males made significantly more attempts than abused females and non-abused males and females.

A1  - Stang, H J
Y1  - 1977//
N2  - One hundred homeless adolescents were interviewed in 1971 when they still were active drug abusers. The same group was followed-up 3 years later in 1974 with personal interviews. All were traced, with the exception of three individuals residing in foreign countries and four who had died. At follow-up one third were abstinent and were well adapted socially, one third showed an uncertain social adaptation, and one third were still addicted and had a poor social adaptation. The various factors responsible for their psycho-social development and relation to drug abuse are discussed.

T1  - The Imbrication Model for the integration of social services in a community.
A1  - Blakeney, R N
A1  - Bell, E C
A1  - Creson, D L
Y1  - 1976//
N2  - An innovative model for organising social services in a community, the Imbrication Model, is contrasted with two traditional models, the Entrepreneurial and the Umbrella Agency. The structural characteristics and dynamics of the three models are illustrated with actual case histories. Imbrication Model calls for the interlocking of personnel from several agencies, with the purpose of redirecting the dysfunctional interagency rivalry prevalent in the traditional models. Imbrications at all organisational levels--Board of Directors, Administrators and Staff--facilitate adoption of the superordinate goal of providing clients with the best services available, regardless of which particular agency delivers the service. Few observers of the current social service scene would challenge the statement that needs for service are unlimited and resources limited. In the USA the imbalance between needs and resources persists despite a decade of massive governmental programmes intended to alleviate social ills. Recent substantial cutbacks in federal funds, moreover are not likely to improve the situation. The resource shortage involves more than a limitation of funds. Deliverers of service and competent programme administrators are also on critically short supply. These shortages are more often than not exacerbated by a chronic spirit of competition among agencies and programmes at the local level. Three organizational models for the delivery and administration of social services, two conventional and one of more recent date, are examined in this article. The innovative model, which has been named the Imbrication Model, explicitly calls for redirecting interagency rivalry and competition. Its ambitious goal is to integrate the efforts of those attempting to meet a community's social service needs.

N2  - At the University Hospital, Saskatoon, over the last three years, pacemakers have been inserted in 40 patients with complete or incomplete heart block. Fourteen of the patients were females and 26 were males. The average age was 65 years; 12 were over 80 years of age, and the youngest patient was 8 years of age. In none was the heart block due to operation. Thirty-three patients are still alive and well. There have been seven deaths three early and four late. One patient died because of a "runaway" pacemaker, and two as a result of infection persisting around the pacemaker. Twenty-nine Medtronic pacemakers were used and 14 Atricor pacemakers; currently we favour the latter instrument.
