AB  - Economic vulnerability, such as homelessness and unemployment, contributes to HIV risk among U.S. racial minorities. Yet, few economic-strengthening interventions have been adapted for HIV prevention in this population. This study assessed the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial of a 20-week microenterprise intervention for economically-vulnerable African-American young adults. Engaging MicroenterprisE for Resource Generation and Health Empowerment (EMERGE) aimed to reduce sexual risk behaviors and increase employment and uptake of HIV preventive behaviors. The experimental group received text messages on job openings plus educational sessions, mentoring, a start-up grant, and business and HIV prevention text messages. The comparison group received text messages on job openings only. Primary feasibility objectives assessed recruitment, randomization, participation, and retention. Secondary objectives examined employment, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV preventive behaviors. Outcome assessments used an in-person pre- and post-intervention interview and a weekly text message survey. Several progression criteria for a definitive trial were met. Thirty-eight participants were randomized to experimental (n = 19) or comparison group (n = 19) of which 95% were retained. The comparison intervention enhanced willingness to be randomized and reduced non-participation. Mean age of participants was 21.0 years; 35% were male; 81% were unemployed. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of experimental participants completed ≥ 70% of intervention activities, and 74% completed ≥ 50% of intervention activities. Participation in intervention activities and outcome assessments was highest in the first half (~ 10 weeks) of the study. Seventy-one percent (71%) of weekly text message surveys received a response through week 14, but responsiveness declined to 37% of participants responding to ≥ 70% of weekly text message surveys at the end of the study. The experimental group reported higher employment (from 32% at baseline to 83% at week 26) and lower unprotected sex (79% to 58%) over time compared to reported changes in employment (37% to 47%) and unprotected sex (63% to 53%) over time in the comparison group. Conducting this feasibility trial was a critical step in the process of designing and testing a behavioral intervention. Development of a fully-powered effectiveness trial should take into account lessons learned regarding intervention duration, screening, and measurement.Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - Background: The experience of homelessness and child protection involvement pose risks to children's school success. Elucidating processes by which these interrelated systems affect child well-being is important for guiding policy and practice. Objective: This study examines the temporal relation between emergency shelter or transitional housing use and child protection involvement among school-aged children. We evaluated effects of both risk indicators on school attendance and school mobility. Participant and setting: Using integrated administrative data, we identified 3278 children (ages 4 to 15) whose families used emergency or transitional housing in Hennepin and Ramsey County of Minnesota during the 2014 and 2015 academic years. A propensity-score-matched comparison group of 2613 children who did not use emergency or transitional housing. Method: Through a series of logistic regressions and generalized estimating equations, we tested the temporal associations of emergency/transitional housing and child protection involvement as well as how both experiences affected school attendance and mobility. Results: Experiences of emergency or transitional housing often proceeded or occurred concurrently with child protection involvement and increased the likelihood of child protection services. Emergency or transitional housing and child protection involvement posed risks for lower school attendance and greater school mobility. Conclusions: A multisystem approach to assist families across social services may be important for stabilizing children's housing and bolstering their success at school. A two-generation approach focused on residential and school stability and enhancing family resources could boost adaptive success of family members across contexts.

AB  - Objectives Little is known about influences of sample selection on estimation in propensity score matching. The purpose of the study was to assess potential selection bias using one-to-one greedy matching versus optimal full matching as part of an evaluation of supportive housing in New York City (NYC).Study Design and Settings Data came from administrative data for 2 groups of applicants who were eligible for an NYC supportive housing program in 2007–09, including chronically homeless adults with a substance use disorder and young adults aging out of foster care. We evaluated the 2 matching methods in their ability to balance covariates and represent the original population, and in how those methods affected outcomes related to Medicaid expenditures.Results In the population with a substance use disorder, only optimal full matching performed well in balancing covariates, whereas both methods created representative populations. In the young adult population, both methods balanced covariates effectively, but only optimal full matching created representative populations. In the young adult population, the impact of the program on Medicaid expenditures was attenuated when one-to-one greedy matching was used, compared with optimal full matching.Conclusion Given covariate balancing with both methods, attenuated program impacts in the young adult population indicated that one-to-one greedy matching introduced selection bias.

AB  - The phenomenon of girls running away from home is an increasingly widespread social challenge confronted by families, welfare agencies, and governmental organizations in Jeddah, Saudia Arabia. This study compared runaway girls and a control group on various measures and investigated the predictors of runaway behavior among Saudi adolescent girls. A sample of young adolescent girls (N = 77, aged between 14 and 21 years) included a purposive sample of runaways (N = 33), comprised of all the girls living in a social care home in Jeddah who had left their homes at least once, and a control group (N = 44) selected via cluster sampling. The participants were assessed using a demographic questionnaire, the Family Cohesion Scale, and the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction Scale. Inter-group differences were apparent and differences were also found based on the circumplex model. The results of the stepwise discriminant analysis showed six variables (family cohesion, age, education, number of sisters, number of brothers, and birth order) that remained and explained 80.82% of group membership variation. Lack of family cohesion, along with several demographic variables, can lead to complicated emotional attitudes among adolescent girls which trigger runaway behavior. Although runaway youth services must continue to stay focused on safety and short-term residential care, the underlying causal factors must be identified as well.

AB  -  The goal of the current study was to identify potential individual and environmental protective factors for sex risk behavior among homeless youth. We explored gender differences in the prediction of unprotected sex and number of sex partners. Data were collected from 192 sexually active, homeless youth who were 14-21 years old. High rates of sex risk behavior were reported. Significant gender differences were found in STD rates with 19% of females and 2% of males reporting an STD diagnosis during the previous three months. Findings indicated that positive expectations for the future were associated with fewer sex partners for both genders, whereas decision making skills predicted a lower percentage of unprotected sex for males and fewer sex partners for females. For females, univariate analyses indicated that self-esteem and having a natural mentor may reduce the likelihood of unprotected sex, whereas multivariate analysis indicated that being employed or in school may play a protective role with respect to number of sex partners.

AB  - Homeless youth frequently experience victimization, and youth with histories of trauma often fail to detect danger risks, making them vulnerable to subsequent victimization. The current study describes a pilot test of a skills-based intervention designed to improve risk detection among homeless youth through focusing attention to internal, interpersonal, and environmental cues. Youth aged 18 to 21 years (N = 74) were recruited from a shelter and randomly assigned to receive usual case management services or usual services plus a 3-day manualized risk detection intervention. Pretest and posttest interviews assessed youths’ risk detection abilities through vignettes describing risky situations and asking youth to identify risk cues present. Separate 2 (intervention vs. control) × 2 (pretest vs. posttest) mixed ANOVAs found significant interaction effects, as intervention youth significantly improved in overall risk detection compared with control youth. Post hoc subgroup analyses found the intervention had a greater effect for youth without previous experiences of indirect victimization than those with previous indirect victimization experiences.

AB  - Background: Ensuring young people experience good sexual health is a key public health concern, yet some vulnerable groups of young people remain at higher risk of poor sexual health. These individuals require additional support to achieve good sexual health but the best way to provide this remains needs to be better understood. Methods: We searched for randomised controlled trials of behavioural and psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting sexual health in high-risk young populations. Outcomes of interest were indicators of sexual health (e.g., condom use, attitudes to contraception, knowledge of risk). Participants were under 25 years old and in one of the following high-risk groups: alcohol and other drug use; ethnic minority; homeless; justice-involved; LGBTQI+; mental ill-health; or out-of-home care. Results: Twenty-eight papers from 26 trials met our inclusion criteria, with all but one conducted in North America. Condom use was the most frequently reported outcome measure along with knowledge and attitudes towards sexual health but considerable differences in measures used made comparisons across studies difficult. Change in knowledge and attitudes did not consistently result in long-term change in behaviours. Conclusions: There remains a dearth of research undertaken outside of North America across all high-risk groups of young people. Future interventions should address sexual health more broadly than just the absence of negative biological outcomes, with LGBTQI+, homeless and mental ill-health populations targeted for such work. An international consensus on outcome measures would support the research field going forward, making future meta-analyses possible.

AB  - Treatment foster care, an intervention model that offers an alternative to group residential care for serious chronic juvenile offenders is described along with results of a study comparing outcomes for boys who participated in treatment foster care (TFC) and group care (GC) placements. The TFC approach is an extension of the parent-mediated treatments that have previously been shown to be effective in working with children with aggression and antisocial behavior problems. In TFC, community families were recruited and trained to provide placements for study boys. One boy was placed per home. GC boys were placed with 6-15 others with similar delinquency problems. For boys in both conditions, they and their adult caretakers participated in an assessment 3 months after initial placement. The assessment was designed to evaluate key treatment process variables thought to predict later outcomes: the extent to which the boy was well supervised, the level of consistent discipline he received, the extent to which he associated with delinquent peers, and the quality of the boy's relationship with his adult caretaker. Results on these variables are presented, as are results on outcomes: subsequent arrests, program completion rates, rates of running away from placement and number of days incarcerated in follow-up. A brief case study is included to illustrate the TFC treatment approach.

AB  - There are two factors that limit our knowledge of the risk factors associated with homelessness among runaway adolescents, namely (1) the samples used are often composed of youth homeless service users &/or youths living on the streets (visible homelessness), whereas most adolescents in fact use "private" resources (hidden homelessness), & (2) failure to use an adequate control group to identify risk factors associated specifically with homelessness. Our study compares the characteristics of two groups of youths under the supervision of the youth protection system, according to the presence or absence of periods of homelessness. The results throw light on the factors underlying the shift from "at risk" to "homeless," showing that youths with experience of homelessness are more likely to have been placed in substitute home environments, have experienced significant relationship difficulties with one of their parents (deterioration of the parent/youth relationship & parental abuse) & to have been diagnosed with behavioural disorders. The findings suggest that the decision to place young people under supervision is based more on the dynamic between risk factors rather than on the existence of behavioural problems. 4 Tables, 56 References.

AB  - Family socioeconomic status (SES) is closely associated with cognitive ability in children and adolescents. However, most of the research has come from high-income countries. There is only limited research on ‘street children’, who represent an aspect of low-SES particularly associated with low- and middle-income counties. The current research in Quito, Ecuador, compared a group of street-connected youth with a not street-connected control group on two different measures of theory of mind ability and verbal comprehension. Initial analysis revealed that the street-connected sample scored significantly below the level of the control sample for verbal comprehension. For the main analysis, street-connected youth were matched to control participants for age, sex, and verbal comprehension scores. The street-connected sample was found to perform significantly below the control sample on both measures of theory of mind. Furthermore, worse performance appeared to be linked to severity of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) within the street-connected sample. In conclusion, the association of relatively poor verbal comprehension with street-connectedness is consistent with existing research from high-income countries on SES gradients and cognitive development. In contrast, theory of mind ability, a core aspect of social cognition, may be particularly linked to the street-connectedness form of low SES that exists in many low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - Criminological research on homeless young adults has shown that males are more often arrested for violent offenses, while females engage more frequently in self-destructive behaviors. General strain theory (GST) provides a useful theoretical framework for understanding criminal behaviors and arrest history among homeless young adults. This study examined strains and responses to strains that significantly predict the likelihood of multiple arrests and investigated how predictors of multiple arrests vary by gender. Findings indicate that predictors for multiple arrests do indeed vary by gender, with exposure to the drug culture of the streets being an important variable for males, while being robbed with a weapon and drug distribution are significant predictors for females. Resilience showed an inverse relationship with multiple arrests, as did sexual assault for females. Study findings and implications for service provision are discussed. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

AB  - Purpose: Homeless youth are at an increased risk of HIV infection because of negative social determinants of health (e.g., poverty and unstable housing). As a result of being at a higher risk, homeless youth should be tested for HIV so they are aware of their status, and if infected, can quickly be linked to care. During a typical summer month in the metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia area, approximately 3,374 homeless and runaway youth live on the streets, in shelters, or in other unstable housing situations. Homeless youth have substantial unmet health needs and often engage in mutually reinforcing health risk behaviors. Our aim was to better understand the prevalence of having ever been tested for HIV among homeless youth in metropolitan Atlanta. Methods: Our analysis examined data regarding HIV testing behaviors among homeless youth aged 14-25 years in the 2015 Atlanta Youth Count and Needs Assessment (AYCNA). The AYCNA quantifies the number, and assesses the state of homeless, precariously housed, and runaway youth residing in Atlanta, Georgia. The study was designed using capture-recapture field-sampling methods. Participants were recruited by outreach and service workers that conducted observations of shelters and community locations where homeless youth spend time and reside. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Georgia State University. Chi-square analyses were conducted to determine statistically significant differences in "having ever been tested for HIV" (at p<.05 level) by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and six sexual risk behaviors. Sexual risk behaviors included: having ever experienced sexual assault or rape, having had sex in the previous year, physical abuse in a sexual relationship, sexual abuse in a sexual relationship, condom usage in the previous year, and having four or more sexual partners in the previous year. Results: There were 693 participants in the 2015 AYCNA sample, of which the majority were male (66.5%), aged 20-25 (70.9%), Black (70.0%), and heterosexual (73.1%). The prevalence of HIV testing was 88.4%. Prevalence of HIV testing was significantly higher among individuals who (a) were aged 20e25 years (91.6%) compared to those aged 14e19 years (80.9%), p<0.001; (b) had experienced sexual assault or rape (94.1%) compared to youth who had not (86.7%), p<0.01; (c), had not had sex in the previous year (89.5%) compared to those who did (80.2%), p<0.05; (d) had experienced physical abuse in a sexual relationship (94.2%) compared to youth who had not (87.1%), p<0.05; and (e) had experienced sexual abuse in a sexual relationship (97.6%) compared to youth who had not (87.3%), p<0.01. HIV testing did not differ significantly by race/ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, condom usage, or number of sexual partners. Conclusions: High prevalence of testing among homeless youth in Atlanta indicates public health success in targeting youth at risk. Nevertheless, significant differences in HIV testing prevalence suggest opportunities to improve uptake of HIV testing in younger homeless youth and those who have had sex in the previous year. Future studies should examine the linkages to care for homeless youth in Atlanta who test positive for HIV.

AB  - This paper presents findings from a study of how care leavers access and use housing services, and what they said had helped them to do so. The sample comprised 80 care leavers, and, for comparison, a group of 59 young people (termed 'in difficulty') who met certain criteria of disadvantage. Care leavers were found to have fewer crisis transitions and less experience of homelessness, together with a much higher level of autonomy and support in their first accommodation, relative to other young people in difficulty. Several factors are identified that, from the care leavers' point of view, contributed to their better access and use of housing services, including having family and friends to turn to, and leaving care teams that negotiated on their behalf with housing services. The paper concludes that care leavers had more positive housing experiences than other young people in difficulty, helped by the improved preparation for independence and ongoing support available to them from leaving care teams.

AB  - Child welfare-involved homeless families are at greater risk of poor social and economic outcomes compared with homeless families not involved with child welfare, and these negative outcomes reverberate in terms of economic and social costs to society. This study employed a mixed-methods approach to examine process findings from a randomized control trial from the first county-level Pay for Success initiative, Partnering for Family Success. The research compared housing, child welfare and public assistance outcomes for the treatment (N = 90) and control (N = 73) groups, explored how the program delivered its services, the service pattern over time, and perspectives of child welfare and program staff. We found that during and in the year after exiting the program, treatment group clients were less likely to use homeless services and were more likely to access public assistance benefits as compared with the control group clients, and during and after the program, the treatment and control group clients' child maltreatment reports were not statistically significantly different. There were positive indications from quantitative data showing that the intervention patterns align with those of Critical Time Intervention (CTI), with qualitative interview data indicating shifts over time in case management focus from short-term crisis management and housing stability toward working on longer-term independent living skills. The findings contribute to the literature regarding how best to serve homeless, child welfare-involved families, and suggest the necessity for longer-term interventions and greater attention to non-housing-related needs.

AB  - Traumatized adolescents in foster care manifest psychopathology at a higher incidence than those reared in conventional nuclear families. The consequence of antecedent maltreatment is felt by some observers to have ramifications in adulthood, such as delinquency and homelessness. There is a paucity of empirically sound research examining therapeutic initiatives that may enhance autonomy and utilize self-empowerment as a treatment model. Typically this population of adolescents suffer in all three domains; cognitive, behavioral and affective. This includes poor self-regulation capabilities, lack of coping skills, self-esteem, and anxiety and depressive related dysfunction. Guided imagery has shown promise in other populations while enabling individuals to manage life challenges, reduce anxiety/stress, regulate ones emotional reactions, and achieve goals. This study examined the effects of a 4-week guided imagery intervention on the cognitive, behavioral and affective domains of 16 adolescent boys living in residential foster care, as compared to a matched control group. Measures included the Beck Depression Inventory, Youth Self-Report of the Child Behavior Checklist, Adolescent Coping Orientation for Problem Experiences, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Findings were significant in all three domains.

AB  - Homelessness is associated with various co-occurring health and social problems yet; few contemporary international studies have examined these problems in young adulthood. This descriptive study presents cross-state comparison of the prevalence of young adult homelessness in Washington State, USA and Victoria, Australia using state representative samples from the International Youth Development Study (IYDS; n = 1945, 53% female). Associations between young adult homelessness and a range of co-occurring problems were examined using a modified version of the Communities That Care youth survey. Results showed significantly higher rates of past year homelessness were reported by young adults in Washington State (5.24% vs. 3.25% in Victoria). Cross-state differences were evident in levels of friends' drug use, antisocial behavior, weekly income and support from peers. Unemployment (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 2.67), antisocial behavior (AOR = 3.54) and victimization (AOR = 3.37) were more likely among young adults reporting homelessness in both states. Young adults with higher weekly income were less likely to report homelessness (AOR = 0.69) in both states. No significant association between mental health problem symptoms, substance use, family conflict or interaction with antisocial peers and homelessness were found in either state. Rates of violent behavior were more strongly related to young adult homelessness in Washington State than Victoria. The current findings suggest that programs that enable young adults to pursue income and employment, reduce antisocial behavior and include services for those who have been victimized, may help to mitigate harm among young adults experiencing homelessness.

AB  - Homeless infants are known to have poor birth outcomes, but the longitudinal impact of homelessness on health, health care use, and health spending during the early years of life has received little attention. Linking Massachusetts emergency shelter enrollment records for the period 2008-15 with Medicaid claims, we compared 5,762 infants who experienced a homeless episode with a group of 5,553 infants matched on sex, race/ethnicity, location, and birth month. Infants born during a period of unstable housing resulting in homelessness had higher rates of low birthweight, respiratory problems, fever, and other common conditions; longer neonatal intensive care unit stays; more emergency department visits; and higher annual spending. Differences in most health conditions persisted for two to three years. Asthma diagnoses, emergency department visits, and spending were significantly higher through age six. While screening and access to health care can be improved for homeless infants, long-term solutions require a broader focus on housing and income.

AB  - Background Social networks may play positive and negative roles in the lives of young adults experiencing homelessness (YEH) who are transitioning into housing. Social networks can influence their alcohol and/or other drug (AOD) use, as well as provide immediate and long-term support necessary for a successful transition.Methods We adapted a four-session computer-assisted motivational interviewing social network intervention (MI-SNI) for YEH transitioning into housing. We iteratively adapted and beta tested the intervention for delivery by case managers at an organization that provides supportive housing to YEH. We conducted a focus group with agency staff (n = 6), role-play exercises with case managers (n = 3), and semi-structured interviews with residents (n = 6). Interview data were thematically analyzed with open coding. This study presents the first adaptation of an innovative social network-based motivational intervention to reduce AOD use and increase stable, prosocial supportive connections via visualizations of the structure and composition of the individual’s social network.Results Participants rated sessions as “moderately” to “very” helpful and “good” quality on average. Participants agreed that the sessions were helpful, understandable, and satisfying and would work for new residents. Themes emerged in four broad categories: (1) Acceptability, (2) Positive benefits, (3) Visualization reactions, and (4) MI-SNI interface reactions. For the acceptability category, three sub-themes emerged: (1) understandability, (2) enjoyability and ease of use, (3) and barriers to acceptability. Five sub-themes emerged about the intervention’s likelihood to trigger positive benefits: (1) learning/new insights, (2) enhancement to motivation to change, (3) making AOD changes, (4) building social support, and (5) the intervention’s usefulness to some but not others. Five sub-themes also emerged from comments about the social network visualizations: (1) general positive comments, (2) understandability, (3) new insights, (4) triggering changes in social support, and (5) triggering changes in AOD use. When discussing the MI-SNI intervention interface beyond the visualizations, discussions emerged in three thematic categories: (1) discussion of name listing, (2) discussion of screen wording, and (3) the use of a computer interface to deliver the intervention.Conclusions Results suggest that the MI-SNI is acceptable to YEH and can be feasibly delivered by case managers during case management sessions.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04637815.

AB  -  Research to date has given little attention to differences in the experience of youth homelessness by ethnicity. This article provides a comparative descriptive analysis of the effect of differences and similarities in paths to homelessness, self-perception, and survival strategies on health behaviors and consequent health outcomes of African American and white homeless youth in San Francisco, USA. We conducted participant observation and ethnographic interviews with 54 youth primarily recruited from street venues. Hypotheses generated from the ethnographic data were validated in between-group analyses using concurrent epidemiological data collected from a sample of 205 youth. Our samples of unstably housed African American and white youth, though sharing common histories of family dysfunction, differed in both the ethnographic accounts and epidemiological analyses in their experiences of family, access to housing, street survival strategies, self-presentation, health behaviors and service utilization. Our sample of white youth generally identified with the term "homeless," engaged in survival activities associated with such a label, and accessed the services intended to address the needs of homeless youth. In contrast, our sample of African American youth generally did not perceive themselves as "homeless," a stigmatized term, and were thus less likely to utilize, or be accessed by, relevant services.

AB  - Objective:To test the effectiveness of Houvast: a strengths-based intervention for homeless young adults.Method:A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted with 10 Dutch shelter facilities randomly allocated to an intervention and a control group. Homeless young adults were interviewed when entering the facility and when care ended. Repeated-measures analyses and logistic regression analyses were conducted by the principle of intention-to-treat framework (N = 251).Results:Improvements were demonstrated on quality of life; satisfaction with family relations, finances, and health; employed or in school; depression; care needs; autonomy; competence, and resilience in both conditions. A higher proportion of homeless young adults who received care according to Houvast were still receiving care at follow-up and successfully completed the trajectory compared to those who received care as usual.Conclusion:Homeless young adults seem to benefit from service provision in general. Further research on the effectiveness of Houvast is needed after sufficient model fidelity has been achieved.

AB  - A multicausal model of adolescent homelessness is proposed, based upon the notion that homeless youth suffer from emotional, social, and cultural deprivation. The model was tested in a sample of homeless adolescents (n = 54) and a similar, but not homeless, control group (n = 58). Emotional deprivation was assessed on the Parental Bonding Inventory (Parker, Tupling,&Brown, 1979), whereas social and cultural deprivation were assessed on the Family Environment Scale (Moos&Moos, 1981). The homeless adolescents were found to be significantly more deprived emotionally, socially, and culturally than the controls. The results indicate support for a deprivation model of adolescent homelessness with implications for public policy and intervention planning.

AB  - Objective: Street children are vulnerable against HIV because of poverty, lack of family support, adult supervision, social exclusion, lack of access to health services and their special living environment. Required educational program could decrease the danger of transmission of HIV in this group. This study would investigate the effects of HIV prevention educational on street children's attitude and knowledge in the southeast of Iran. Methods: Totally, 60 street children were randomized into the intervention and control groups. Knowledge and attitude of the participants about HIV/AIDS were evaluated. Using two-day meeting, the intervention group received some information on the prevention, diagnosis, care and treatment and wrong and right believes of HIV/AIDS. The control group received nothing about the topic. Children settled in a childcare center by the end of the survey and after 30 days the knowledge and attitude of both groups were evaluated again. Results: The result of the study presented significant increase in street children's attitude and knowledge of intervention group compared to control group and before intervention. Follow-up data collected 1 month later revealed that the children who received the HIV/AIDS intervention subsequently had greater HIV/AIDS knowledge and favorable attitude toward HIV/AIDS. Conclusion: We showed by a two-day educational meeting, the knowledge and attitude of the street children could be improved. This improved knowledge and attitude could protect them against high-risk behaviors.

AB  - Adolescent and young adult health, development, and behavior lay a foundation for future population health. Increasing rates of young adult homelessness mean there is a need for research which generates evidence to support a stronger focus on population-level prevention. Using longitudinal data from a population-based sample of young adults participating in the cross-nationally matched International Youth Development Study, we examined adolescent antecedents of young adult homelessness in Washington State in the USA and in Victoria, Australia. Participants were surveyed using a modified version of the Communities That Care youth survey. Analyses of prospective, longitudinal data from 1945 participants, recruited as state-representative secondary school samples at grade 7 (average age 13, 2002) and longitudinally compared at young adulthood (average age 25, 2014), showed that young adults in Washington State reported higher rates of past year homelessness (5.24%) compared to those in Victoria (3.25%). Path modeling showed less positive family management strategies at age 13 uniquely increased risk for age 25 homelessness. This effect remained after accounting for age 15 antecedents in peer-group, school, and community environments. Friends’ drug use, school suspension, academic failure, and low neighborhood attachment at age 15 mediated the association between less positive family management strategies at age 13 and age 25 homelessness. Despite observing some cross-national differences in levels of family, peer-group, school, and community antecedents, we found that these factors equally increased risk for age 25 homelessness in both states, suggesting similar cross-national influences for young adult homelessness. The findings indicate cross-nationally common adolescent antecedents for young adult homelessness that could be targeted by prevention strategies across international settings.

AB  - Housing stability is a key component of rehabilitation for individuals with severe mental illnesses but remains a challenge for mental health service providers, particularly with young adults experiencing early mental health difficulties. The aim of this study is to explore perceptions of housing and home-leaving processes among young adults with emerging psychotic disorders and to compare it to the perceptions of young adults without psychotic disorders. A qualitative, grounded theory based, multiple case study was conducted among 52 adults aged 18-30 years old. Two core categories emerged in relation with perception of housing: choice/control over the residential environment, and housing opportunities over time. Difference between the groups include more coerced home-leaving for young adults with first-episode psychosis and low levels of choice, control and opportunities for a sub-group of participants living in group homes. The housing situation of young adults is analyzed and discussed from a systemic perspective.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  -  Issue Title: Housing and HIV/AIDSThis paper presents results of an evaluation of Project Independence (PI), a shallow rent subsidy program with services coordination support for very low income people with HIV or AIDS who live in Alameda County in the San Francisco Bay Area. By providing a small rental subsidy to eligible individuals and their families who are already stably housed, the philosophy of the program is to prevent homelessness before it starts. The housing outcomes of 185 PI clients were compared to those of 218 people who were not enrolled in the program but were presumed eligible for it, controlling for sociodemographic, HIV disease, and behavioral health characteristics. Using survival analysis techniques, non-program participants were found to be more likely to leave their rental housing at any given point in time compared to PI program participants. After one year of follow-up, while 99% of PI clients remained stably housed in their program-subsidized rental unit, only 32% of comparison group clients were still in rental housing. At two years, 96% of PI participants remained independently housed, compared to only 10% of non-participants. The success of the program suggests that Project Independence should be replicated and evaluated in other jurisdictions where a relatively high incidence and prevalence of HIV/AIDS is combined with a lack of affordable housing for low income households.

AB  - Background Young people experiencing homelessness have alarmingly high rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use, which is associated with sexual risk behaviors such as unprotected sex, trading sex, and sex with multiple casual partners. Few risk reduction programs for this population have been developed and rigorously evaluated, particularly those that address both of these interrelated behaviors, use a collaborative and non-judgmental approach, and are feasible to deliver in settings where homeless young people seek services. This paper describes the protocol of a study evaluating a four-session Motivational Interviewing (MI)-based group risk reduction intervention for this population. The protocol has been shown to be efficacious in pilot work over 3 months with 200 homeless young adults [1]. The current study seeks to refine the intervention protocol and evaluate the program on a larger scale.Methods/design In a cluster-cross-over randomized controlled trial, 18–25 year olds will receive the AWARE risk reduction program (n = 200) or standard care (n = 200) at one of three drop-in centers serving homeless youth in the Los Angeles area. We will evaluate intervention effects on primary outcomes of AOD use and sexual risk behavior, as well as secondary outcomes of health-related quality of life and social stability, over a 12-month period.Discussion This project has the potential to fill a significant gap in prevention services by demonstrating that a brief intervention, feasible to deliver within settings where young people experiencing homelessness typically seeks services, can significantly reduce the interrelated problems of AOD use and sexual risk behavior.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03735784.

AB  - PurposeUkraine has one of the fastest growing HIV epidemics globally. Due to their engagement in high-risk behaviors, adolescents and emerging adults involved with the penitentiary system are at a particularly high risk of HIV-acquisition. To address the epidemic, young males (aged 14 to 20 years) in penitentiary institutions across Ukraine participated in a ten-week, group-based HIV-prevention intervention (STEPS). The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approachThe authors analyzed clinical and programmatic services data collected as part of an evaluation of the STEPS intervention. Paired t-tests and χ2 were used to examine pre- and post-intervention differences in HV knowledge, attitudes, and risk behaviors and alcohol and other drug use knowledge.FindingsIn total, 105 male youths participated in the ten-session STEPS intervention. At baseline, males reported high frequencies of risk behaviors (e.g. unprotected sexual activity, injection drug use), moderate levels of HIV-related knowledge, and negative attitudes toward HIV and people living with HIV. At follow-up (immediately following the last STEPS session), participants’ HIV-related knowledge substantially improved and participants tended to have more favorable attitudes toward HIV.Research limitations/implicationsOutcomes suggest that knowledge and attitudes about HIV among Ukrainian incarcerated youth can improve as a result of group-based HIV-prevention intervention.Originality/valueIn Ukraine, individuals involved with the criminal justice system are one of the populations most-at-risk for HIV; criminal justice-involved adolescents and young adults are disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. Research among this sub-population is limited. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating an on-going group-based HIV-prevention program designed to reduce adolescent risk of HIV.

AB  - Despite the enormous cost of the foster care system, high rates of psychopathology and homelessness among young-adult foster care alumni provide a stark reminder of the challenges faced by this vulnerable population. This study characterizes the effect of a history of foster care on psychopathology in a group of 39 adolescents that had exited foster care and were reunified with their biological mothers. A history of foster care was defined as out-of-home placement by child welfare for at least one month; median foster stay was 1.5 years and median age at placement was 8.5 years. A control group of 78 adolescents was matched with the foster group using exact and logistic-regression nearest-neighbor methods. Matched variables included well-established, major childhood risk factors for the development of psychopathology: maternal substance abuse, maternal psychopathology, and childhood maltreatment (i.e. physical and sexual abuse, neglect and domestic violence). With the two groups matched in this way, recent research suggests that the two groups had comparable histories of adverse childhood events, and thus the major inter-group difference is a temporary separation from the biological mother, enforced by child welfare services (i.e foster care). Participants, and their mothers as second reporters, completed self-report, parent-report and structured interview assessments, providing data on major psychiatric diagnoses and symptom scales. The prevalence of externalizing diagnoses in the foster group was 41.0% (24.9% -- 57.2%) compared with 19.2% (10.3% -- 28.2%) in the control group (r = .25). Substance dependence prevalence was 25.6% (11.3% -- 40.0%) compared with 5.1% (0.1% -- 10.1%) in the control group (r = .30). The foster group also had more depression symptoms as measured by three assessments ( p < .05, r = .21 to .25); the foster group also had more overall externalizing symptoms (p = .015, r = .22), including conduct problems (p = .007, r = .25) and hyperactivity (p = .023, r = .21). For every comparison made, the foster group demonstrated more psychopathology than controls. Thus despite the protective goal of foster care, it may have detrimental effects on the child's subsequent development. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings that have the potential to substantially alter child welfare policy by reducing the number of foster care placements in favor of other child and family support services.

AB  - Homeless girls are one of the world's most vulnerable sociocultural groups. Homeless girls experience forced labor victimization, sexual exploitation, abuse, discrimination and marginalization at higher rates than the general population. As a result, they often present internalized and externalized psychological disorders and lack functional problem solving, coping and emotion regulation skills, which can negatively affect mental health and well-being. Despite these serious disparities, few research studies have addressed homeless girls' mental health and well-being. Virtually no known research addressing the psychosocial differences between sub-groups of Mexican homeless girls, including girls that are at risk of homelessness and unhoused girls or girls housed in emergency shelters, exists to date. The aim of this study was to examine differences of psychosocial characteristics in homeless girls by subgroup. Working with nongovernmental organizations that serve homeless youth, a convenience sample of 90 Mexican girls between the ages of 11 and 18, including 45 emergency sheltered or unsheltered girls and a comparison group of 45 girls at risk of homelessness, were individually interviewed using psychometric instruments developed by the authors. Findings revealed that emergency sheltered or unsheltered homeless girls experience higher levels of depression, higher levels of dysfunctional emotional regulation strategies, lower indexes of subjective well-being, and experience negative emotions more intensely and frequently than the comparison at risk for homelessness group. This study is limited in its generalizability due to its purposive sampling method. Study implications highlight the need for specific interventions by sub-group to promote the mental health and well-being of homeless girls and girls at risk for homelessness.

AB  -  Homelessness affects HIV risk and health, but little is known about the longitudinal effects of rental assistance on the housing status and health of homeless and unstably housed people living with HIV/AIDS. Homeless/unstably housed people living with HIV/AIDS (N = 630) were randomly assigned to immediate Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS (HOPWA) rental assistance or customary care. Self-reported data, CD4, and HIV viral load were collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Results showed that housing status improved in both groups, with greater improvement occurring in the treatment group. At 18 months, 51% of the comparison group had their own housing, limiting statistical power. Intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated significant reductions in medical care utilization and improvements in self-reported physical and mental health; significant differential change benefiting the treatment group was observed for depression and perceived stress. Significant differences between homeless and stably housed participants were found in as-treated analyses for health care utilization, mental health, and physical health. HOPWA rental assistance improves housing status and, in some cases, health outcomes of homeless and unstably housed people living with HIV/AIDS.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - There are two factors that limit our knowledge of the risk factors associated with homelessness among runaway adolescents, namely (1) the samples used are often composed of youth homeless service users and/or youths living on the streets (visible homelessness), whereas most adolescents in fact use private resources (hidden homelessness), and (2) failure to use an adequate control group to identify risk factors associated specifically with homelessness. Our study compares the characteristics of two groups of youths under the supervision of the youth protection system, according to the presence or absence of periods of homelessness. The results throw light on the factors underlying the shift from at risk to homeless, showing that youths with experience of homelessness are more likely to have been placed in substitute home environments, have experienced significant relationship difficulties with one of their parents (deterioration of the parent/youth relationship and parental abuse) and to have been diagnosed with behavioural disorders. The findings suggest that the decision to place young people under supervision is based more on the dynamic between risk factors rather than on the existence of behavioural problems.

AB  - The present study represents the first large-scale, prospective comparison to test whether aging out of foster care contributes to homelessness risk in emerging adulthood. A nationally representative sample of adolescents investigated by the child welfare system in 2008 to 2009 from the second cohort of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being Study (NSCAW II) reported experiences of housing problems at 18- and 36-month follow-ups. Latent class analyses identified subtypes of housing problems, including literal homelessness, housing instability, and stable housing. Regressions predicted subgroup membership based on aging out experiences, receipt of foster care services, and youth and county characteristics. Youth who reunified after out-of-home placement in adolescence exhibited the lowest probability of literal homelessness, while youth who aged out experienced similar rates of literal homelessness as youth investigated by child welfare but never placed out of home. No differences existed between groups on prevalence of unstable housing. Exposure to independent living services and extended foster care did not relate with homelessness prevention. Findings emphasize the developmental importance of families in promoting housing stability in the transition to adulthood, while questioning child welfare current focus on preparing foster youth to live.

AB  - Background: Poly-victimization is common among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) and youth in substance use treatment. To date, studies have not examined poly-victimization among these two intersecting populations. Objective: To examine heterogeneity in lifetime victimization experiences among youth reporting homelessness at substance use treatment entry; identify demographic predictors of victimization class membership; and associations between victimization and clinical characteristics at treatment intake. Participants and setting: 1270 adolescents and young adults reporting past 90-day homelessness in a nationwide substance use treatment data set. Methods: Latent Class Analysis (LCA) and logistic regression were used to examine heterogeneity in poly-victimization experiences, and associations with demographics and clinical characteristics for males and females. Results: Four victimization classes emerged for males, and five victimization classes emerged for females. The prevalence of victimization and trauma characteristics were higher for females, except physical victimization, which was higher for males. Age, race/ethnicity, and sexual minority status were related to poly-victimization class membership, but not consistently across classes. Compared to low or single victimization classes, youth in the poly-victimization class had higher odds of post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, and exchange sex (among females); Poly-victimization class membership was not associated with duration of recent homelessness or substance use disorder diagnoses, when compared to low/less complex victimization. Conclusion: High rates of lifetime victimization were found for YEH in substance use treatment, with rates generally higher among females. Trauma-informed interventions are needed to address complex victimization experiences and poor mental health among unstably housed youth in treatment.

AB  - This study compared the costs and outcomes associated with three treatment programs that served 149 individuals with dual disorders (i.e., individuals with co-occurring severe mental illness and substance use disorders) who were homeless at baseline. The three treatment programs were: Integrated Assertive Community Treatment (IACT), Assertive Community Treatment only (ACTO), and standard care (Control). Participants were randomly assigned to treatment and followed for a period of 24 months. Clients in the IACT and ACTO programs were more satisfied with their treatment program and reported more days in stable housing than clients in the Control condition. There were no significant differences between treatment groups on psychiatric symptoms and substance use. The average total costs associated with the IACT and Control conditions were significantly less than the average total costs for the ACTO condition. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of quality of life therapy in a group manner on the coping styles of Homeless or abused girls in Isfahan boarding schools this research is semi-experimental and was followed up and implemented with pre-test-post-test design. The statistical population of this study was 200 inactive and poorly cared for girls aged 12-18 living in Isfahan boarding schools. Coincidentally, 30 people were divided into two groups of 15 people tested and controlled. Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics of repeated measurement analysis of variance were used to evaluate the research hypotheses. The results showed that the difference between the meanings of the two experimental and control groups in the post-test stage and the follow-up with the control of the pre-test stage scores in the coping styles was significant. And the quality of life training course has increased the use of problem-oriented style and reduced the style of emotion-oriented among orphaned and homeless girls (p <0.01). Also, the effect of this intervention has not changed or decreased over time (p <0.05) and the effect of the training course in the follow-up phase has remained relatively constant. Based on the results obtained, it is stated that quality of life training courses can increase problem-oriented styles and the solution will be to focus and improve decisions and ultimately the quality of life of individuals.

AB  - This paper analyses the relationship between inadequate housing and the school performance of children from poor Czech households. It shows that children (ages 7-12) from low-income households (defined as those with up to 2.4 times the minimum living income) have higher chances of serious problems in school performance if they live in unstable or nonresidential housing. The effects of housing instability and non-residential housing among children from low-income households are significant and substantial even when controlling for parents' educational attainment and labour activity, family structure (e.g. single parent etc.), household size, and the child's age. The effects of other housing problems are significant only in their extreme forms (overcrowdedness) or when combined with other housing problems (the housing cost burden). These findings are used to examine whether the Czech Social Housing Act currently under discussion is needed to help poor families with children and whether it has adequately defined its target group if it is to protect Czech children from the negative effects of inadequate housing.

AB  - Foster youth and youth who grow up in poverty are at risk for experiencing difficulties in adulthood. However, youth in foster care may be at a greater disadvantage due to additional stressors associated with being removed from home and placed into care. Much of the research assessing outcomes associated with foster care compare foster youth to other youth in care or to youth in the general population. In the current study, we used propensity scores and careful sampling to closely match a sample of 17-year-old foster youth (N = 332) with a group of 17-year-old high-risk youth (N = 83) who had not experienced foster care to evaluate them on risk and protective factors associated with various outcomes in adulthood. A well-fitting structural equation model (SEM) indicated that compared to high risk youth who have never been in foster care, youth in foster care experience higher rates of incarceration, homelessness, early parenthood, and referral to drug and/or alcohol treatment as well as lower levels of education attainment. An interaction between foster care status and gender significantly predicted incarceration. Males in foster care were more likely to experience incarceration compared to other youth. These experiences predict further difficulties in adulthood. Implications for youth currently in care are discussed.

AB  - Foster youth in the U.S. often face a multitude of adverse outcomes, including low educational attainment, elevated rates of adult poverty, and disproportionately high levels of adult homelessness. One newer area of social policy research and advocacy, asset building, may help explain some of these disparities. Foster youth face several barriers to asset building. For example, many youth have several placements during their stay in care, resulting in youth receiving inconsistent schooling, mentoring, and support, and facing limited opportunities to work, save money, or build academic and professional networks. This paper examines the frequency with which transition-age foster youth receive asset building services and whether the youth who receive services experience improved outcomes compared to those who do not. Analyzing data from the National Youth in Transition Database and using a Propensity Score Matching methodology, this study finds that youth receiving Budgeting and Financial Education Services and Post-Secondary Education Services experience significantly improved outcomes, including reduced likelihood of homelessness and increased likelihood of employment and educational enrollment. However, only 29% of youth receive Budgeting and Financial Education Services, and only 19% of youth receive Post-Secondary Education Services. Service receipt also covaries with demographics, including race/ethnicity and education level. These findings have noteworthy implications for both policy and practice as asset building for foster youth is a potentially promising realm for public service expansion.

AB  - Objective: To identify evaluations of interventions that target multiple risk factors in high‐risk young people, describe their characteristics, critique their methodological quality and summarise their effectiveness.Methods: A search of the literature published between 2009 and 2014 identified 13 evaluations of interventions that targeted multiple risk factors, compared to 95 evaluations that targeted single risk factors. The methodological adequacy of the 13 evaluation studies was analysed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies and information regarding characteristics and intervention effectiveness was extracted and summarised.Results: There were very few outcome evaluation studies of interventions that targeted multiple risk factors, relative to single risk factors, among high‐risk young people. Of the identified studies, half were methodologically weak. Interventions delivered in community settings targeted a greater number of risk factors, while those delivered in a school or health setting reported a higher proportion of statistically significant outcomes. No economic analyses were conducted.Conclusions and Implications for Public Health: More methodologically rigorous evaluations of interventions targeting multiple risk factors among high‐risk young people are required, especially for those delivered in community settings. Four key areas for improvement are: i) more precisely defining the risk factors experienced by high‐risk young people; ii) achieving greater consistency across interventions; iii) standardising outcome measures; and iv) conducting economic analyses.

AB  - Young adults (ages 18-24) are especially vulnerable to homelessness in the United States, and those experiencing homelessness exhibit high prevalence for many kinds of abuse and negative health outcomes. This article reviews common behavioral health issues facing homeless youth and assesses collective wisdom on effective treatments and services for this vulnerable population. On the whole, the research remains focused on individual-level risk and protective factors and service use patterns and preferences, which detracts from the structural issues that have shaped these individuals' experiences in the first place and are key to resolving them.

AB  - The current study examined attitudes about the homeless among a range of social service and healthcare employees using both self-report and an experimental approach. Ninety-six respondents were recruited from drop-in shelters, medical facilities and social service agencies. After completing an initial measure of homelessness stigmatization, participants were randomly assigned into one of two experimental conditions in which they were given a description of a fictional 20-year-old client described as either homeless or domiciled. It was hypothesized that prior to the manipulation there will be no differences between the two groups and that the manipulation would induce those who read about the homeless client to subsequently endorse more stereotyped beliefs than those who read about a domiciled counterpart. The results revealed no pre-manipulation differences between the groups, while the manipulation invoked beliefs that the homeless client was dangerous, needed help with reading and financial literacy, and needed advice on personal hygiene, compared to the control group. These results highlight the work that still needs to be done in training service providers in terms of providing a bias-free environment for potential clients. Future studies should investigate whether proper training and education reduce preexisting assumptions about homeless clients.

AB  - In October 2006, a survey was undertaken of youth "on the streets" in the Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions of Tanzania (n = 1,923). The question of interest was if street children who live on streets full-time differ concerning reports of abuse and support, compared to reports of children who are only part-time on the streets, and to children who don't self-identify as "street children" at all. Results show full-time street children reporting significantly more abuse than part-time counterparts, or children who were not street children (mean difference = -1.44, P < .001). Concerning support scores, non-street children and part-time street children reported significantly more support from their family than full-time street children (mean difference = 1.70, P < .001). This information identifies possible reasons why vulnerable children migrate to live on the streets in the urban areas, and contributes to the limited literature and data on this subject.

AB  - While research on homeless adolescents and young adults evidencing substance use disorder is increasing, there is a dearth of information regarding effective interventions, and more research is needed to guide those who serve this population. The current study builds upon prior research showing promising findings of the community reinforcement approach (CRA) (Slesnick, Prestopnik, Meyers, & Glassman, 2007). Homeless adolescents and young adults between the ages of 14 to 20 years were randomized to one of three theoretically distinct interventions: (1) CRA (n = 93), (2) motivational enhancement therapy (MET, n = 86), or (3) case management (CM, n = 91). The relative effectiveness of these interventions was evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months post-baseline. Findings indicated that substance use and associated problems were significantly reduced in all three interventions across time. Several moderating effects were found, especially for sex and history of childhood abuse. Findings show little evidence of superiority or inferiority of the three interventions and suggest that drop-in centers have choices for addressing the range of problems that these adolescents and young adults face.

AB  - To assess HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)-related drug & sex risk behaviors & evaluate factors associated with change in risk behaviors among runaway & homeless adolescents, 244 street youths were recruited from a community drop-in center serving high-risk youth in CO. Using a cross-sectional design, some 50% of subjects (Ss) received training in a peer-based intervention that included principles derived from the health belief model, while the remaining Ss received no intervention. Ss were interviewed at baseline, immediately following the intervention (for those receiving the training), & 3 months later. Logistic regression & analysis of covariance revealed that, compared to the control Ss, intervention Ss significantly increased their HIV knowledge. Multivariate analyses showed that knowledge & greater perceived chance for HIV were associated with high-risk behavior; however, lower concern about HIV infection was also associated with high-risk behavior, supporting the health belief model. Results underscore the challenge faced in developing effective interventions with this population. 2 Tables, 2 Figures, 53 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Parents and children experiencing an episode of homelessness face a variety of adverse factors that can increase their risk of difficult relationships and even child maltreatment. Parent support programs have been suggested as one way to strengthen parent-child relationships and decease risk of child maltreatment for this vulnerable population, but such programs have not been rigorously evaluated. This study was designed to investigate if Circle of Parents, a self-help support group developed to decrease child maltreatment, was a feasible, acceptable, and effective intervention for parents residing in shelters (N = 80). The investigation utilized a quasi-experimental design using propensity score analysis with a services-as-usual comparison group. The Protective Factors Survey (PFS) and a client satisfaction questionnaire served as the primary outcome measures and group facilitators provided information about feasibility of the intervention within shelters. Promising evidence was found for the acceptability and feasibility of Circle of Parents. However, analyses of PFS data showed little difference between the intervention and services-as-usual comparison groups. Overall, findings pointed to emerging positive findings but underscored the need for continued controlled examination of the effectiveness of Circle of Parents implemented in shelters and transitional housing.

AB  -  Issue Title: Housing and HIV/AIDSThe objectives of this article are to explore differences in HIV risk behaviors and subsequent risk reduction among female drug users based on their housing conditions. In addition, we investigate psychosocial characteristics as mediators. Data were collected from 336 adult women. Structured interviews were conducted at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. At baseline, women with unstable housing conditions reported higher levels of HIV drug and sex-related HIV risk behavior. In addition, their levels of behavioral change over time were lower. The findings also show the importance of expanding the stable housing condition into two categories thereby distinguishing between a woman's own and someone else's place. None of the mediating factors were statistically significant and there was no moderation by intervention condition. The findings suggest that unstable housing conditions form a structural barrier to HIV risk reduction irrespective of the message. Future interventions should consider such conditions and the larger social context of the women's lives. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The effects of housing instability and homelessness on child and adult health are well documented. However, few studies have explored health and housing interventions for families with children with the objective of health improvement. Housing Prescriptions as Health care is a randomized controlled trial that is investigating the impact on physical and mental health of integrating priority placement in affordable housing and the provision of services (case management, financial, and legal), compared to the standard of care (providing resource guides and hospital-based social work or care navigation services). In 2016-19 seventy-eight homeless or housing-unstable families defined as "medically complex"-with a child or adult member who used more health services than usual or had a chronic disease or disability- were enrolled in the trial, and sixty-seven completed a six-month followup. A difference-in-differences analysis at six months showed decreases in the share of children in fair or poor health and in average anxiety and depression scores among parents in the intervention group, relative to the control group. Findings suggest that a population-specific model that integrates health, housing, legal, and social services can improve healthrelated outcomes at the household level.

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-risk behaviors among street youth were assessed by gender & housing status based on 429 structured interviews conducted in northern CA in 1993. Results revealed that less than 50% of the sample used condoms regularly, & almost 33% had used injection drugs. Females were as likely as males to use injection drugs, more likely to engage in sexual activity & be diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease, & less likely to use condoms consistently. Youth currently without housing reported higher rates of injection & other drug use. The high level of HIV risk behaviors among this sample of street youth suggests an urgent need for gender-specific prevention efforts & an increased range of housing options. 6 Tables, 43 References.

AB  - This paper presents findings from a study of how care leavers access and use housing services, and what they said had helped them to do so. The sample comprised 80 care leavers, and, for comparison, a group of 59 young people (termed 'in difficulty') who met certain criteria of disadvantage. Care leavers were found to have fewer crisis transitions and less experience of homelessness, together with a much higher level of autonomy and support in their first accommodation, relative to other young people in difficulty. Several factors are identified that, from the care leavers' point of view, contributed to their better access and use of housing services, including having family and friends to turn to, and leaving care teams that negotiated on their behalf with housing services. The paper concludes that care leavers had more positive housing experiences than other young people in difficulty, helped by the improved preparation for independence and ongoing support available to them from leaving care teams.

AB  - For poor families, the possession of assets--savings accounts, homes, and the like--has the potential not only to relieve some of the stress of living in poverty but also to make a better future seem like a real possibility. If children in families that own certain assets fare better than children in families without them, then helping poor families build those assets would be an effective strategy for two-generation programs. Indeed, write Michal Grinstein-Weiss, Trina Williams Shanks, and Sondra Beverly, plenty of evidence shows that assets are connected to positive outcomes for poor children. For example, young people who have any college savings at all, even a very small amount, are more likely to go to college; children in households with assets score higher on standardized achievement tests; and children of homeowners experience fewer behavioral problems. But this evidence comes from longitudinal data sets and is therefore correlational. Looking for causal relationships, the authors examine the results of experimental programs that opened various types of savings accounts for poor people and matched their contributions. Several of these trials included a control group that did not receive a savings account, making it possible to attribute any positive outcomes directly to the savings accounts rather than to their owners' personal characteristics. These programs dispelled the myth that poor people can't save; participants were generally able to accumulate savings. It's too early to tell, however, whether assets and asset-building programs have long-term effects on children's wellbeing, though one experiment found positive impacts on disadvantaged children's social-emotional development at age four. The most promising programs share several features: they are opened early in life; they are opened automatically, with no action required from the recipients; and they come with an initial deposit.

AB  - Objective: Youth experiencing homelessness are at risk for HIV and need interventions to prevent risky sex behaviors. We tested the feasibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) to select peer change agents (PCAs) to deliver HIV prevention messages among youth experiencing homelessness. Method: We used a pretest–posttest quasi-experimental design. In the AI condition (n = 62), 11 PCAs were selected via AI algorithm; in the popularity comparison (n = 55), 11 PCAs were selected 6 months later based on maximum degree centrality (most ties to others in the network). All PCAs were trained to promote HIV testing and condom use among their peers. Participants were clients at a drop-in center in Los Angeles, CA. HIV testing and condom use were assessed via a self-administered, computer-based survey at baseline (n = 117), 1 month (n = 86, 74%), and 3 months (n = 70, 60%). Results: At 3 months, rates of HIV testing increased among participants in the AI condition relative to the comparison group (18.8% vs. 8.1%), as did condom use during anal sex (12.1% vs. 3.3%) and vaginal sex (29.2% vs. 23.7%). Conclusions: AI-enhanced PCA intervention is a feasible method for engaging youth experiencing homelessness in HIV prevention.

AB  - Objectives: The current study sought to test hard drug use outcomes for youth receiving a strengths-based outreach and advocacy intervention that linked youth to either a shelter or a drop-in center. Methods: Homeless youth (14-24 years old) were engaged by research assistants (RAs) at soup kitchens, parks, libraries, and other locations that homeless youth were known to frequent. Youth were randomly assigned to receive six months of advocacy that focused on linking youth to a drop-in center (n = 40) or to a crisis shelter (n = 39). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Hard drug use over time was the main outcome. Intervention condition and service connection were used as predictors for the baseline level and the slope of change in hard drug use over time. Data analysis was conducted with Bernoulli Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling in HLM7. Results: The current study found that those who were in the drop-in linkage condition exhibited a greater reduction in their odds of using hard drugs during the follow-up points than their counterparts in the shelter linkage condition. And finally, those who utilized services more often during the follow-ups were those who exhibited less hard drug use at baseline and less reduction in their odds of using hard drugs. Conclusions: This study suggests that drop-in centers, which are often characterized by low-demand programming and few behavioral restrictions, are effective for addressing hard drug use among homeless youth.

AB  - Sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth experience housing instability, including homelessness, at higher rates than heterosexuals. Few studies have examined differences within SGM populations and intersections of housing and health. Data were drawn from a study of SGM young adults who were assigned male at birth. Nearly one-quarter of the sample reported homelessness, unstable housing, or both in the six months prior to assessment. Housing instability was higher among those of lower income and educational attainment. Additionally, those who experienced any housing instability reported higher levels of depression, poorer self-rated health, and greater gay-related stigma; in multivariable models, only self-rated health was related to housing status. Stigma and discrimination may lead to poorer mental health; housing instability and homelessness may be a manifestation of stigma perpetuated by social conditions and mental health burdens directed by familial rejection. Findings indicate the importance of a biopsychosocial perspective in addressing housing instability in SGM youth.

Youths aged 13-23 were recruited from agency & street sites using a stratified probability sampling design. Interviewers administered a structured survey instrument lasting 20 minutes, which assessed youths' involvement in HIV risk-related sexual & drug-use behaviors, contact with outreach workers, & other variables. Significantly more Los Angeles youths (78%) reported testing than did San Diego youths (52%; p less than .001). Multivariable analyses controlling for risk behaviors, knowing someone with HIV, & contact with outreach workers indicated that the higher rates of these factors in Los Angeles did not account for the difference in testing rates between the cities. Youths in Los Angeles were still 1.85 times as likely to be tested as San Diego youths (p less than .001), possibly a result of differing normative behavior & accessibility of testing services. 3 Tables, 1 Figure, 22 References.

AB  - Background Little is known about the engagement of young people who use drugs (PWUD) in harm reduction programs (HRPs), and few studies have included non-opioid users and non-injectors. While HRPs have effectively engaged PWUD, young people are under-represented in their services. Methods The Injection Drug Users Health Alliance Citywide Study (IDUCS) is the largest community-based study of PWUD in HRPs in the US. From 2014-2015, 2421 HRP participants across New York City (NYC) completed a cross-sectional survey. We investigated differences in socio-demographics, service utilization, and risk behaviors between young (aged 18-30) and older participants and examined factors associated with overdose among young participants. Results The study included 257 young participants. They were significantly more likely than older participants to be white, educated, uninsured, unstably housed or homeless, and have a history of incarceration and residential drug treatment. They were more likely to report recent overdose but less likely to report knowledge of naloxone. Young participants also had higher rates of alcohol, marijuana, benzodiazepine, and injection drug use, and related risk behaviors such as public injection. Factors associated with past year overdose among young participants included experiencing symptoms of psychological distress (AOR = 9.71), being unstably housed or homeless (AOR = 4.39), and utilizing detox (AOR = 4.20). Conclusions Young PWUD who access services at HRPs in NYC differ significantly from their older counterparts. New York City and other urban centers that attract young PWUD should consider implementing harm reduction oriented services tailored to the unique needs of young people.

AB  - Households experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) and food insecurity are at high risk of lifelong physical and behavioral difficulties. Longitudinal data from a perinatal home-visiting cluster-randomized controlled intervention trial in South Africa townships were used to examine the relationships between household settings and mothers’ histories of risk and children’s behavior problems at 3 and 5 years of age. IPV, food insecurity, maternal depressed mood, and geriatric pregnancy (at age of 35 or older) were consistently associated with children’s internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Aggressive behavior was more prevalent among 3- and 5-year olds boys, and was associated with maternal alcohol use. The effects of these factors on child behavior were more prominent than maternal HIV status. There is a continuing need to reduce IPV and household food insecurity, as well as supporting older, depressed, alcohol using mothers in order to address children’s behavioral needs.

AB  - Objectives: To review empirical evaluations of individual-level interventions intended to improve mental health or well-being for vulnerable adolescents. Study design: This is a systematic mapping review. Methods: Thirteen databases covering academic and gray literature were searched for published reviews and randomised controlled trials, and gray literature (2005–2016) and the results quality-assessed to prioritise best available evidence. We aimed to identify well-conducted systematic reviews and trials that evaluated individual-level interventions, for mental health/well-being outcomes, where the population was adolescents aged 10–24 years in any of 12 vulnerable groups at high risk of poor health outcomes (e.g. homeless, offenders, ‘looked after’, carers). Results: Thirty systematic reviews and 16 additional trials were identified. There was insufficient evidence to identify promising individual-level interventions that improve the mental health/well-being of any of the vulnerable groups. Conclusions: Despite Western policy to promote health and well-being among vulnerable young people, the dearth of evidence suggests a lack of interest in evaluating interventions targeting these groups in respect of their mental health/well-being outcomes.

AB  - Substance use is highly prevalent among youth living with HIV (YLWH) and negatively impacts HIV care. This study sought to determine whether the CRAFFT (Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, and Trouble), designed to screen for problematic substance use, is reliably associated with substance use behaviors among YLWH. A cross-sectional sample of 2216 youth (ages 12-26) were recruited through the adolescent medicine trials network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. Participants completed a self-administered survey. Over half screened positive on the CRAFFT (i.e., [greater than or equal to]2). Among frequent substance users, those older in age, behaviorally infected, with history of incarceration or unstably housed were more likely to screen positive on the CRAFFT. Study findings suggest that the CRAFFT reliably identifies youth who use substances. Thus, screening measures such as the CRAFFT should be utilized routinely in HIV clinical settings for youth.

Participants from the three groups differed markedly in patterns of risk behavior, with delinquent & homeless youths consistently reporting higher levels of risky behavior than those in the comparison group. However, differences between the homeless & delinquent youth on risk behaviors, knowledge, & attitudes suggest that HIV prevention efforts are more likely to succeed if they address the specific needs of these populations.

AB  - Objectives: The experience of homelessness for young people can affect social, emotional, and physical development, resulting in poorer physical and mental health outcomes. To reduce rates of youth homelessness, a better understanding of both risk and resilience is needed to inform future intervention development. This article presents a systematic review of published research reporting risk or resilience factors related to homelessness among young people in Western countries. Methods: After thorough examination for inclusion criteria, 665 abstracts of peer-reviewed quantitative studies of risk or resilience factors for homelessness among young people (ages 0–25) that included an adequate comparison group (e.g., not homeless) were selected. After abstract and full-text screening, 16 articles were reviewed. A primary prevention framework was used to create an explanatory model for the onset of homelessness using risk and resilience factors. Results: Common risk factors for youth homelessness included difficulties with family, mental health or substance use problems, a history of problem behaviors, a history of foster care, homelessness as a child, and running away. Common protective factors included a supportive family, a college education, and high socioeconomic status. Findings were integrated into a provisional developmental model of youth homelessness risk. Clinical implications of the model for service development are discussed, and a model for monitoring homelessness risk and resilience factors is proposed. Conclusions: Factors affecting homelessness risk among youths and adults differ, with family, foster care, and schooling playing a much more important role among youths. Findings highlight opportunities for youth homelessness prevention strategies and monitoring.

AB  - Purpose – The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of introducing clinical case management into a youth alcohol and other drug treatment setting.Design/methodology/approach – Case management as usual (CMAU), the current brokerage model operating as a control group was compared to clinical case management (CCM). Individual client outcomes were compared with the site as the grouping variable.Findings – Although alcohol and drug outcomes were similar, arguably slightly favouring the intervention group, results suggest that young people receiving clinical case management showed potentially greater improvement across a range of other health outcomes including mental health, treatment utilisation and social outcomes than the CMAU brokerage model.Practical implications – The study examined the feasibility of training clinicians in a youth alcohol and drug treatment agency in a clinical case management model and examined whether this more intensive case management approach could improve substance use and mental health outcomes for young people.Originality/value – Although widely used, much less is known about the efficacy of case management within substance use treatment settings, where case management tends to be loosely defined and encompasses a broad range of activities. The originality of this study is that little is known about the effectiveness of case management in youth services, where it tends to be the primary service offered.

AB  - The Health Resources and Services Administration's Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) supports direct health care treatment and support services to more than 50% of all people living with diagnosed HIV in the United States. A critical goal of the RWHAP is to reduce HIVrelated health disparities to help end the HIV epidemic. From 2010 through 2016, the RWHAP made significant progress reducing viral suppression disparities among client populations, particularly among women, transgender persons, youths, Blacks or African Americans, and unstably housed clients. To assist with the reduction of the remaining disparities in HIV-related health outcomes among clients, the RWHAP continues to support planning and resource allocation for RWHAP Parts A through D and AIDS Drug Assistance Program, as well as through implementing policy and program initiatives, Special Projects of National Significance, evaluation studies, and collaborations to disseminate effective interventions.

AB  - Although abstinence from drug use is often a key goal of youth substance use treatment, transitioning to less harmful routes and types of drug use is desirable from both a clinical and public health perspective. Despite this, little is known about the trajectories of youth who inject drugs including changes in patterns of non-injection drug use. The At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS) is a longitudinal cohort of street-involved youth who use drugs in Vancouver, Canada. We used linear growth curve modeling to compare changes in non-injection drug use among participants who ceased injecting drugs for at least one 6-month period between September 2005 and May 2015 to matched controls who continued injecting over the same period. Of 387 eligible participants, 173 (44.7%) reported ceasing drug injection at least once. Non-injection drug use occurred during 160 (79.6%) periods of injection cessation. In adjusted linear growth curve analyses, the only non-injection drug use pattern observed to decrease significantly more than controls following injection cessation was daily crack/cocaine use (p = 0.024). With the exception of frequent crack/cocaine use, transitions out of injection drug use did not appear to coincide with increased reductions in patterns of non-injection drug use. Our findings indicate that most (80%) of the observed injection cessation events occurred in the context of ongoing substance use. Given that transitioning out of drug injection represents a significant reduction in risk and harm, efforts supporting vulnerable youth to move away from injecting may benefit from approaches that allow for ongoing non-injection drug use.

AB  - Ohio families (N not given) who had reported youths aged 10-18 as missing persons to the juvenile bureau from Sept 1975 to Feb 1976 were randomly assigned weekly to either an experimental (a one-shot, 3.5-4 hour group session) or control (no intervention) group to assess the effects of short-term intervention on families in crisis. A "negative-control" group was added to incorporate those assigned to the experimental group who did not follow through. Pre- & posttest measures (via juvenile records & information supplied by families at group treatment sessions, & telephone interviews of all families, respectively) were used to assess family functioning in six target areas: (1) youth's school attendance; (2) subsequent institutionalization of runaway; (3) parents' outlook toward youth's future; (4) change in parental self-estimation; (5) change in youth's relationship toward parents; & (6) use of new community services. Chi square analysis revealed that the one-shot intervention had a mild positive impact on these families, while those who did not follow through with treatment experienced high amounts of deterioration in family cohesion; the control group exhibited lesser gains & losses. Early crisis intervention thus appears to improve the chances of conflict resolution, while its absence increases the likelihood of family deterioration. 2 Tables, 12 References. Modified HA.

AB  - IntroductionPoverty has a detrimental influence on psychological well-being of children. Existing evidence shows that positive psychology interventions are possible to mitigate such impact. Despite criticisms that positive psychology resembles a scientific Pollyannaism that promotes overly positivity, positive psychology is not the scientific Pollyannaism that denies the difficulties and emotions that people may experience. Whereas, positive psychology acknowledges the difficulties and emotions, alongside with building up human resilience, strength and growth to face adversity. This study examined the feasibility of implementing a positive psychology intervention among Hong Kong Chinese children living in poverty.MethodsA feasibility randomised controlled trial will be conducted. A convenience sample of 120 children aged 13–17 years will be recruited from a community centre in Kwai Tsing district. Participants who are randomised into the experimental group will join a 1.5-hour workshop covering four positive psychology techniques: (1) gratitude visits/letters, (2) three good things, (3) you at your best and (4) using signature strengths. A booster intervention will be provided at 1 week. Control group participants will not receive any intervention. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and at 1-week, 1-month, 3-month and 6-month follow-ups.AnalysisDescriptive statistics will be used to calculate the feasibility measures. Effect sizes on psychological outcomes (ie, self-esteem, depressive symptoms and quality of life) will be estimated by mixed between-within subjects analysis of variance using partial eta squared with poverty (yes, no) entering into the model as a factor.Ethics and disseminationEthical approval has been obtained from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Institutional Review Broad. We will obtain parental consent as our subjects are below 18 years old. Findings from this study will be disseminated via international publications and conferences.Trial registration numberNCT04875507.

AB  - Young adults who are pregnant or parents are a vulnerable subgroup of the homeless population, yet there is limited research about their specific service needs. To fill this gap, we used data from a survey of homeless and unstably housed young adults, ages 18-24, collected over 4 weeks in Houston, Texas, to examine the characteristics, risk factors, and protective factors of homeless parents (n = 109) compared to other homeless young adults (n = 243), then differences between mothers (n = 61) and fathers (n = 48). Unique risk and protective profiles for homeless parents were identified, as well as differences between mothers and fathers. Implications for service delivery targeted to the unique needs of young adult homeless mothers and fathers are discussed.

AB  - This pilot exploratory study evaluated the impact of the Young Mothers' Prenatal Group (YMPG) on single adolescent mothers' health and social outcomes. The YMPG provides comprehensive health and social intervention to pregnant and parenting adolescents aged 16 to 21 who are at risk for decreased health and social outcomes. The YMPG is a two-day prenatal seminar with informal prenatal and postnatal case management follow-up, and a one-day postpartum reunion. YMPG is based in one inner-city Toronto hospital. Young mothers delivering at a comparable inner-city Toronto hospital which does not have an adolescent prenatal program were included as a comparison group. Intervention mothers (n = 37) were followed from prenatal to postpartum status (before intervention, shortly after childbirth, and three months postpartum). Comparison mothers (n = 30) were surveyed at childbirth and at three months postpartum. Three primary outcome variables were examined: social support (Medical Outcomes Social Support Survey), depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and maternal confidence (Pharis Self-Confidence Scale). This research draws on an integration of two existing theoretical approaches (Social Networks and Social Support, and Social Cognitive Theory). The findings from this pilot study, using repeated measures MANCOVA, indicated that young mothers in the intervention group had significantly higher levels of maternal confidence than young mothers in the comparison group at three months postpartum. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in the levels of social support and depression. Analysis focused solely on the intervention group, using one-way repeated measures ANOVA, indicated a significant time effect from the prenatal to three-month postpartum period in the intervention group on each of the three main outcomes: social support, maternal confidence and depression. In addition, the analysis revealed that inner-city Canadian young mothers are a highly disadvantaged population with many problems including depression, poverty, and housing and food insecurity. It appears that the YMPG has an effect on maternal confidence but does not have a large effect on young mothers' levels of social support and depression. Future evaluations would benefit from a more intensive intervention, longer-term evaluations, much larger samples and a methodologically stronger design.

AB  - Homelessness is associated with a range of negative health and behavioral outcomes, yet life-course pathways to homelessness from adolescence to early adulthood are not well-documented. This study asks to what extent do early-mid adolescent risk and protective factors predict young adult homelessness, and whether the predictive nature of these factors is similar in Victoria, Australia, and Washington State in the USA. As part of the International Youth Development Study, adolescents were recruited as state representative secondary school samples at grade 7 (age 13, 2002) and longitudinally compared at average age 25. Higher rates of past year homelessness were reported by Washington State (5.24%), compared to Victorian young adults (3.25%). Although some cross-state differences in levels of adolescent demographic, individual, family, peer group, school, and community predictors were found, cross-state comparisons showed these factors were equally predictive of young adult homelessness in both states. In univariate analyses, most adolescent risk and protective factors were significant predictors. Unique multivariate adolescent predictors associated with young adult homelessness included school suspension (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.76) and academic failure (AOR = 1.94). No significant unique protective effects were found. Prevention and intervention efforts that support adolescents’ academic engagement may help in addressing young adult homelessness. The similar cross-state profile of adolescent predictors suggests that programs seeking to support academic engagement may influence risk for homelessness into young adulthood in both states. The similarity in life-course pathways to homelessness suggests that the USA and Australia can profitably translate prevention and intervention efforts to reduce homelessness while continuing to identify modifiable predictors.

AB  - Background The experience of homelessness and child protection involvement pose risks to children's school success. Elucidating processes by which these interrelated systems affect child well-being is important for guiding policy and practice. Objective This study examines the temporal relation between emergency shelter or transitional housing use and child protection involvement among school-aged children. We evaluated effects of both risk indicators on school attendance and school mobility. Participant and setting Using integrated administrative data, we identified 3278 children (ages 4 to 15) whose families used emergency or transitional housing in Hennepin and Ramsey County of Minnesota during the 2014 and 2015 academic years. A propensity-score-matched comparison group of 2613 children who did not use emergency or transitional housing. Method Through a series of logistic regressions and generalized estimating equations, we tested the temporal associations of emergency/transitional housing and child protection involvement as well as how both experiences affected school attendance and mobility. Results Experiences of emergency or transitional housing often proceeded or occurred concurrently with child protection involvement and increased the likelihood of child protection services. Emergency or transitional housing and child protection involvement posed risks for lower school attendance and greater school mobility. Conclusions A multisystem approach to assist families across social services may be important for stabilizing children's housing and bolstering their success at school. A two-generation approach focused on residential and school stability and enhancing family resources could boost adaptive success of family members across contexts.

AB  - Foster care placement is an important child welfare service to protect children from further maltreatment. However, high problem behavior rates among foster youth have been a great concern. Significant limitations in the current knowledge examining the role of foster care placement in later problem behavior exist. This study seeks to increase knowledge about the potential role of foster care placement in problem behavior (juvenile delinquency, runaway, teen pregnancy, and truancy) among foster care youth, based on ecological problem solving model. Research questions are: (1) does foster care placement predict problem behavior among children who received foster care compared to those receiving Family Preservation Service? (2) what aspects of foster care placement are associated with problem behavior? This study uses the sample from a larger longitudinal study investigating the life course of children involved with child welfare services in a Midwestern metropolitan area. The sample consists of children who experienced foster care placement, as well as a comparison group of children who had records of Family Preservation Service, but no foster care. All subjects were born between 1982 and 1994 and they were followed for the present study through 2006. For research question 1, the foster care group was divided into those who had foster care only and those with both foster care and FPS. Propensity score methods were used to make the groups comparable. Survival analyses found that foster care placement is associated with increased risk of juvenile delinquency, runaway, and teen pregnancy. However, the likelihood of the problem behavior was fully or partially offset by having Family Centered Services. Survival analyses of research question 2 found that foster care characteristics, such as placement for other reasons in addition to prior maltreatment, being older at first entry into foster care, staying in therapeutic setting for the first and the last placement, higher number of placement changes, and high number of foster cares spell predicted increased risk of one or multiple types of problem behavior. The constellation of variables and foster care characteristics varied for different outcome behaviors with the exception that FCS appeared consistently associated with reduced risk.

AB  - Purpose: We evaluate the efficacy of a short family intervention in reducing sexual risk behavior, drug use, and delinquent behaviors among homeless youth. Methods: A randomized controlled trial of 151 families with a homeless adolescent aged 12 to 17 years. Between March 2006 and June 2009, adolescents were recruited from diverse sites in Southern California and were assessed at recruitment (baseline), and at 3, 6, and 12 months later. Families were randomly assigned to an intervention condition with five weekly home-based intervention sessions or a control condition (standard care). Main outcome measures reflect self-reported sexual risk behavior, substance use, and delinquent behaviors over the past 90 days. Results: Sexual risk behavior (e.g., mean number of partners; p < .001), alcohol use (p = .003), hard drug use (p < .001), and delinquent behaviors (p = .001) decreased significantly more during 12 months in the intervention condition compared with the control condition. Marijuana use, however, significantly increased in the intervention condition compared with the control condition (p < .001). Conclusions: An intervention to reengage families of homeless youth has significant benefits in reducing risk over 12 months.

AB  - Research to date has given little attention to differences in the experience of youth homelessness by ethnicity. This article provides a comparative descriptive analysis of the effect of differences and similarities in paths to homelessness, self-perception, and survival strategies on health behaviors and consequent health outcomes of African American and white homeless youth in San Francisco, USA. We conducted participant observation and ethnographic interviews with 54 youth primarily recruited from street venues. Hypotheses generated from the ethnographic data were validated in between-group analyses using concurrent epidemiological data collected from a sample of 205 youth. Our samples of unstably housed African American and white youth, though sharing common histories of family dysfunction, differed in both the ethnographic accounts and epidemiological analyses in their experiences of family, access to housing, street survival strategies, self-presentation, health behaviors and service utilization. Our sample of white youth generally identified with the term 'homeless,' engaged in survival activities associated with such a label, and accessed the services intended to address the needs of homeless youth. In contrast, our sample of African American youth generally did not perceive themselves as 'homeless,' a stigmatized term, and were thus less likely to utilize, or be accessed by, relevant services.

AB  - BackgroundWhile some recent research has addressed homeless youth from a strengths-based approach, comparative studies of homeless and non-homeless youth from a strengths perspective are few; research that includes youth's views on positive youth development are also limited.ObjectiveAddressing these gaps and using an inductive approach, adolescents' views on positive development and their strengths were solicited. This study investigated the qualitative differences in views on doing well, strengths and positive development from two youth samples: youth who were homeless and resident youth involved in a 4-H program.MethodsThirty-eight adolescents participated in focus groups, including five groups from a homeless shelter and five groups from a 4-H program. Content analysis of the narrative responses was conducted.ResultsDifferences between homeless and 4-H adolescents were found in the areas of happiness, family support, identity, personal strengths, and risk avoidance. Homeless youth revealed adaptation to limiting ecologies (e.g., non-supportive parents) as they sought out other supportive relationships instead and adjusted their views of happiness. Homeless adolescents demonstrated more internal self-awareness compared to 4-H adolescents.ConclusionsBy recognizing and capitalizing on the unique perspectives and strengths of adolescents from divergent environments, positive youth development and strengths-based programs and theory can more effectively benefit youth from diverse backgrounds. Understanding youth's views that have normative and non-normative experiences (i.e., non-homeless and homeless) helps further expand the boundaries of developmental models and address how to promote thriving in youth from various contexts.

AB  - Men who have sex with men (MSM) experience high prevalence of sexual violence (SV), and SV has well-documented effects on health. Research gaps are especially evident for young Black MSM (YBMSM), who experience significant HIV disparities and syndemics, including multiple forms of violence victimization. We examined lifetime prevalence of SV (having been forced or frightened into sexual activity) in a cross-sectional sample of YBMSM (N = 1732), and tested associations of demographic, psychosocial, and structural factors using multivariable regression. YBMSM were recruited between 2013 and 2015 using modified venue-based time-location sampling (e.g., at bars and clubs) in Dallas and Houston, Texas. Approximately 17% of YBMSM experienced any SV in their lifetimes. SV was associated with high school non-completion (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.15–2.77), lower psychological resilience (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.71–0.98), lifetime history of homelessness (OR 5.52; 95% CI 3.80–8.02), recent financial hardship (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.48–3.14), and recent transactional sex (OR 3.87; 95% CI 2.43–6.15). We also examined differences by age of SV onset (childhood versus adulthood). YBMSM with adolescent/emerging adult-onset SV may have been more ambivalent in reporting lifetime SV experience, compared to men with childhood-onset SV, and correlates differed by age of onset. Childhood-onset SV was associated with high school non-completion, lower levels of psychological resilience, history of homelessness, recent financial hardship, and recent transactional sex. Adolescent/emerging adult-onset SV was associated with greater depressive symptoms, history of homelessness, and recent financial hardship. There is a need for multi-level approaches to SV prevention and treatment, including services and supports that are culturally-relevant and responsive to the needs of YBMSM.

AB  - Objective This study was designed to address the need for more detailed information about Indigenous homeless youth, a group overrepresented in the homeless population, using a national-level data set. Study design The study used a cross-sectional, self-report survey design. Methods Surveys were used to gather demographic, mental health, and quality of life data from a sample of 1103 Canadian youth accessing homeless services with data collected in 2015. This article focused on the 332 Indigenous respondents, using both comparisons with non-Indigenous youth and within-group comparisons across key domains. Results These findings suggested greater mental health and addiction challenges among Indigenous homeless youth compared with non-Indigenous respondents as well as evidence of a more problematic role of child protection. Within-group comparisons suggested that female and sexual and gender minority youth are particularly at risk among Indigenous youth with some added child protection and justice implications for reserve-raised youth. Child protection history and street-victimization were particularly relevant to the current distress levels. Conclusion Overall, such findings reinforce calls for Indigenous-specific interventions for these populations-including policy-driven prevention initiatives to address the legacy of colonization.

AB  - Teenagers' running from foster placement is a significant problem in the field of child protection. This article describes a functional, behavior analytic approach to reducing running away through assessing the motivations for running, involving the youth in the assessment process, and implementing interventions to enhance the reinforcing value of placements for adolescents, thereby reducing the probability of running and associated unsafe periods. A case study illustrates this approach and a study compares 13 adolescents who ran away frequently and received interventions with a group of matched adolescents who had similar patterns of running but received only services as usual. The percentage of days on runaway status showed a significant pre-post reduction for those in the functional group, in contrast to no statistical change in the comparison group. Potential benefits this approach may have for foster care and child protection in improving youth safety, permanence, and connections for life are discussed.

AB  - The comparative salience of attitudes, normative influences, & perceptions of the ease or difficulty of engaging in marijuana use was examined in 91 adolescents from three subsamples: those living in Nimbin, Australia, where marijuana use appears to have become normalized, a control group, & a group of homeless adolescents, surveyed in 1997. There were no differences between two of the groups in relation to their attitudes towards marijuana, & no differences in perceived access to the drug. For those who intended using marijuana, personal beliefs were significantly more salient than beliefs about what important others thought they should do. 4 Tables, 18 References.

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-risk behaviors among street youth were assessed by gender & housing status based on 429 structured interviews conducted in northern CA in 1993. Results revealed that less than 50% of the sample used condoms regularly, & almost 33% had used injection drugs. Females were as likely as males to use injection drugs, more likely to engage in sexual activity & be diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease, & less likely to use condoms consistently. Youth currently without housing reported higher rates of injection & other drug use. The high level of HIV risk behaviors among this sample of street youth suggests an urgent need for gender-specific prevention efforts & an increased range of housing options. 6 Tables, 43 References.

AB  - Objectives: Mindfulness-based interventions demonstrate promise in helping individuals cultivate awareness of risks, thereby decreasing likelihood of revictimization; however, mindfulness-based approaches with homeless youth have received little empirical attention. This mixed-methods study investigates a mindfulness-based intervention for homeless youth, investigating (a) quantitatively—to what extent is the intervention effective in increasing youths’ mindfulness over time? and (b) qualitatively—in observing homeless youths’ participation in the mindfulness groups, what strategies appear most helpful in engaging them in this mindfulness intervention and what challenges are encountered? Methods: Using a randomized experimental design, the current study pilot tests an intensive (3 day), skill-building intervention to train homeless youth (N = 97, ages 18–21 years) to practice mindfulness and avoid risks. Youths’ mindfulness was assessed via standardized self-report instruments at baseline and post-intervention (1 week post baseline for youth in the control condition). Results: Repeated-measures ANOVA results indicate that although no effect was found on total mindfulness, a significant effect was found for mindfulness subscales. Intervention youth improved in their observation skills significantly more than control youth (F[1] = 3.88, p< .05, partial-η2 = .05). Qualitatively, certain intervention strategies (i.e., facilitating, personal sharing, teaching, and peer activation) demonstrated notable utility in actively engaging youth in mindfulness material, whereas challenges (meeting basic needs, a fight or flight instinct, and a generalized distrust of service providers) created challenges in implementing mindfulness skills. Conclusion: The intervention improved youths’ attention to internal and external stimuli yet future iterations will need to continue to modify to meet the unique needs of this population.

AB  - In South Africa, adolescents and young adults (ages 15–24) are at risk of HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and unintended pregnancies. Recently, the Department of Basic Education has revised its sexuality education content and teaching strategies (using scripted lessons plans) as part of its life orientation curriculum. This paper presents the methodology and baseline results from the evaluation of the scripted lesson plans and supporting activities. A rigorous cluster-level randomized design with random assignment of schools as clusters is used for the evaluation. Baseline results from grade 8 female and male learners and grade 10 female learners demonstrate that learners are at risk of HIV and early and unintended pregnancies. Multivariable analyses demonstrate that household-level food insecurity and living with an HIV-positive person are associated with sexual experience and pregnancy experience. Implications are discussed for strengthening the current life orientation program for future scale-up by the government of South Africa.

AB  - School districts and other service providers are increasingly aware of the substantial mental health needs of students experiencing family homelessness. Past findings are mixed regarding whether homelessness conveys unique risk beyond the risks associated with extreme poverty. With prospective longitudinal data on homelessness experiences across childhood, we utilized latent profile analysis as a person‐centered approach to conceptualizing mental health outcomes in adolescence for 3,778 youth. We considered literal family homelessness as well as families living doubled‐up, and we employed propensity score matching to identify a comparison group of nonhomeless students balanced across a range of covariates to address systematic bias. Results indicated that students who experienced literal homelessness during childhood were significantly less likely to demonstrate profiles of resilience in mental health functioning. We considered our approach and findings in light of challenges and opportunities particularly relevant to the school context.

AB  - Your Family, Your Neighborhood (YFYN) was developed to strengthen parent-child relationships among families living in low-income and subsidized housing communities, using a dual-generation approach. Few, if any, family-based interventions with a primary focus of enhancing parent-child relationships target parents and their children between the ages of seven to 12 years living in subsidized housing communities. This study aimed to fill this gap and examine the effects of the YFYN intervention on parent-child relationships. This mixed-methods study was conducted in three low-income neighborhoods, in a city in the western United States. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was conducted on the entire quasi-experimental sample (N = 101) and a repeated measures ANOVA was conducted on the per protocol sample (N = 70). ITT analysis indicated no significant group by time differences. However, results of the two-way ANOVA on the per protocol sample revealed a significant group by time effect, with treatment families demonstrating improvements in the parent-child relationship from pre-assessment to post-assessment compared to the control group. Focus groups were conducted with parent participants in the treatment group, in which they indicated their parent-child relationships improved after participating in YFYN, including feeling closer to their children, improving communication, spending more time together, and eating dinner together as a family more often. This study offers preliminary findings regarding the effects of the YFYN intervention on the parent-child relationship for families living in low-income and subsidized housing communities. Future directions for family-based and neighborhood interventions are discussed.

AB  - Children who are homeless or in foster care change schools more often than their non-mobile peers. The impact of school mobility increases their risk of academic failure (Evans, 1996; Ingersoll, Scamman, & Eckerling, 1989; Mao, 1997, Mehana & Reynolds, 2003; Reynolds & Wolf, 1999). Laws enforcing the right of students to remain in their "original school of enrollment," help increase academic achievement. Two of these laws are the McKinney-Vento Act, a federal law protecting the rights of homeless youth (United States Department of Education, 2004), and AB490, a state law that supports the education of foster youth (Shea, Weinberg, & Zetlin, 2004). Both laws allow students to remain at their original school of enrollment so that they do not have to change schools even if their housing situation changes. Although these laws are in place, homeless and foster youth still tend to change schools more often than their housed peers. This study analyzes indicators of academic achievement including grade point averages, California Standard Test scores, attendance rates, credits earned, and suspensions for seventh through twelfth grade homeless, foster youth, and a non-mobile comparison group in the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 school years. Address moves and school moves were also analyzed for their impact on academic achievement. The statistical procedures used in this study include correlation coefficients, a canonical correlation, four 3 x 2 repeated measures ANOVAs, and a series of 11 one-way ANOVAs to analyze whether school mobility variables have a statistically significant impact on the academic achievement variables for homeless and foster youth when compared to a third group of non-mobile, or housed students. Almost all procedures yielded statistical differences between the non-mobile comparison group and homeless and foster youth, although there were very few differences found between the homeless and foster students in this study.

AB  - Purpose Youth face similar rates of homelessness across rural and urban areas, yet little is known about how the health of unstably housed youth varies by location. We assessed differences in health by location (city, suburb, town, and rural) and housing status among youth facing a range of unstable housing experiences. Methods This secondary data analysis from 8th, 9th, and 11th graders completing the 2019 Minnesota Student Survey examined youth who had experienced housing instability in the prior year (n = 10,757), including running away (48%) or experiencing homelessness (staying in shelter, couch-surfing, or rough sleeping) with (42%) or without (10%) an adult family member. We conducted multifactor analysis of variance to assess differences by location (urban, suburban, town, and rural) and housing experience for each of five health indicators: suboptimal health, depressive symptoms, suicide attempts, ≥2 sexual partners, and e-cigarette use. Results In main effects models, all health indicators varied based on housing status; suboptimal health, ≥2 sexual partners, and e-cigarette use also varied by location. Interaction models showed that unaccompanied homeless youth in suburbs reported poorer health compared with those in cities. Compared with suburbs, youth in towns were more likely to report ≥2 sexual partners (19.9%, 24.1%) and e-cigarette use (39.5%, 43.3%). Conclusions Our findings suggest that unstably housed youth face a similar burden of poor health across locations, with only subtle differences in health indicators, yet most research focuses on urban youth. Future research is needed to identify how to best meet the health needs of unstably housed youth across locations.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the effect of a life skills education intervention among male and female youth in Ibadan, Nigeria, on knowledge about prevention and safe sexual practices, sexual roles and responsibilities, HIV/AIDS, money management, assertiveness and communication through follow-up interviews four weeks and eight weeks following the intervention. The participants were 98 males and females, and part of an initial survey of social and health problems of street youths in Ibadan, Nigeria. They were locality-separated, with consecutive assignments to two groups of experimental (n = 54, exposure to a manual driven life skills education) and control (n = 44, non-exposure to life skills education, but attention given) participants, and evaluated subsequently at four weeks and then at eight-week follow-ups. At the four-week post-intervention assessment, the experimental group showed significantly increased scores in the knowledge of antisocial behaviour prevention (p < 0.01), about HIV/AIDS (p < 0.001), about safe sexual practices (p < 0.001), about social roles and responsibilities and about assertiveness and communication (p < 0.01). At eight-week follow-up assessment, substantial significant reductions in reported antisocial and unsafe sexual behaviours were observed across the experimental group compared with the control group. The results suggest that street youths can be empowered through life skills education but with limitation to safe sexual practices over a sustained period of time in Nigeria.

AB  - Background: Poppers use has become increasingly prevalent and is associated with elevated HIV risk among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in urban settings. However, knowledge regarding racial variations of poppers use and their psychosocial determinants to inform culturally-targeted interventions remain limited. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among YMSM recruited from two US metropolitan areas (Nashville, TN and Buffalo, NY) to investigate the differences of socio-environmental and mental health factors associated with poppers use and important HIV-related outcomes [e.g., HIV testing, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP, substance use, and risky sexual behaviors] among White and Black YMSM (i.e., YWMSM and YBMSM). Results: Among 347 YMSM aged 18-35 years, 32.3% reported poppers use. Notably, poppers-using YWMSM were more likely (p < 0.05) to report mental health burdens (e.g., depression, anxiety, loneliness), while poppers-using YBMSM were more likely (p < 0.05) to experience adverse social-environmental events (e.g., unstable housing, food insecurity, no health insurance, perceived HIV stigma, internalized homonegativity). Poppers-using YMSM showed a higher prevalence of sexual risk behaviors (e.g., event-level alcohol/drug use, condomless insertive/receptive anal sex, group sex) compared to their non-user counterparts, with YWMSM showing the highest likelihood to engage in these risk behaviors. Compared to poppers-using YBMSM, poppers-using YWMSM were associated with a higher likelihood of ever testing for HIV, ever using PrEP and willingness to use PrEP in the next 12 months. Conclusion: Given the distinctive patterns of psychosocial determinants of poppers use between YWMSM and YBMSM, culturally-tailored poppers reduction programs should be designed to tackle the associated HIV risks among YMSM with effectivenes.

AB  - Community-based youth shelters are the primary method of intervention designed to meet the complex needs of at-risk youth who leave home before they have developed the skills to live independently. This research examines shelter users' patterns of cross-sector service use to better understand the needs and resources of shelter residents. The aims of this study are (1) to perform an inter-group analysis, comparing sheltered youth with status offense runaways and foster care runaways, and (2) to explore the population of emergency shelter residents using an intra-group analysis, determining whether distinct profiles of sheltered youth exist, based on individual characteristics and service use patterns over time. The study samples were drawn from a larger longitudinal study of services and outcomes. The samples included subjects born between 1981 and 1992 who were reported for child maltreatment and/or lived in families receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children during childhood. For the first Aim, the sample included subjects identified as runaway by the court system (status offense runaways), foster care runaways, and sheltered youth. The sample for the second aim included only sheltered youth. Bivariate analyses found differences between runaway groups in terms of poverty, maltreatment history, school-identified disability, report of neglect, receipt of family services, delinquent offenses, truancy, ethnicity, and parent mental health or substance abuse treatment. Controlling for covariates in the multinomial logistic regression, only age discriminated between all three groups. Just 20% of the sheltered youth ran away from their previous residence or spent time living on the street. Latent class analysis suggests sheltered youth fall into four clearly distinct categories, clearly defined by connection to school and family. These include: (1) a 'parent time-out' group (attending school and living with family), (2) a school/behavior problem group (not attending school and living with family), (3) youth in DFS custody placed at the shelter (disconnected from family but attending school), and (4) multi-problem youth (disconnected from both school and family).

AB  - In this study, I compared the shifts in attitude of affluent high school seniors participating in a course on social justice issues to a control group of similar adolescents. In this course, participating adolescents learned about social justice issues such as homelessness, poverty, world hunger, and illegal immigration. An analysis of presurvey and postsurvey data revealed that the adolescents participating in the social justice course experienced a decline over the course of the semester in their support for educational equity between wealthy and poor communities. Interviews with these adolescents and analyses of their student work revealed that their shifts in attitude were influenced by fears about the possibility of one day becoming poor or homeless themselves.

AB  - The current study employs data from the U.S. National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 10,818; 56% female; 21% African American) to test how experiencing homelessness through emerging adulthood and child maltreatment predict adult property crime and violent crime. Unlike many published studies on homelessness, we used propensity score matching to correct for selection bias between homeless and nonhomeless individuals. Logistic regression models were run to predict violent and property crime in adulthood, controlling for child maltreatment. Participants who experienced homelessness by age 26 were 1.6 times more likely to commit violent crime in adulthood and almost 30% more likely to commit property crime. Those who were victims of child maltreatment were 15 times more likely to commit property crime, but no more likely to commit violent crime. Findings show that comparing statistically equivalent groups, homelessness through emerging adulthood significantly predicted adult criminality while child maltreatment showed more variable results. Greater prevention efforts aimed at children and adolescents at high risk of experiencing homelessness, as well as more intensive outreach services to homeless youth, may moderate exposure and reduce reliance on criminal survival behaviors.

AB  - Background: People experiencing homelessness have higher rates of HIV than those who are stably housed. Mental health needs, substance use problems, and issues unique to homelessness such as lack of shelter and transiency need to be considered with regard to HIV prevention. To date, HIV prevention interventions for young adults experiencing homelessness have not specifically addressed modifiable real-time factors such as stress, sexual or drug use urge, or substance use, or been delivered at the time of heightened risk. Real-time, personalized HIV prevention messages may reduce HIV risk behaviors.Objective: This pilot study tested the initial efficacy of an innovative, smartphone-based, just-in-time adaptive intervention that assessed predictors of HIV risk behaviors in real time and automatically provided behavioral feedback and goal attainment information.Methods: A randomized attention control design was used among young adults experiencing homelessness, aged 18-25 years, recruited from shelters and drop-in centers in May 2019. Participants were randomized to either a control or an intervention group. The intervention (called MY-RID [Motivating Youth to Reduce Infection and Disconnection]) consisted of brief messages delivered via smartphone over 6 weeks in response to preidentified predictors that were assessed using ecological momentary assessments. Bayesian hierarchical regression models were used to assess intervention effects on sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, and their corresponding urges.Results: Participants (N=97) were predominantly youth (mean age 21.2, SD 2.1 years) who identified as heterosexual (n=51, 52%), male (n=56, 57%), and African American (n=56, 57%). Reports of sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, stress, and all urges (ie, sexual, drug, alcohol) reduced over time in both groups. Daily drug use reduced by a factor of 13.8 times over 6 weeks in the intervention group relative to the control group (Multimedia Appendix 4 ). Lower urges for sex were found in the intervention group relative to the control group over the duration of the study. Finally, there was a statistically significant reduction in reports of feeling stressed the day before between the intervention and control conditions (P=.03).Conclusions: Findings indicate promising intervention effects on drug use, stress, and urges for sex in a hard-to-reach, high-risk population. The MY-RID intervention should be further tested in a larger randomized controlled trial to further investigate its efficacy and impact on sexual risk behaviors.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03911024; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03911024

AB  - Using data from a prospective cohort design study of a group of children with documented histories of abuse and neglect (n = 908) and matched controls (n = 667), this paper examines whether problem behaviors (e.g., prostitution, crime, school problems, and homelessness) in young adulthood explain the link between maltreatment in childhood and living in high-risk neighborhoods in middle adulthood. Problem behaviors were assessed at mean age of 29 and neighborhood characteristics were assessed at mean age of 40. Child maltreatment predicted living in less desirable neighborhoods in middle adulthood. Problem behaviors in young adulthood partially mediated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and residence in less desirable neighborhoods in middle adulthood. The direct paths from child maltreatment to neighborhoods were not significant for Black children. For White children, there was a direct relationship between child maltreatment and living in an economically disadvantaged neighborhood. Problem behaviors were a stronger mediator between child maltreatment and living in more disordered and less socially cohesive neighborhoods for Black children, while the problem behaviors were a stronger mediator for living in more economically disadvantaged and less socially cohesive neighborhoods for White children. Further research is needed to understand these racial differences. Interventions should focus on preventing problem behaviors to minimize the risk of residency in high-risk neighborhoods.

AB  - The Family Partnerships Program (FPP) is an intensive case management model that serves families with child welfare and juvenile justice involved youth who are at imminent risk of out-of-home placement. FPP is based on the belief that relationships, both with families and across systems, is foundational when supporting change with youth. Propensity score matching was utilized to determine if FPP is related to improved child welfare re-involvement outcomes when compared with treatment as usual for this population. When compared to non-FPP youth in two comparison counties, FPP youth from Larimer County, Colorado experienced 51% lower odds of juvenile justice involvement at case closure compared to remaining home, 32% lower odds of runaway/emancipation compared to remaining home, and 74% lower odds of placement compared to remaining home. When comparing a group of youth from Larimer County who did not receive FPP to youth in the comparison counties, the results are similar. Although this effect does not appear to be isolated to FPP; one possibility is that intensive case management represents an “active ingredient” of what makes Larimer County’s community-based approach viable for serving the crossover youth population. Implications for program and policy development and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of quality of life therapy in a group manner on the life of homeless and abused girls in Isfahan boarding schools. This research was conducted in a quasi-experimental manner with a pre-test-post-test and follow-up design. The statistical population of this study is 200 people among the girls aged 12-18; they were homeless and abused in the boarding schools of Isfahan province coincidentally, 30 people were divided into two groups of 15 people tested and controlled. The measurement tool in this study was the test questionnaire to guide the lives of Shea and Carver (1985) which was completed by orphaned and abused girls in the pre-test, post-test and follow-up stages. Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics of repeated measurement analysis of variance were used to investigate research hypotheses. Results: The results showed that the difference between the meanings of the experimental and control groups in the post-test and follow-up with the control of pretest scores in the life orientation variables was significant and the quality of life training course increased optimism and decreased pessimism. Girls are orphaned and orphaned (p>0.01). Also, the effect of this intervention has not changed or decreased over time (p<0.05) and the effect of the training course in the follow-up phase has remained relatively constant. Discussion and Conclusion: According to the obtained results, it is stated that quality of life training courses can increase optimism, life satisfaction and ultimately increase people's well-being.

AB  - Providing stable housing for runaway and homeless youth is a major function of a transitional living program. This article introduces the focus of one program working with LGBTQ youth in New York City and discusses some issues to consider when working with this population. The article also presents data associated with young people's lives after discharge. In any discussion of outcomes, both reason for discharge and length of stay play important roles in whether or not an exit is safe. Regardless of these two elements, the places youth move to when leaving programs are crucial to their safety and well-being. The exit can be safe even when a young person is discharged early from a program. This article presents types of exits, as well as status of employment and school enrollment at exit. Some youth and staff-identified lessons gained in the program also are discussed in detail. Types of aftercare services sought by discharged youth are specified. This article also describes any differences in outcomes for youth with and without foster care experience. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a brief intervention to promote responsible substance use and safe sex behaviors in youths experiencing homelessness (YEH). Methods: Design: A Solomon four-group (double randomized controlled trial) longitudinal design with repeated measures (3- and 6-month follow-ups) was used in drop-in centers for YEH in Austin, Texas and Columbus, Ohio from which 602 youths, 18-24 years-old (M = 21 ± 1.8), 50% white; 69.9% heterosexual were recruited. A manualized one-on-one intervention consisted of six modules delivered via laptop computers. Modules focused on communication, goal-setting, substance use refusal, safe sex behaviors, enhanced psychological capital (hope, optimism, resilience, self-efficacy, gratitude), and life satisfaction. Valid and reliable measures of hope, optimism, future time perspective, resilience, social connectedness, gratitude, condom intention, self-efficacy for safe sex, safe sex behaviors, self-efficacy for substance use refusal, and life satisfaction were used to collect data for which three hypotheses were tested, using intent to treat, with multi-level modeling (R). Results: The analysis showed partial support for all hypotheses: (1) post-test outcomes were greater than pretests; (2) intervention group outcomes were greater than control group measures; and (3) significant effects for pretesting. YEH in Ohio completed significantly more sessions than YEH in Texas (p = .001), but took significantly longer to complete all six sessions (p = .001). Discussion: This brief intervention had significant effects on YEH to promote healthy attitudes and behaviors that merit further testing in larger samples.

AB  - Background Families with children under age six participating in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program (TANF) must participate in work-related activities for 20 h per week. However, due to financial hardship, poor health, and exposure to violence and adversity, families may experience great difficulty in reaching self-sufficiency. The purpose of this report is to describe study design and baseline findings of a trauma-informed financial empowerment and peer support intervention meant to mitigate these hardships.Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial of a 28-week intervention called Building Wealth and Health Network to improve financial security and maternal and child health among caregivers participating in TANF. Participants, recruited from County Assistance offices in Philadelphia, PA, were randomized into two intervention groups (partial and full) and one control group. Participants completed questionnaires at baseline to assess career readiness, economic hardship, health and wellbeing, exposure to adversity and violence, and interaction with criminal justice systems.Results Baseline characteristics demonstrate that among 103 participants, there were no significant differences by group. Mean age of participants was 25 years, and youngest child was 30 months. The majority of participants were women (94.2 %), never married (83.5 %), unemployed (94.2 %), and without a bank account (66.0 %). Many reported economic hardship (32.0 % very low household food secure, 65.0 % housing insecure, and 31.1 % severe energy insecure), and depression (57.3 %). Exposure to adversity was prevalent, where 38.8 % reported four or more Adverse Childhood Experiences including abuse, neglect and household dysfunction. In terms of community violence, 64.7 % saw a seriously wounded person after an incident of violence, and 27.2 % had seen someone killed. Finally, 14.6 % spent time in an adult correctional institution, and 48.5 % of the fathers of the youngest child spent time in prison.Conclusions Baseline findings demonstrate that caregivers participating in TANF have suffered significant childhood adversity, adult violence exposure, and poverty-related stressors that can limit workforce success. High prevalence of housing and food insecurity, exposure to adversity, violence and criminal justice systems demands comprehensive programming to support families. Trauma-informed approaches to career readiness such as the Building Wealth and Health Network offer opportunities for potential success in the workforce.Trial registration This study is retrospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.govThe Identifier is: NCT02577705The Registration date is October 13, 2015

AB  - National questionnaire & qualitative interview data from 208 young homeless people, ages 12-25, in Australia reveal a marked contrast between their mainly safe injecting practices & mainly unsafe sexual practices. Young people's stories of the culture & practices surrounding injecting were encouraging in the attention given to notions of responsibility & care for others, & a coherent discourse of belief in "safe" injecting practices was evident. A notion of the "druggie" or responsible drug user was contrasted with the "junkie" or irresponsible user in the culture of drug use. Conversely, reported sexual behaviors revealed neither consistent discourses about safe sex, nor an unambiguously expressed personal commitment to safe sex. Analysis of the differences between sex & drug use talk & the potential implications for intervention are considered. 19 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Follow-up rates reported among longitudinal studies that focus on runaway adolescents and their families are relatively low. Identifying factors associated with follow-up completion might be useful for improving follow-up rates and therefore study validity. The present study explored how individual- and family-level constructs, as well as research project activities, influence the follow-up completion rate among runaway adolescents (N = 140) and their primary caregiver. Results showed that follow-up completion rates decreased as the number of research assistants (RA) assigned to each case increased and as participants' address changes increased. Additionally, among adolescents, more frequent alcohol use was associated with lower follow-up rates. The current findings suggest that researchers should (1) design their research so that one RA is assigned to each specific case, and (2) adjust their retention strategies to account for the differences in follow-up rates based upon the participants' drug of choice and residential stability.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Purpose: This study provides information on how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is affecting emerging adults currently or recently homeless in terms of engagement in protective behaviors, mental health, substance use, and access to services. Methods: Ninety participants in an ongoing clinical trial of a risk reduction program for homeless, aged 18–25 years, were administered items about COVID-19 between April 10 and July 9, 2020. Results: Most participants reported engaging in COVID-19 protective behaviors. Past week mental health symptoms were reported by 38%–48% of participants, depending on symptoms. Among those who used substances before the outbreak, 16%–28% reported increased use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. More than half of the participants reported increased difficulty meeting basic needs (e.g., food), and approximately 32%–44% reported more difficulty getting behavioral health services since the outbreak. Conclusions: Innovative strategies are needed to address the increased behavioral health needs of young people experiencing homelessness during events such as the COVID-19 outbreak.

AB  - Problem: Various demographic & familial risk factors have been linked to runaway behavior. To date, there has not been a systematic investigation of the impact of size of community on runaway behavior. This study will compare runaways from smaller cities & rural areas to their urban counterparts. Methods: A convenience sample of 602 adolescents was interviewed between 1995 & August of 1996 in Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, & Kansas, USA. Multiple regression was used to examine the association between gender, neglect, sexual abuse, physical abuse, geographic & family structure change, & community size of first runaway to predict age at first runaway, deviant subsistence strategies, & street victimization. Results: Findings indicate that adolescents exposed to neglect (b = -.20) & sexual abuse (b = -.16) ran away sooner & were more likely to be victimized on the street. Rural adolescents who experienced higher levels of physical abuse relied more heavily on deviant subsistence strategies (b = .15) & remained in abusive homes longer (b = .15) than their similarly situated urban counterparts. Conclusions: Rural youth who have been subjected to elevated levels of familial abuse are at greater risk of deviant subsistence strategies, which increase the likelihood of street victimization.

AB  - Purpose: This study provides information on COVID-19 vaccination and attitudes among young adults with recent experiences of homelessness. Methods: Participants (n = 134) from a clinical trial of a risk reduction program for youth experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles completed survey items about COVID-19 vaccinations between March and October 2021. Results: A total of 29% of respondents were vaccinated, and 50% were not interested in getting vaccinated. Among the unvaccinated, 58% had not been offered the vaccine; furthermore, 38%–45% had strong distrust of the vaccine and were worried about its harmfulness. Vaccination status was generally unrelated to demographics, housing instability, service use, substance use, or mental health. Discussion: Our data suggest that vaccination rates are lower among young adults with recent experiences of homelessness than those in the general US population. The results suggest a need for greater direct outreach that includes both offering the vaccine and addressing misconceptions about its safety to increase vaccination rates in this population.

AB  - Reviews several empirical studies of homelessness in GB to argue that policies to assist homeless youth should be integrated & address the needs of the entire homeless population, not only young males sleeping outside. A survey of 200+ agencies in four London boroughs & seven other British cities found that the majority of homeless young people (ages 16-25) in five of the cities & parts of London are women, a fact obscured by statistics that distinguish between single & family homelessness & by research based on counts of street sleepers. Young homeless women are often partnered or separated & are more likely than their male counterparts to sleep in hostels or the homes of friends & relatives. It is also noted that the homeless population is less white & more black than apparent in Rough Sleepers Initiative programs. 6 Tables, 1 Figure, 41 References. E. Blackwell

AB  - This paper explores the lives of formerly homeless young people as they transitioned towards housing stability. The study employed a longitudinal design involving 51 street youth in Halifax, NS and Toronto, ON. This paper sheds light upon the pathways through young people transitioned a way from homelessness using the developmental lens of emerging adulthood: a stage involving numerous developmental struggles (identity, instability, self focus, feeling in-between) but also an age filled with hope and possibilities. There are numerous interrelated factors at play that allow participants to regain a sense of citizenship with mainstream society. While housing in itself did not shape these young people's sense of stability, it influenced feelings of health, happiness and security. Yet, our participants, as a particular segment of the youth population who have transitioned out of basic homelessness, continue to describe their current lives in terms of fragility and instability. For most, opportunity for experimentation and identity exploration was often curtailed by processes outside of their control and struggles with the consequences of profound disempowerment -- past trauma with family and/or current struggles with public sector structures and services. As a result, many felt abandoned and stigmatized by the very resources whose mission it is to assist.

AB  - Purpose: Runaway adolescents often have strained relationships with their parents. Given parental support is an important protective resource for traumatized young people, understanding differences in support within parent–adolescent relationships could aid in designing more effective interventions. We hypothesized (1) runaway adolescents seen at a Child Advocacy Center (CAC) would have poorer parental relationships than adolescents without a history of running away and (2) severity of diagnosed sexual violence would be associated with lower parental connectedness. Methods: Data were from 2,042 adolescents aged 10–19 years and their parents evaluated for any reason at our hospital-based CAC from 2008 to 2017. Parent–adolescent relationship scales were completed by adolescents and at least one parent/guardian (usually mothers). Sexual abuse was stratified at four levels, higher levels indicating increasingly severe forms of abuse. T-tests and analyses of variance to tested relationships between supportive and controlling parental behaviors by runaway status, and, among runaways, by the severity of sexual abuse. Results: Runaway adolescents comprised 58.3% of adolescents seen at the CAC; runaways reported lower parental support and higher parental controlling than patients without a history of running away. Those with the most severe forms of sexual abuse (including sexual exploitation and gang rape) reported the least supportive and most controlling relationships with parents, as did their parents. Conclusions: Findings support our clinical observations that polyvictimization of adolescents who have spent significant time as runaways may further strain parent–adolescent relationships. Future clinical research should focus on developing interventions to promote parental connectedness after a runaway episode.

AB  - Background: Nonmedical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD) is an urgent public health concern facing the United States. Young adults experiencing homelessness (YEH) are at increased risk of NMUPD; however, community estimates of NMUPD among YEH are sparse. This current study sought to understand patterns and correlates of NMUPD in a geographically heterogeneous sample of YEH recruited from seven cities across the United States. Methods: From June 2016 to July 2017, 1,426 YEH (aged 18–26) were recruited from seven cities (Houston, Los Angeles, Denver, Phoenix, New York City, St. Louis, San Jose). Participants provided information on substance use, mental health, trauma, and sexual-risk behaviors. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to assess demographic, psychological, and behavioral correlates of self-reported past-month NMUPD and NMUPD types (i.e., prescription stimulant, sedative, and opioids). Results: Approximately 20% of participants reported past-month NMUPD. Almost 9% reported misusing prescription opioids, 8.7% misused prescription sedatives, and 6% misused prescription stimulants. Multivariable logistic regressions revealed unmet mental health needs were associated with sedative and stimulant misuse but not opioid misuse. Having suicidal thoughts was associated with opioid misuse but not sedative or stimulant misuse. Although no geographical differences emerged for stimulant and sedative misuse, youth from Denver, Phoenix, and San Jose were more likely to engage in opioid misuse relative to youth in Los Angeles. Conclusions: These findings indicate that interventions designed to address NMUPD need to be multifaceted, designed to address other risk behaviors correlated with NMUPD, and target unmet mental health needs.

AB  - In light of recent studies that have questioned the prevalence of abuse experienced by teenage runaways & the causal contribution of such abuse to runaway experiences, offered here are descriptive data on the occurrence, nature, & frequency of physical abuse experienced in a sample of 195 Canadian adolescent runaways at a shelter in Toronto, Ontario. Structured interview data also reveal the age of onset & duration of abuse, the relationship between the victim & the perpetrator(s), & who, if anyone, knew of the abuse. Abuse experienced prior & subsequent to runaway experiences is compared. Results indicate that 86% of the population (74% of the males & 90% of the females) reported at least 1 physically abusive experience. As a whole, these adolescents have been victims of chronic, extreme abuse, experienced at a young age, often perpetrated by the biological parent (most often the mother), & initiated prior to the first runaway episode. Female runaways were at greater risk than males for all types of abuse experience. Once youths left home, the physical abuse experiences decreased in frequency, but grew in severity, particularly for males. 6 Tables, 39 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Young adults experiencing homelessness are at high risk of opioid and other substance use, poor mental health outcomes, exposure to trauma, and other risks. Providing access to stable housing has the potential to act as a powerful preventive intervention, but supportive housing programs have been studied most often among chronically homeless adults or adults with serious mental illness. The Housing First model, which does not precondition supportive housing on sobriety, may reduce drug use in homeless adults. In the present study, we piloted an adapted model of Housing First plus prevention services that was tailored to the needs of young adults (18–24 years) experiencing homelessness in the USA. Preventive services were added to the Housing First model and included youth-centered advocacy services, motivational interviewing, and HIV risk prevention services. This model was piloted in a single-arm study (n = 21) to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of a Housing First model over a 6-month period in preparation for a larger randomized trial. We use repeated measures ANOVA to test for changes in alcohol and drug use (percent days of use; alcohol or drug use consequences), housing stability, social network support, and cognitive distortions over 6 months of follow-up. A total of 17 youth completed the study (85% retention), and a high proportion of youth were stably housed at 6-month follow-up. Participation in intervention services was high with an average of 13.57 sessions for advocacy, 1.33 for MI, and 0.76 for HIV prevention. Alcohol use did not change significantly over time. However, drug use, drug use consequences, and cognitive distortions, and the size of youths’ social networks that were drug using individuals decreased significantly. The Housing First model appeared to be feasible to deliver, and youth engaged in the supportive intervention services. The study demonstrates the potential for an adapted Housing First model to be delivered to youth experiencing homelessness and may improve outcomes, opening the way for larger randomized trials of the intervention.

AB  - Background and objectives: Adolescents in foster care are at high risk for cigarette smoking. However, it is not clear how their smoking behaviors vary by gender. The present study examined lifetime and current smoking among males and females, and explored gender-specific risk factors for engagement in smoking behaviors. Method: Data from the Multi Site Evaluation of Foster Youth Programs was used to evaluate patterns of smoking among adolescents aged 12-18 years (N = 1121; 489 males, 632 females). Results: Males and females did not differ significantly in rates of lifetime and current smoking, or in the age of smoking initiation and number of cigarettes smoked on a typical day. Gender-based analyses revealed that older age and placement in group homes or residential treatment facilities were associated with heightened risk of smoking among males. In contrast, sexual minority status (i.e., nonheterosexual orientation) and increased childhood victimization were associated with heightened risk of smoking among females. A history of running away was linked to smoking in both genders. Conclusion: Gender should be considered when designing intervention programs to address cigarette smoking among foster youth, as the stressors associated with smoking may differ for males and females.

AB  - Using secondary analyses of data from a sample of 265 sexual minority youths, the authors examined correlates of cutting behavior to determine whether patterns are similar to those found in studies of self-injury with community samples of predominately heterosexual youths. The sample consisted of youths who received services at an urban social service agency serving the sexual minority community; youths from the region attending social events, who located the survey through the Internet, or who were referred from other youth-serving agencies; and youths from out of state who found the survey through the Internet or were referred by youth-serving agencies. Prevalence of cutting was higher than that found in community-based samples of similar age groups. However, similar patterns of risk were found with regard to peer victimization, homelessness, suicidality, and depression. Female and transgender respondents were more likely to have engaged in cutting behavior than were male respondents. No significant race-based differences emerged. Both age and having knowledge of a supportive adult were associated with decreased likelihood of cutting. Additional findings link higher levels of "outness," higher occurrence of suicidality among social network, and higher rates of smoking to increased likelihood of cutting. Implications for practice and future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Prior research reveals high unemployment rates among homeless young adults. The literature offers many examples of using evidence-based supported employment models with vulnerable populations to assist them in obtaining and maintaining competitive employment; yet few examples exist to date with homeless young adults with mental illness.The purpose of this study was thus to adapt an evidence-based intervention for adults with psychiatric illnesses [i.e., the Individual Placement and Support (IPS)] with homeless young adults with mental illness.Convenience sampling was used to recruit 20 homeless young adults (ages 18-24) with mental illness from the host agency. Participants received the IPS intervention over 10 months. A comparison sample was used at a separate agency of 16 homeless young adults with mental illness, who received standard agency services. Using a pre-post, self-comparison quasi-experimental design, the impact of the IPS was assessed on five employment outcomes: (1) ever-worked rate, (2) working-at-follow-up rate, (3) monthly work rate, (4) weekly work hours and (5) weekly income.The IPS group was significantly more likely to have worked at some point over the 10-month study as well as to have worked a greater number of months overall.Findings provide greater insight into adapting, implementing and evaluating the IPS model with homeless young adults with mental illness. The study demonstrates that the IPS model is adaptable to work with homeless young adults with mental illness and is associated with successful retention and employment outcomes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to describe the attempts by one youth homelessness service to implement the conceptual ideas of the psychologically informed environment (PIE) into a practical and beneficial service for very challenging young people who have been homeless, are leaving care or have left custody. Design/methodology/approach – The approach of the paper is descriptive, outlining the thinking behind a PIE with young people and the operationalising of this understanding in the day-to-day practice of the service. Findings – Although homelessness and housing support staff are not therapists, the nature of the work entails a need for understanding and sensitivity, and the activities of the service are designed to create positive opportunities and relationships. Reflective practice, supervision and evaluation are then essential tools in developing a “learning organisation”, where the collective dynamics at an organisational level support the psychological work of the PIE. Research limitations/implications – The implications for homelessness work that can be drawn from the outcome of this project is to better understand how the PIE linked to the concept of a learning organisation can provide a truly robust framework for providing a service that can evolve harmoniously, tying in disparate funding streams to offer very challenging young people an outstanding service that addresses their homelessness and its underlying causes. Practical implications – The practical implications shown are the psychological skills that can be developed in housing workers; the limits of those skills and how they are complemented by partnership work with other voluntary sector organisations and mainstream health providers; how the ideas of the learning organisation can naturally underpin the work of the PIE. Originality/value – The combination of the concept of the learning organisation, reflective practice and the PIE provides a highly original and truly robust framework for providing housing workers with the psychological tools to make a transformative difference in the lives of especially vulnerable young homeless people.

AB  - Investigates the effects of poverty in early adulthood on future earnings. Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979-1992 (N = 2,965 respondents) indicate that poverty does dampen earnings potential. However, individual characteristics (eg, aspirations, esteem, & ability) & structural location (eg, educational attainment, occupational status, & job tenure) may assuage the otherwise negative effects of poverty. Other findings reveal that the process shaping earnings is very similar for white males compared to racial minorities & women. One exception is the impact of weekly hours worked on earnings. White males receive a benefit to earnings from weekly hours worked above & beyond that of white women, African American men, African American women, & Mexican American women. Additionally, white men's earnings remain higher than the others because of higher occupational attainment & longer job tenure. 3 Tables, 2 Appendixes, 64 References.

AB  - Little is known about human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination uptake among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH), who may be at higher risk for HPV than their housed counterparts. We examined the prevalence and associations of HPV vaccination initiation and completion among YEH. Guided by the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, we analyzed cross-sectional data collected from YEH (N = 1074; ages 18–26) in seven U.S. cities to assess HPV vaccination prevalence and to identify predisposing, enabling, and need factors associated with HPV vaccination status. Due to timing differences in the release of HPV vaccine recommendations, we conducted separate logistic regression analyses for men (n = 673) and women (n = 401). Approximately 19% of men and 37% of women had initiated and completed HPV vaccination. Several factors among men (i.e., older age, Latinx ethnicity, San Jose or St. Louis residence compared with New York City, never having had sex, and not previously being tested for STIs) and women (i.e., lower education level, San Jose or Houston residence compared with New York City, and never having had sex) were associated with lower odds of HPV vaccination initiation, completion, or both. Gay men had higher odds of initiating and completing the vaccination series than their heterosexual counterparts. Our findings reveal that HPV vaccination uptake is low among YEH and that there are vaccination disparities among subgroups of YEH. HPV vaccination strategies and resources that are easy-to-understand, facilitate point-of-care services, and address societal and system-level vaccination barriers encountered by YEH are needed.

AB  - It is important to gain more insight into specific subgroups of homeless young adults (HYA) to enable the development of tailored interventions that adequately meet their diverse needs and to improve their quality of life. Within a heterogeneous sample of HYA, we investigated whether subgroups are distinguishable based on risk‐ and protective factors for quality of life. In addition, differences between subgroups were examined regarding the socio‐demographic characteristics, the use of cognitive coping strategies and quality of life. A total of 393 HYA using shelter facilities in the Netherlands were approached to participate, between December 2011 and March 2013. Structured face‐to‐face interviews were administered approximately 2 weeks after shelter admission by trained research assistants. A latent class analysis was conducted to empirically distinguish 251 HYA in subgroups based on common risk factors (former abuse, victimisation, psychological symptoms and substance use) and protective factors (resilience, family and social support and perceived health status). Additional analysis of variance and chi‐square tests were used to compare subgroups on socio‐demographic characteristics, the use of cognitive coping strategies and quality of life. The latent class analysis yielded four highly interpretable subgroups: the at‐risk subgroup, the high‐risk and least protected subgroup, the low‐risk subgroup and the higher functioning and protected subgroup. Subgroups of HYA with lower scores in risk factors showed higher scores in protective factors, the adaptive cognitive coping strategies and quality of life. Our findings confirm the need for targeted and tailored interventions for specific subgroups of HYA. Social workers need to be attentive to the pattern of risk‐ and protective factors in each individual to determine which risk factors are prominent and need to be targeted and which protective factors need to be enhanced to improve the quality of life of HYA.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to test whether there are gender differences in the prevalence of and correlates for various externalizing problem behaviors among secondary school adolescents in a southern city of China. Method: A large cross-sectional sample survey of 12,244 adolescents from Grade 7 to Grade 12 was conducted in Shenzhen, a metropolis in southern China. The participants completed measures assessing externalizing behaviors, positive youth development (PYD), family functioning, school maladjustment and sociodemographic characteristics. Multiple liner regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with externalizing problem behaviors among participants. Results: The results showed that (1) 35.1% of the sample displayed at least one externalizing problem behavior (i.e. alcohol consumption, tobacco use, running away from home, truancy, gang fighting, and stealing) during the previous year. Boys were more likely than girls to engage in all the examined behaviors. (2) Grade 11 was the peak of reported problem behaviors in the secondary school years and there was no difference between scores from participants in Grade 9 and Grade 7. (3) Having siblings, male gender, lower positive youth development level, lack of an intact family, lower family functioning, and school maladjustment were statistically significantly associated with more externalizing problem behaviors. (4) Four significant interactions were found between gender and Grade 11, gender and Grade 12, gender and PYD, and gender and school maladjustment. Boys in Grades 11 and 12, and with school maladjustment, and girls with lower PYD were more likely to report externalizing behaviors. Conclusions: The findings suggest that greater focus should be placed on late adolescent boys who have school difficulties, girls with low PYD levels, and adolescents with sibling(s), who are from non-intact families or who live in poor family environments, to prevent or intervene in the possibility of developing externalizing problem behaviors. Further Prevention and intervention work may require gender-specific design and school-home collaboration to impart positive youth qualities among adolescents.

AB  - A substantial body of evidence suggests that young people leaving public care systems are at increased risk for low educational attainment, unemployment, homelessness, physical & mental health difficulties, dependency on public assistance, & involvement with the criminal justice system. Independent living programs (ILPs), which incorporate life skills & personal development, are one strategy frequently used to improve outcomes for young people leaving care. However, the effectiveness of ILPs remains unknown. This paper systematically reviews the current evidence for ILPs, summarizing all controlled comparisons designed to evaluate their effectiveness. Reviewers were unable to find any randomized controlled trial evaluating ILPs, but the results of eight non-randomized controlled studies suggest that some ILPs may have protective effects for youth leaving the public care system. These trends were observed for outcomes related to educational attainment, employment, housing, health, & other life skills; nevertheless, the weak methodological quality of the evidence tempers the validity & generalizability of these conclusions. Further research utilizing random assignment of participants is imperative in order to draw reliable conclusions for policy & practice. [Copyright 2006 Elsevier B.V.]

In a sample of 17,790 cases from 1997, chi-square & ANOVA tests were calculated among the subgroups of youths, & maximum likelihood logistic regression analyses were used to examine the predictive power of several variables on whether the youths would return home. It was found that these three subgroups of runaways are heterogeneous, having disparate needs & unique characteristics that require different interventions & services. 2 Tables, 25 References. G.

AB  -  This study examined the HIV risk behaviors and life experiences of 151 transgender female youth, ages 15-24, in Los Angeles and Chicago. Descriptive analyses and logistic regression modeling were used to identify life factors associated with ever having engaged in sex work. Sixty-seven percent of participants had ever engaged in sex work and 19% self-reported being HIV positive. Many factors were significantly associated with sex work for this sample population. A final multivariate logistic regression model found that lower education status, homelessness, use of street drugs, and perceived social support remained significantly associated with sex work when controlling for other factors. Findings highlight the complex HIV risk environment and suggest a need for sex work initiation research for transgender female youth. HIV prevention efforts for this population need to include broad-based approaches that take into account individual, social, and community-level factors relevant to the lives of transgender female youth.

AB  - Homeless youth are adolescents and young adults who do not have stable dwellings but instead live on the streets, in shelters, or in other unstable situations. Although researchers have begun examining well‐being among this population, little is known about components of well‐being that are relevant to homeless youth or which factors predict differences in well‐being. This study examined psychological well‐being and its associations with demographic characteristics, intrapersonal factors (mental health, optimism, and self‐esteem), and social–contextual factors (social support, sense of community, and empowerment) among 100 youth experiencing homelessness. All of the intrapersonal and social–contextual variables were associated with well‐being at the bivariate level. In the full regression model, only self‐esteem and psychological distress remained significant. Findings inform future research and program development at homeless service centers.

AB  - Adolescents (N = 482) at elevated risk for sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome), were assessed on theoretically derived measures of knowledge & attitudes toward precautionary behavior, frequencies of high-risk sexual & substance use behaviors, & other psychosocial factors implicated in adolescents' risky behavior such as impulsivity, risk-taking propensity, & social support. The adolescent samples included 77 drug-dependent adolescents, 194 incarcerated youths, 55 homeless & runaway youths, & 156 urban African American adolescents from the US South. Drug-dependent & incarcerated youth evidenced exceedingly high HIV risk & less favorable psychosocial profiles, with drug-dependent females reporting the highest levels of overall risk. Youth in homeless shelters were lower in HIV risk & had more favorable psychosocial profiles than drug-dependent & incarcerated youth & were slightly higher on these measures than African American youth sampled from the community. Gender differences varied by sample. Findings suggest that HIV prevention programs for high-risk youth should be tailored according to gender & the specific type of high-risk audience involved. Implications of the findings for tailoring risk-reduction interventions for each group of at-risk adolescents are discussed. 5 Tables, 43 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Purpose: Homeless young adults often seek health care at emergency departments (EDs) after they are no longer able to ignore a pressing health problem. However, a dearth of literature examines homeless young adults' ED visits. This study aimed to increase understanding of ED visits among homeless young adults within the U.S. Methods: Data for this study were obtained from the 2011–2015 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. The sample for this study included all ED visits made by homeless and housed young adults aged 18–29 years (unweighted N = 25,068). Results: ED visits by homeless young adults were distinguished in terms of gender, region, payment sources, and triage level. Furthermore, ED visits made by homeless young adults were more likely related to mental health and suicide. Homeless young adults' ED visits were characterized by a longer average length of stay and were less likely to be referred to a physician or clinic for follow-up, given medication, or have a procedure performed in the ED. Conclusions: This study highlighted differences in ED utilization for homeless young adults. The findings of this study suggest a need to further examine the characteristics of ED services received by homeless young adults to better understand differences in ED service receipt related to housing status. This knowledge can inform efforts to reduce costs through improving access to housing and outpatient mental health care and reducing stigma among health care professionals to ensure continuity of care.

AB  - Homelessness poses risks to the health and safety of young adults; particularly among sexual and gender minority (SGM) young adults. The current study sought to better understand service use and perceived safety in community and service settings among SGM and cisgender heterosexual (cis‐hetero) young adults experiencing homelessness. Data come from a mixed‐method, ecological momentary assessment study (n = 80; 43% sexual minority; 10% gender minority) in Los Angeles, California. Participants reported their current location (service vs. nonservice setting) and perceived safety. Multilevel modeling examined associations between identity, location, and perceived safety; qualitative interviews with 20 SGM participants added context to quantitative findings. Overall, service location was associated with greater perceived safety (β = .27, p < .001). Compared to cis‐hetero participants, cisgender sexual minorities (β = −.23, p = .03) and sexual and gender minorities (β = −.50, p = .002) reported lower perceived safety in service settings (vs. nonservice settings). Qualitative interviews revealed themes and subthemes detailing safe/unsafe spaces and interpersonal conflict in the community, and relationships with staff, peers, transphobia, and positive experiences in service settings.

AB  - Background Youth experiencing homelessness are at high risk for suicide, yet few studies have evaluated risk reduction interventions targeting suicidal ideation in this vulnerable population. A comprehensive approach to risk-reduction is needed that addresses basic needs and provides targeted interventions for those at highest risk. The protocol described builds on the design of the first randomized trial of Housing First (HF) for homeless youth. The primary objective is to determine whether housing combined with supportive services that include suicide screening and targeted psychotherapy (Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention) is effective for reducing suicidal ideation and other secondary outcomes (depression and suicide attempts). Additionally, we will explore mediators of the treatment effect (housing stability and substance use) and determinants of implementation.Methods Youth recruited to the HF trial will be randomized to HF + supportive services (n = 120), or supportive services alone (n = 120). The “Suicide Treatment Education and Prevention” (STEP) protocol will additionally screen youth in both arms at baseline and 3 months for suicidal ideation (SSI-W). Those who screen as moderate risk for suicide (SSI-W ≥ 10) will be offered CTSP, which includes up to 9 sessions over the first 6 months following enrollment. CTSP will be delivered in one-on-one sessions by a trained advocate. Research assessments will be collected to assess outcomes (including suicidal ideation) at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Qualitative interviews with subjects receiving CTSP and other stakeholders will explore implementation determinants.Discussion The study will fill an important gap in the literature about the added benefit of HF combined with supportive services including suicide screening and treatment for reducing suicidal ideation in homeless youth. With the urgent need to address both homelessness and suicide risk, evidence is needed about services that can be integrated into delivery settings for youth experiencing homelessness.Trial registration NCT04135703.

AB  - Running away from foster care is fairly common, but there is no body of research that explores explicitly the question of whether Black and Hispanic youth run away from foster care at rates that are different from those for White youth. Using data from 17 states, I measured the probability of running away from foster care for Black, Hispanic, and White youth. This approach yields an unambiguous measure of disparity based on the odds ratio, a standard measure for summarizing group differences. In addition to individual differences in rates of running away (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity), I was also interested in knowing whether context matters. Context was measured at the county-level using urbanicity, social disadvantage, and a system-level measure of congregate care utilization. I also included whether the state where the county was located had policies that require an assessment of running-away risk. Older youth, girls, and youth with a history of placement in congregate care all have higher rates of running away. Further, Black and Hispanic youth are more likely to run away than White youth, but the magnitude of those differences depends on context. In particular, as measured, disparity in counties where I detected a tendency to use congregate care as a county-level attribute, disparity was greater. Among the implications, better reporting of running away by the federal government is highlighted. Regarding contextual effects and the dynamics of congregate utilization, the results point toward system effects as an important avenue for future research.

AB  - Researchers of homelessness have been careful to delineate the heterogeneity of adolescent homelessness and street involvement when defining and differentiating street life experiences around the globe. Understanding these experiences poses challenges to researchers as adolescents across these locations come to the street at various stages of transition and homelessness yet share similarities. In this article, we review homeless research to understand both the heterogeneous characteristics and experiences adolescents have when they become involved in street life and homelessness around the world, as well as the similarities and differences they globally share. We review and compare general definitions of street life and homelessness presented in observations of young people on the street in the developed and developing worlds. We then explore interrelated characteristics outlined by researchers across these studies and locations, namely, the homeless status of street life participants and their socialization to street life as well as their network affiliations. Although this collected body of work reveals a complex heterogeneity of street involvement among all those that participate, it also shows how the young and street involved around the globe share these commonalities with one another which challenges the frameworks and classifications that guide contemporary global research among the homeless.

AB  - Objective: Limited research exists on how employment interventions contribute to employment outcomes for homeless youth. This study examines the comparative efficacy of 2 interventions—Social Enterprise Intervention (SEI) and Individual Placement and Support (IPS)—provided to homeless youth with mental illness in a randomized controlled trial. Method: Participants were recruited from 1 homeless youth agency in Los Angeles, CA, and randomized to the SEI (n = 36) or IPS (n = 36) conditions. Over 20 months, SEI participants received 4 SEI components, and IPS participants received IPS services based on 8 principles. Data were collected at baseline and follow-up for the primary employment outcome (paid employment) and 5 secondary employment outcomes. Results: Over 20 months, 39% of SEI participants and 32% of IPS participants reported any paid employment. Across both groups, participants who reported working at baseline had nearly 8 times the odds of working at follow-up (OR = 7.91, p< 0.05). No statistically significant differences were detected across the full sample or between groups on the primary or secondary employment outcomes. Conclusions: Future effectiveness research is needed to compare the long-term employment outcomes of the SEI and IPS with a more heterogeneous sample of homeless youth using customized homelessness support services and more nuanced employment outcomes.

AB  - This study investigates the relative impact of trauma experiences that occurred prior to and since becoming homeless on depressive symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and self-injurious behaviors among a sample of homeless youth (N = 389). Youth (aged 13 to 25) who had been homeless or precariously housed in the past year completed a survey about housing history, experiences of violence and victimization, mental health, and service utilization. In addition to examining the impact associated with specific trauma types, we also considered the effect of "early-on" poly-victimization (i.e., cumulative number of reported traumas prior to homelessness) and the influence of a compound sexual trauma variable created to represent earlier complex trauma. This created-variable has values ranging from no reported trauma, single trauma, multiple non-sexual traumas, and multiple traumas that co-occurred with sexual abuse. Multivariate analyses revealed that specific traumatic experiences prior to homelessness, including sexual abuse, emotional abuse/neglect, and adverse home environment, predicted greater mental health symptoms. Poly-victimization did not add to the prediction of mental health symptoms after the inclusion of specific traumas. Results with early compound sexual trauma revealed significant differences between lower-order trauma exposures and multiple-trauma exposures. Specifically, experience of multiple traumas that co-occurred with sexual trauma was significantly more detrimental in predicting PTSD symptoms than multiple traumas of non-sexual nature. Findings support the utility of an alternate/novel conceptualization of complex trauma, and support the need to carefully evaluate complex traumatic experiences that occurred prior to homelessness, which can impact the design and implementation of mental health care and services for homeless youth.

AB  - Examines the social characteristics & motivations of young runaways in England, Scotland, & Wales. It is argued that the term "runaway" is often inappropriate in that it implies impulsiveness & irrational action; "refugee" may also be an inappropriate term as it implies that these youth need protection. Analysis of data on 24 youth entering a children's refuge in south Wales indicates that the reasons for entering the refuge & patterns of refuge use vary considerably by gender, race, & ethnicity. Males came to the project less often & worked on a more limited number of issues than did females. Minority youth were overrepresented in the refuge. Many youths had left nonparental residential care arrangements. It is concluded that new initiatives are needed for minority youth & youth in nonparental residential care. 4 Tables, 16 References. M.

AB  - Aims To test the acceptability and feasibility of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of mood and injection risk behavior among young people who inject drugs (PWID), using mobile phones. Methods Participants were 185 PWID age 18–35 recruited from two sites of a large syringe service program in Chicago. After completing a baseline interview, participants used a mobile phone app to respond to momentary surveys on mood, substance use, and injection risk behavior for 15 days. Participants were assigned to receive surveys 4, 5, or 6 times per day. Results Participants were 68% male, 61% non-Hispanic white, 24% Hispanic, and 5% non-Hispanic Black. Out of 185 participants, 8% (n = 15) failed to complete any EMA assessments. Among 170 EMA responders, the mean number of days reporting was 10 (SD 4.7), the mean proportion of assessments completed was 0.43 (SD 0.27), and 76% (n = 130) completed the follow-up interview. In analyses adjusted for age and race/ethnicity, women were more responsive than men to the EMA surveys in days reporting (IRR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.13–1.56), and total number of surveys completed (IRR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.18–1.93). Homeless participants responded on fewer days (IRR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.64–0.90) and completed fewer surveys (IRR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.54–0.91), and were less likely to return for follow-up (p = 0.016). EMA responsiveness was not significantly affected by the number of assigned daily assessments. Conclusions This study demonstrated high acceptability and feasibility of EMA among young PWID, with up to 6 survey prompts per day. However, homelessness significantly hampered successful participation.

Intervention topics included money management, food management, safe community participation, and room- and self-care. Life skill knowledge and readiness-to-change, measured using the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment, was examined at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-6 months later. Two scoring patterns emerged for readiness-to-change at each time point: Pre-Engaged and Engaged. Participants who were Engaged at the time of assessment scored significantly better than Pre-Engaged on post-intervention life skill testing, however group identification changed over time. Baseline readiness-to-change did not predict future performance or attrition, and therefore may not provide accurate indication of client investment for future learning or participation. Further investigation is needed to determine what factors contribute to Engaged membership.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The characteristics of homeless & runaway youth in Los Angeles County, Calif, are described drawing on data collected over 1 year from 10 shelter & outreach/drop-in agencies. These agencies are shown to serve different populations: while 48.4% of the shelter youth are age 15 or younger, 87.6% of outreach/drop-in youth are at least age 16. More than 50% of shelter youth are minorities, while outreach/drop-in youth are primarily white. The majority of shelter youth live within Los Angeles County, while 75+% of outreach/drop-in youth come from other areas. Abuse or neglect by primary caretaker is reported by 46.6% of shelter youth, but by only 20.8% of outreach/drop-in youth. Differences in referral sources & placement outcomes are also apparent. The philosophy, services, admission criteria, & goals of shelter & outreach/drop-in agencies are compared. 3 Tables, 7 References. D. Generoli

AB  - The high rates of substance use among American adolescents are challenging; however, runaway youth are at particularly high-risk for substance use. Runaway youth utilizing two service sectors, emergency crisis shelters & juvenile detention centers, were recruited to evaluate differences in risk factors associated with substance use. Findings demonstrate that youth admitted to juvenile detention (n = 121) had proportionally higher levels of problem behaviors, including substance use, than youth admitted to shelter services (n = 156). Both groups of youth have significantly higher levels of substance use than national estimates. The most significant risk factor for alcohol & marijuana use among youth in both groups was using other substances. Addressing issues of substance abuse among runaway youth must be a prime objective for future research & treatment for this high-risk population. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Adolescence is a critical developmental period in the lifespan, one of significant biological, neurological, psychological, social, emotional, and cognitive change. The transition from adolescence to adulthood is lengthy, gradual and increasingly complicated, particularly for youth with lived experience in foster care and others who have experienced significant adversity. This paper highlights a research-informed policy and practice framework for supporting healthy adolescent development; introduces a new youth self-assessment instrument that measures positive constructs of well-being; and provides recommendations for child welfare systems to better prepare young people to succeed and thrive as they transition to adulthood.

AB  - This article discusses the process & findings of a two-year study of homelessness in Georgetown, the heavily populated capital city on the northeast coast of Guyana in South America. From 1997 to 1999, 200 homeless individuals were interviewed in two waves, using a survey instrument including standardized measures & ethnographic interviewing. In Wave I, women fared far worse than their male counterparts on all mental health indicators. In Wave II, women, elders, & youths were therefore purposefully sampled. This report presents quantitative & qualitative data analysis on an unduplicated sample of 141 adults ages 20-89. Differences were found on several variables by gender & age cohort, with women under age 55 & all respondents ages 35-54 having the highest incidence of health & mental health problems. The study also represents effective global South-North social work collaboration. 4 Tables, 30 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Especially in the media, young homeless people are frequently presented as posing a violent threat to other members of the public. However, the economic circumstances, living situation and age of homeless youth are consistent with factors identified in victim research with vulnerability to violent crime. The present research explored the nature and extent of violent victimisation of homeless young people after they had left home. Intensive interviews were conducted with 51 homeless youth who were under the age of 18. Almost two-thirds of these young people had been physically assaulted and half had been sexually assaulted in the previous 12 months. The perpetrators of this violence were predominantly male. There were major differences in the nature of the violent experiences of the young men and the young women in terms of the relationship to the perpetrator, the location of the assault and the motivation. The demand for sex was a factor throughout the experiences of the young women.

Among White, African American, Hispanic, Native American, & Asian ethnic groups, youths who reported abuse or neglect by their parental figures or had parent(s) who were unemployed were less likely to reunify following a runaway episode. However, completing youth shelter services markedly increased the likelihood of reunification.

AB  - The current study identified subgroups of homeless youth and young adults that exhibited distinct co-occurring patterns of substance use and social stability (e.g., employment, school attendance, and housing), and evaluated the relative effectiveness of the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA), Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), and case management (CM) in interrupting substance use and improving social stability. The differentiating effects of personal characteristics on the co-occurrence of substance use and social stability were also examined. Participants included 270 homeless youth and young adults who were randomly assigned to one of the three intervention conditions: CRA, n = 93, MET, n = 86, or CM, n = 91. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months postbaseline. A dual trajectory latent class growth analysis identified four co-occurring patterns: low-stable substance use paired with low-increasing social stability, high-stable substance use paired with low-stable social stability, high-declining substance use paired with low-increasing social stability, and low-increasing substance use paired with high-stable social stability. Findings showed that CRA was superior in improving substance use and social stability simultaneously compared to MET and CM, and further, CM was more effective than MET. Personal factors including race, age, coping strategies, and behavior problems differentiated the co-occurring patterns of substance use and social stability. The findings underscore the significance in identifying subgroups of homeless youth that vary in problem severity in terms of their substance use and social stability, and offer evidence to help practitioners identify the most effective intervention that responds to the needs of homeless youth.

AB  - The Housing First (HF) approach for homeless adults with serious mental illness has gained support as an alternative to the mainstream "Treatment First" (TF) approach. In this study, group differences were assessed using qualitative data from 27 HF and 48 TF clients. Dichotomous variables for substance use and substance abuse treatment utilization were created and examined using bivariate and logistic regression analyses. The HF group had significantly lower rates of substance use and substance abuse treatment utilization; they were also significantly less likely to leave their program. Housing First's positive impact is contrasted with the difficulties Treatment First programs have in retaining clients and helping them avoid substance use and possible relapse.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

No meaningful differences were found in issues across the four groups; however, there were differences with regard to gender. Youth provided specific suggestions for HIV prevention programs, including communication strategies. Results will be used to facilitate the development & implementation of appropriate HIV prevention measures in eight SC counties. 3 Tables, 1 Figure, 16 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Purpose:This randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy between the Social Enterprise Intervention (SEI) and Individual Placement and Support (IPS) with homeless youth with mental illness to assess their impact on nonvocational outcomes.Method:Seventy-two homeless youth were recruited from one agency and randomized to the SEI (n = 36) or IPS (n = 36) conditions. Over 20 months, SEI participants received four SEI components, and IPS participants received eight IPS components. Data were collected on mental health, housing, and social support outcomes at baseline and one follow-up period.Results:Findings from mixed analysis of variance indicate that both SEI and IPS participants displayed statistically significant changes in their self-esteem, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) problems, inattention problems, living in a shelter, and living in a private residence.Conclusions:This is the first study to demonstrate the comparative efficacy and short-term nonvocational outcomes of SEI and IPS with homeless youth with mental illness. Assessment of long-term outcomes of both interventions is warranted.

AB  - Studies of digital disparities have focused on socio-spatial differences across neighbourhoods, regions and other kinds of places, but the same place can produce different experiences of connectivity, a phenomenon labelled ‘variable geometries of connection’ by Crang, Crosbie and Graham (2006: 2551) [2006. Crang, M., Crosbie, T., & Graham, S. Variable geometries of connection: Urban digital divides and the uses of information technology. Urban Studies, 43(13), 2551–2570]. In this paper, I draw on research on the role of mobile phones and the internet for people experiencing homelessess in Australia to suggest that dependence on smartphones for access to information and communication when homeless, in combination with the design and regulation of urban spaces, structures the mobilities of homeless young people, resulting in distinctive connectivity needs and barriers. Homeless young people overcome many of their immediate difficulties of digital access through practices of ‘survival infrastructuring’, a term I propose to describe the practices of marginalised actors to make their media work in the face of uneven, precarious and costly connectivity. Highlighting these connectivity experiences and practices may help efforts to take action on digital exclusion and assist homeless young people by taking into account differential access needs within specific spatial and social contexts. I make this argument drawing on findings from two studies carried out between 2014 and 2016 on the access and use of the internet and mobile phones among homeless Australians.

AB  - Objective: Many adolescents and young adults receiving substance use treatment have experienced or are at risk for homelessness. It is unknown whether specific treatment approaches are more or less effective for youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) compared to stably housed youth. The present study compared the effectiveness of the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach, Motivational Enhancement Therapy combined with Cognitive–Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT), and Treatment as Usual (TAU) for these two groups. Further subgroup differences were investigated by age, sex, and sexual and gender minority status. Method: YEH (n = 855) and a matched sample of stably housed youth (n = 855) were drawn from the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs, a nationwide substance use treatment data set. Multiple-group latent change score modeling was used to examine change in substance use frequency and related problems at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Results: Results indicated significant declines in substance use frequency and problems during treatment for all intervention groups. The TAU group showed the greatest declines in substance use problems during treatment and the greatest declines in frequency post-treatment. Compared to stably housed youth, YEH entered treatment with greater substance use and problems, and had greater declines in substance use in the MET/CBT group only. Other differences were found by age and sex. Conclusions: Overall, all three substance use interventions appear to be effective in reducing substance use and related problems. TAU and MET/CBT may be particularly effective for YEH in treatment settings. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

AB  - This Special Issue (SI) was conceived because of our interests in the social and economic determinants shaping what children and young people eat and the part food plays in their everyday lives. There is evidence that poverty and household food insecurity have increased in the global north in the wake of the Great Recession and that European families with children have been hardest hit (Chzhen, 2017; Davis and Geiger, 2017; Riches and Silvasti, 2014). Whilst food insecurity rates in the United States are declining towards their pre-recession levels, more than 42 million people experienced food insecurity in 2015 (Coleman-Jensen and others, 2016) and households with children are also more likely to be food insecure. Qualitative studies of children's perspectives of poverty show the damaging effects of material disadvantage and social exclusion, as well as the ways that resourceful and resilient young people manage the effects of poverty (Ridge, 2011) and subvert consumer cultures (Chin, 2001; Pugh, 2009). Despite some research on how food poverty is experienced by young people in the global South e.g. (Morrow and others, 2017) and USA e.g. (Connell and others, 2005; Fram and others, 1979), however, not enough is known about how children and young people negotiate food and eating in contexts of poverty and inequality or the difference that social contexts and social positioning make. We suggest the food practices of children in poor and low-income households deserve special attention because food is fundamental - not only to health but also social life - and provides an important lens for understanding lived experienced of material deprivation and social exclusion. Children's and young people's food consumption is manifested in their physical, emotion and mental health and, as papers in this SI also show, impacts on their ability to study and concentrate at school (Bundy and others, 2017). Commensality also plays an important role in establishing and cementing social networks, with food mediating children's attempts to connect to, and reject, social relations with others (James, 1979). Food is also integral to the reciprocal relationships of care in which children - and adults - are enmeshed (Clement, 1996; Cook, 2008). It is a medium for children's expression of identity and control and a means of enacting agency and increasing their autonomy as they grow older (O'Connell and Brannen, 2016). Exclusion from the routine food practices that are part of children's and young people's 'ordinary living patterns' (Townsend, 1979, p. 31) may therefore be regarded as a dimension of relative poverty (O'Connell and others, 2018). By focussing on children's and young people's food and eating, the SI makes a contribution to understanding how poverty and inequality are negotiated in children's everyday practices whilst not neglecting the importance  of geographical and neighbourhood context, be that at a local, regional or national level across the UK, Eastern Europe and North America.

AB  - Human trafficking is a public health issue affecting homeless young adults across the United States; however, screening tools for trafficking specifically for this population are lengthy and onerous. The aim of this study was to develop a sensitive, brief, and user-friendly trafficking screening tool for homeless young adults. Five candidate items for the screening tool were identified from the Vera Institute's Trafficking Victim Identification Tool (TVIT). Study participants were asked the five candidate items, and then received a trafficking assessment using the Human Trafficking Identification and Measurement (HTIAM-14), which is validated for the homeless youth population. A multivariable logistic model was used to analyze the five candidate items in relation to a trafficking experience on the longer HTIAM-14. Homeless people, aged 18 to 22 years old, receiving support from Covenant House New Jersey were eligible to participate in the study. Over 15 months in 2015–2017, 340 trafficking assessments were performed for 307 participants; 8.8% (30) of the assessments revealed a human trafficking experience. Of assessments identifying a trafficking experience, 66.7% (20) found sex trafficking and 46.7% (14) labor trafficking, with 16.7% (5) demonstrating both forms of trafficking. We validated a new screening tool, Quick Youth Indicators for Trafficking (QYIT). QYIT allows providers to screen for trafficking among homeless young adults; an affirmative answer to at least one QYIT question is 86.7% sensitive and 76.5% specific in identifying a trafficking experience. QYIT is the first highly sensitive, comprehensive trafficking screening tool that is truly brief and does not require a trafficking expert to administer. Use of QYIT at appropriate agencies will enable social service providers to systematically detect and serve homeless young adults who have labor and/or sex trafficking experiences.

AB  - Purpose Homeless youth are at particularly high risk for teen pregnancy; research indicates as many as 20% of homeless young women become pregnant. These pregnant and homeless teens lack financial resources and adequate health care, resulting in increased risk for low-birth-weight babies and high infant mortality. This study investigated individual and family-level predictors of teen pregnancy among a national sample of runaway/homeless youth in order to better understand the needs of this vulnerable population. Methods Data from the Runaway/Homeless Youth Management Information System (RHY MIS) provided a national sample of youth seeking services at crisis shelters. A sub-sample of pregnant females and a random sub-sample (matched by age) of nonpregnant females comprised the study sample (N = 951). Chi-square and t tests identified differences between pregnant and nonpregnant runaway females; maximum likelihood logistic regression identified individual and family-level predictors of teen pregnancy. Results Teen pregnancy was associated with being an ethnic minority, dropping out of school, being away from home for longer periods of time, having a sexually transmitted disease, and feeling abandoned by one's family. Family factors, such as living in a single parent household and experiencing emotional abuse by one's mother, increased the odds of a teen being pregnant. Conclusions The complex problems associated with pregnant runaway/homeless teens create challenges for short-term shelter services. Suggestions are made for extending shelter services to include referrals and coordination with teen parenting programs and other systems of care.

AB  - AimsResidential instability, including transience (i.e. unusually frequent mobility), is associated with higher risk for emotional and behavioural problems in children and young adults. However, most studies have not compared the effect of recent v. more distal moves on mental health or on mental health treatment. This study examined associations between recent (past year) and distal (past 2–4 years) residential transience and past year major depressive episode (MDE) and mental health treatment in a nationally representative sample of US adolescents aged 12–17.MethodsData are from the 2010–2014 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (n = ~107 300 adolescents). T-tests were used to examine the prevalence of MDE by number of moves in the past 5 years among a nationally representative sample of adolescents. Additionally, multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the adjusted association between recent (⩾2 moves in the past year) and distal (⩾4 moves in the past 5 years, but no recent transience) and (1) past year MDE and (2) past year mental health treatment among adolescents with MDE.ResultsMDE prevalence increased linearly with number of moves in the past 5 years (p< 0.001). The adjusted odds of MDE were greater among youths with distal transience (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.09–1.44) and among those with proximal transience (AOR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.17–1.46), compared with those without transience in the past 5 years. The MDE prevalence did not differ between those with distal and proximal transience (p = 0.163). In youths with past year MDE, the prevalence of past year mental health treatment was greater among those with proximal transience compared with those without transience (AOR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.15–1.70), but there was no significant difference in treatment among those with distal v. no transience.ConclusionsDistal and recent transience are associated with past year MDE among adolescents. Adolescents with MDE who had recent transience were more likely to receive past year mental health treatment compared with those without transience. However, those with only distal transience were not more likely to receive treatment. Parents, school officials and health care providers should be aware that residential mobility in the past 5 years may indicate increased odds of depression among adolescents even among adolescents whose housing stability has improved in the past year.

AB  - Runaway youths represent a neglected clinical group, & few studies have examined ethnicity differences within this population. Substance use, family functioning, & related problem behaviors were examined in a sample of Hispanic & Anglo runaway youths with substance abuse diagnoses (N = 145). Youths, aged 12-17, were recruited from two urban, southwestern runaway shelters. Within single-parent families, Anglo youths reported more marijuana use, &, regardless of family constitution, reported more tobacco use than did Hispanic youths. Overall, Anglo youths reported more externalizing problems & more conflict tactics used in resolving disagreements with their primary caretaker while Hispanic youths reported higher depression & familism scores. Given the differences found between Hispanic & Anglo youths, the findings argue that culturally sensitive interventions for runaway youths & families are warranted. 4 Tables, 64 References.

AB  - Using secondary analyses of data from a sample of 265 sexual minority youths, the authors examined correlates of cutting behavior to determine whether patterns are similar to those found in studies of self-injury with community samples of predominately heterosexual youths. The sample consisted of youths who received services at an urban social service agency serving the sexual minority community; youths from the region attending social events, who located the survey through the Internet, or who were referred from other youth-serving agencies; and youths from out of state who found the survey through the Internet or were referred by youth-serving agencies. Prevalence of cutting was higher than that found in community-based samples of similar age groups. However, similar patterns of risk were found with regard to peer victimization, homelessness, suicidality, and depression. Female and transgender respondents were more likely to have engaged in cutting behavior than were male respondents. No significant race-based differences emerged. Both age and having knowledge of a supportive adult were associated with decreased likelihood of cutting. Additional findings link higher levels of "outness," higher occurrence of suicidality among social network, and higher rates of smoking to increased likelihood of cutting. Implications for practice and future research are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The characteristics of homeless & runaway youth in Los Angeles County, Calif, are described drawing on data collected over 1 year from 10 shelter & outreach/drop-in agencies. These agencies are shown to serve different populations: while 48.4% of the shelter youth are age 15 or younger, 87.6% of outreach/drop-in youth are at least age 16. More than 50% of shelter youth are minorities, while outreach/drop-in youth are primarily white. The majority of shelter youth live within Los Angeles County, while 75+% of outreach/drop-in youth come from other areas. Abuse or neglect by primary caretaker is reported by 46.6% of shelter youth, but by only 20.8% of outreach/drop-in youth. Differences in referral sources & placement outcomes are also apparent. The philosophy, services, admission criteria, & goals of shelter & outreach/drop-in agencies are compared. 3 Tables, 7 References. D. Generoli

AB  - Background Studies indicate high rates of substance use among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH). Further, the social networks of YEH, although multi-dimensional in composition, are largely comprised of other YEH, substance users, and individuals who do not provide the youth with tangible or emotional support. For YEH who have the opportunity to enter a housing program, helping them to reduce their substance use and strengthen their prosocial supportive connections during this critical transition period may increase their stability and reduce their risk of re-entering homelessness. The goal of this study is to pilot test a brief motivational network intervention (MNI), delivered by case managers, to help former YEH who have recently transitioned to a housing program reduce their substance use and strengthen their prosocial supportive connections.Methods/design Up to 60 residents of housing programs in the Los Angeles area will be randomized to receive four sessions of usual case manager support or four sessions of case manager support + MNI. Each MNI session consists of three parts: (1) identifying two goals that are most important for the resident over the next year (e.g., get or keep a job, finish or stay in school, reduce substance use); (2) a network interview with the resident to capture network data pertaining to their interactions in the past 2 weeks; and (3) a discussion between the case manager and the resident of the resulting network visualizations, conducted in a Motivational Interviewing (MI) style, and what role the resident’s network may play in reaching their most important goals over the next year.Discussion This study addresses a critical gap by pilot testing a computer-assisted MNI, delivered using MI techniques, that can help case managers work with recent YEH to reduce substance use and increase permanent supportive connections during the critical transitional period from homelessness to housing.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04637815.

AB  - The study reported in this article assessed prevalence and demographic correlates of sex trafficking in a purposive sample of 270 young people experiencing homelessness in three U.S. cities (Philadelphia; Phoenix; and Washington, DC) and at five host agencies. Participants were 57% male, 38% female, 4% transgender, and 1% other. The average age of participants was 20.7 years (SD = 2.0 years). The majority of the participants were African American (56%), followed by white (14%) and multiracial (14%). The Human Trafficking Interview and Assessment Measure detected that nearly one in five young people were victims of sex trafficking, either due to force, fraud, or coercion (FFC); age; or both. Those who were sex trafficked were more likely than those who were not sex trafficked to be female, sexual minorities, or Latino and to have either dropped out of high school or obtained a GED. Differences between being trafficked due to FFC and being trafficked due to age were also investigated. Findings support the need for development of targeted prevention and intervention efforts for young people experiencing homelessness that address sex trafficking victimization and related risk factors.

AB  - Research suggests that poverty is a key driver of intimate partner violence (IPV), however detailed analysis suggests that this relationship is not clear, either for women’s experience or men’s perpetration of IPV. We explored associations between poverty and IPV using cross-sectional data from the Stepping Stones and Creating Futures cluster randomized control trial, in urban informal settlements in Durban, South Africa, with young (18–30) people. Using logistic regression and structural equation modelling we assess associations between poverty and women’s experience and men’s perpetration of physical and/or sexual IPV in the past 12 months. 680 women and 677 men were recruited into the study between September 2015 and September 2016. The analyses highlight how specific forms or measures of poverty intersecting with gender identities shape IPV. For men we found indicators of economic provision were associated with IPV perpetration, while for women food-insecurity was key to IPV experience. We also found similarities between women and men. First, food-insecurity and childhood traumas shaped pathways to substance misuse and poor mental health that increased IPV. Second, there was a resilience pathway in both models, whereby those with more education had increased gender equitable attitudes and fewer controlling behaviours, which reduced IPV. Interventions to reduce IPV need to work to reduce household food insecurity, but these need to be combined with gender transformative interventions. Interventions should also focus on reducing the impact of mental health and substance misuse. Finally, working to increase educational attainment is a long-term critical intervention to reduce IPV.Trial registration: NCT03022370. Registered 13 January 2017, retrospectively registered.

AB  - The present study examines differences between homeless adolescents, young adults, and older adults served by homeless shelters or food programs to inform service provision. Four homeless studies using the same sampling and measurement methods were pooled to permit comparisons across age groups. Results showed that homeless adolescents demonstrated greater resilience than younger and older adults. Adolescents reported the shortest duration of homelessness, lowest number of life stressors, fewest physical symptoms, largest social networks, and fewest clinically significant mental health problems. Adolescents also received fewer alcohol and drug abuse diagnoses than younger and older adults. Younger adults reported less time homeless and fewer physical symptoms than older adults, but more life stressors. Younger adults also endorsed higher levels of hostile and paranoid psychological symptoms. Implications for service provision and policy are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Background There is concern that cannabis use negatively affects vulnerable groups such as youth; however, the relationship between cannabis use and health care utilization has not been well characterized in this population. We longitudinally evaluated the association between daily cannabis use and hospitalization among a prospective cohort of street-involved youth.Methods Data were collected from the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS) in Vancouver, Canada, from September 2005 to May 2015. Participants were interviewed semi-annually and multivariable generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between daily cannabis use and hospitalization.Results A total of 1216 participants (31.2% female) were included in this analysis, and 373 (30.7%) individuals reported hospitalization at some point during the study period. In a multivariable GEE analysis, daily cannabis use was not significantly associated with hospitalization (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.17, 95% Confidence interval [CI] = 0.84, 1.65). We did observe a significant interaction between daily cannabis use and sex (AOR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.34, 0.77), whereby cannabis use was associated with a decreased odds of hospitalization among males (AOR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.47, 0.78), yet was not significantly associated with hospitalization among females (AOR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.84, 1.67).Conclusions The finding that daily cannabis use was not associated with hospitalization among street-involved youth is encouraging given the high rates of cannabis use in this population and the expansion of cannabis legalization and regulation. Future studies, however, are warranted to monitor possible changes in the consequences of cannabis use as cannabis legalization and regulation increase internationally.

AB  - Homeless young adults exhibit high rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and sexual risk behaviors. This study is a secondary analysis of data collected in a randomized clinical trial of AWARE, a new 4 session group motivational interviewing intervention. AWARE mainly focused on alcohol use and sexual risk behavior given focus group feedback. We used sequential coding to analyze how the group process affected both AOD use and sexual risk behavior at 3-month follow up among homeless young adults by examining facilitator behavior and participant change talk (CT) and sustain talk (ST). We analyzed 57 group session digital recordings of 100 youth (69% male, 74% heterosexual, 28% non-Hispanic white, 23% African American, 26% Hispanic, 23% multiracial/other; mean age 21.75). Outcomes included importance and readiness to change AOD use and risky sexual behavior, AOD use and consequences, number of partners and unprotected sex, and condom self-efficacy. Sequential analysis indicated that facilitator open-ended questions and reflections of CT increased Group CT. Group CT was associated with a lower likelihood of being a heavy drinker 3 months later; Group ST was associated with decreased readiness and confidence to change alcohol use. There were no associations with CT or ST for drug use or risky sexual behavior. Facilitator speech and peer responses were related to CT and ST during the group sessions with this high risk population, which were then associated with individual changes for alcohol use. Further research is needed to explore associations with drug use and sexual risk behavior.

AB  - The YP4 study was a clinical controlled trial (CCT) of joined up services for young people experiencing both homelessness and unemployment in Victoria, Australia. The joined up service delivery (J group, n = 222) participants were offered intensive client-centred case management, involving direct provision of a range of services as well as the brokering of additional services. The standard services (S group, n = 174) participants remained eligible for standard services. Access to the Australian Government income support agency's (Centrelink) administrative data provided a retention rate close to 90% over the three annual data collection points of the study (baseline, 12 months and 24 months). Both groups improved their circumstances over the two years of the trial. The results showed no statistically significant treatment effects. The effect for employment earnings was approaching significance (p = .06) with J group increasing their employment earnings to a greater extent than S group. The findings and their implications for the implementation of joined up case management, future policy and practice, and future homelessness research is discussed. Adapted from the source document.

A survey of 200+ agencies in four London boroughs & seven other British cities found that the majority of homeless young people (ages 16-25) in five of the cities & parts of London are women, a fact obscured by statistics that distinguish between single & family homelessness & by research based on counts of street sleepers. Young homeless women are often partnered or separated & are more likely than their male counterparts to sleep in hostels or the homes of friends & relatives. It is also noted that the homeless population is less white & more black than apparent in Rough Sleepers Initiative programs. 6 Tables, 1 Figure, 41 References. E. Blackwell

AB  - This study explored the gender differences in sexual self-concept, personal resources for sexual health, safe sex behaviors, and risky sexual behaviors among homeless adolescents with and without histories of sexual abuse. Data for this secondary analysis were collected in 2003 to 2004 in the first phase of a larger repeated-measures sexual health intervention study; 371 homeless youth between 16 and 23 years of age (M = 19.26, SD = 1.83) were recruited from a street outreach center. The majority (64.6%) of participants were males. Self-report instruments were completed at the outreach center via audio computer-assisted self-interview (A-CASI) format. It was found that female participants were better off than males on numerous measures of sexual health behaviors and attitudes. Sexually abused participants had significantly less future time perspective (p = .05), fewer sexual self-care behaviors (p = .04), and less social support than nonabused participants (p = .01) and almost significantly more sexual risk-taking (p = .08). However, no significant differences were found between abused and nonabused participants on sexual self-concept, self-efficacy or intention to use condoms, safe sex behaviors, AIDS knowledge, assertive communication, or self-efficacy to perform testicular/ breast self-exams. Overall, participants who did not report a history of sexual abuse had significantly more sexual health resources and engaged in fewer sex-risk behaviors than those who reported having been abused. These differences have notable implications for screening adolescents for a history of sexual abuse. Adolescents who report sexual abuse should receive risk counseling and be screened regularly for the development of sexual risk behaviors. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT].

AB  - Many transgender (trans) young adults migrate to urban enclaves with known infrastructures to fulfil gender affirmation needs such as obtaining trans-inclusive healthcare and support. This study sought to explore experiences of intranational migration (i.e. migration within a single country) for gender affirmation among trans young adults who relocated to San Francisco. A convenience sample of 61 trans young adults aged 18 to 29 (32% nonbinary, 28% trans women, and 40% trans men; 84% identified as a person of colour) participated in a one-time qualitative interview as part of a larger study. Thematic analysis was used to develop and refine the codes and themes. Three overarching themes became apparent regarding intranational migration and gender affirmation needs: (1) access to basic gender affirmation needs; (2) safety; and (3) the price of gender affirmation. Migration for gender affirmation and safety placed informants at risk for structural vulnerabilities including homelessness, unemployment and racism. Despite these structural vulnerabilities, participants were willing to “pay” the price in order to gain gender affirmation and safety. Findings underscore the importance of moving beyond individual-level risk factors to understand how unmet gender affirmation needs may place trans young adults in structurally vulnerable positions that can affect health and wellness.

AB  - The relationship between homelessness and ill health is complex, and many risk factors for homelessness such as unemployment, low income, and substance abuse are also risk factors for poor oral health. In order to overcome barriers to access dental care, previous studies have recommended integrating dental care, referral pathways, and information within the overall care provided by support services available to people at risk of homelessness. This study aimed to evaluate a dental service developed and implemented to improve access to oral health care of disadvantaged youth in Brisbane. A mobile dental clinic run by volunteer dental professionals was implemented into a community organisation for disadvantaged youth. Participants were clients of Brisbane Youth Services who were disadvantaged youth, ≤25 years and attended the dental clinic in a 1 year period. A questionnaire collected demographic information, a self‐assessment of oral health and an evaluation of their experiences with the dental clinic. Clinical data including DMFT, appointment attendance and items of service provided were collected. One hundred and twelve clients participated in the four dental clinic weeks and its evaluation. Cost was the greatest reported barrier to accessing dental care among participants. More than half (57%) of participants who pre‐booked an appointment failed to attend. A total of 640 services were delivered, with an estimated value of $48,000. The majority (69%, n = 444) of the services provided were preventative services. Almost all of the clients felt the service they received was suitable for them (97%, n = 98) and would use the service again (98%, n = 99). This dental clinic model is feasible and sustainable due to its integration into an existing homeless youth service, low running costs, acceptability to clients and an interest by dental practitioners to volunteer. It provides a useful model which could be scaled up and implemented in other regions.

AB  - Baseline data were collected to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions on completion of the hepatitis A and B vaccine series among 664 sheltered and street-based homeless adults who were: (a) homeless; (b) recently (<1 year) discharged from prison; (c) discharged 1 year or more; and (d) never incarcerated. Group differences at baseline were assessed for socio-demographic characteristics, drug and alcohol use, sexual activity, mental health and public assistance. More than one-third of homeless persons (38%) reported prison time and 16% of the sample had been recently discharged from prison. Almost half of persons who were discharged from prison at least 1 year ago reported daily use of drugs and alcohol over the past 6 months compared to about 1 in 5 among those who were recently released from prison. As risk for HCV and HIV co-infection continues among homeless ex-offenders, HIV/HCV prevention efforts are needed for this population. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - We recruited a sample of individuals who were formerly homeless that received assertive community treatment (ACT) services to assess differences in their sources and perceived quality of social support related to changes in their residence status. Standardized questionnaires were administered to 22 participants via face-to-face interviews, including various measures of social support and relationship quality. Results indicated that participants mentioned ACT staff members significantly more often than any other relationship category (e.g., friends or family) as sources of social support. Participants also indicated that the quality of their relationships with ACT staff members was significantly better than relationships maintained before and during their homelessness. These findings indicate that ACT staff can serve as social supports for clients on their caseloads, and they further suggest that clients perceive these worker-consumer relationships to be of high quality. Implications related to community integration are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This qualitative evaluation of the Social Enterprise Intervention (SEI), a vocational training program for homeless young adults, used summative focus-group data to understand clients' perceptions of outcomes as a result of SEI participation. Data from formative focus-group discussions were also used to assess the intervention process and make necessary changes during the program. Over four months, two process- and one outcomes-oriented focus-group discussions were conducted with street-living young adults in the SEI Program. Open-ended questions were used to explore perceptions of project implementation and client outcomes. Emergent outcomes-related themes include family respect, self-esteem, goal-orientation, labor and social networks, delinquent behavior and societal perceptions of homeless youth. Grounded theory is used to interpret findings and develop working hypotheses to guide future studies of vocational interventions for street-living youth.

AB  - (1) Background: While the prevalence of tobacco smoking in the general population has declined, it remains exceptionally high for smokers with severe mental illness (SMI), despite significant public health measures. This project aims to adapt, pilot test and evaluate a novel e-health smoking cessation intervention to assist relapse prevention and encourage sustained smoking cessation for young adults (aged 18-29 years) with SMI. (2) Methods: Using co-design principles, the researchers will adapt the Kick.it smartphone App in collaboration with a small sample of current and ex-smokers with SMI. In-depth interviews with smokers with SMI who have attempted to quit in the past 12 months and ex-smokers (i.e., those having not smoked in the past seven days) will explore their perceptions of smoking cessation support options that have been of value to them. Focus group participants will then give their feedback on the existing Kick.it App and any adaptations needed. The adapted App will then be pilot-tested with a small sample of young adult smokers with SMI interested in attempting to cut down or quit smoking, measuring utility, feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes in supporting their quit efforts. (3) Conclusions: This pilot work will inform a larger definitive trial. Dependent on recruitment success, the project may extend to also include smokers with SMI who are aged 30 years or more.

AB  - Rates of shelter use among young adults (ages 18–24) experiencing homelessness are disproportionally low, compared to youth or older adults experiencing homelessness. The high unsheltered rate exposes these young adults to significant short- and long-term risks, while shelter use is associated with positive and improved outcomes, including increased access to other supportive services. Few studies have focused on factors related to low rates of shelter use among young adults or on the relative importance of such factors. The present study examines a series of background and contextual factors that are associated with shelter use among young adults experiencing homelessness. Using survey data (n = 338) collected in Houston, Texas, this study employs multiple logistic regression to examine correlates of shelter use and to assess the relative importance of each factor. Results indicate several significant characteristics were positively associated with shelter use, including being female, being non-white, using other types of services, and Internet use. We highlight research, practice, and policy implications around understanding differences in shelter and drop-in center use and ensuring young adults can find and access shelters with services geared toward their age group.

AB  - This article presents a non-experimental, exploratory study of the experiences of unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness in Washington, DC. Using a community-based participatory action approach, researchers conducted open-ended survey interviews with 57 participants, all of whom identified as persons of color. Findings offer insight on where youth stay most evenings, what precipitated youths’ most recent experience of homelessness, strategies used to cope or survive on the streets, primary service needs, and advice from youth experiencing homelessness. The youth’s family experiences were an important factor in their experiences of homelessness. Implications for social work practice, policy, and research are discussed.

AB  - Young people transitioning from out-of-home care, commonly called care leavers, are known to be a vulnerable group. Many experience poor outcomes leading them to become homeless or involved in the criminal justice system. Yet compared to most other Anglophone democracies, Australia lacks mandatory assistance for care leavers beyond 18 years of age. There are also major legislative, policy, and program differences between care leaver entitlements in the individual states and territories. This paper argues that the Commonwealth Government should introduce a nationally consistent extended care system that would require all jurisdictions to provide a minimum standard of support until at least 21 years of age. A uniform set of extended care standards is even more vital in the context of COVID-19.IMPLICATIONSMany Australian care leavers have poor life chances despite recent advances in the support programs provided by the states and territories.A nationally consistent extended care program is likely to progress improved opportunities and outcomes for care leavers.

AB  - Providing stable housing for runaway & homeless youth is a major function of a transitional living program. This article introduces the focus of one program working with LGBTQ youth in New York City & discusses some issues to consider when working with this population. The article also presents data associated with young people's lives after discharge. In any discussion of outcomes, both reason for discharge & length of stay play important roles in whether or not an exit is safe. Regardless of these two elements, the places youth move to when leaving programs are crucial to their safety & well-being. The exit can be safe even when a young person is discharged early from a program. This article presents types of exits, as well as status of employment & school enrollment at exit. Some youth & staff-identified lessons gained in the program also are discussed in detail. Types of aftercare services sought by discharged youth are specified. This article also describes any differences in outcomes for youth with & without foster care experience.

AB  - Background: Although the prevalence of cigarette smoking in the United States has decreased, rates remain elevated among sexual and gender minorities (SGMs). This study examined rates and correlates of tobacco use among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and transgender women. Methods: Participants (N = 771) were drawn from the baseline assessment of an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of racially diverse MSM aged 16-29 years. Data collection took place in 2015-2016. Socio-demographic and SGM-specific (e.g., gender identity, sexual identity, physical attraction) correlates of cigarette smoking and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use were identified using logistic regression. Results: Twenty-one percent were current cigarette smokers. Nearly 40% ever tried an e-cigarette, but regular e-cigarette use was low (3.8%). Smokers were more likely to be older (vs. aged 16-18), less educated, homeless, bisexual or identify as some other sexual minority (vs. gay), attracted to males and females equally or more attracted to females than males (vs. males only), and HIV-positive. E-cigarette users were more likely to be transgender women (vs. cisgender men), White (vs. Black), more educated, and mostly attracted to females. Conclusions: Findings highlight important risk factors for tobacco use among SGM youth. Correlates of smoking mirrored findings observed in the general population, but also included factors specific to SGM youth (e.g., sexual orientation, HIV status, homelessness). Although some variables (gender identity, attraction) demonstrated similar relationships with smoking and e-cigarette use, others (race/ethnicity, education) demonstrated opposite patterns. Findings underscore the urgent need for tobacco prevention and cessation interventions for SGM youth.

AB  - Using a sample of 1,625 homeless youth and young adults aged 10 to 25 from 28 different states in the United States, this study examines the correlates of having engaged in survival sex. Findings suggest that differences exist based on demographic variables (gender, age, race, and sexual orientation), lifetime drug use (inhalants, Valium^DTM, crack cocaine, alcohol, Coricidin^DTM, and morphine), recent drug use (alcohol, ecstasy, heroin, and methamphetamine), mental health variables (suicide attempts, familial history of substance use, and having been in substance abuse treatment), and health variables (sharing needles and having been tested for HIV). In addition to replicating previous findings, this study's findings suggest that African American youth; gay, lesbian, or bisexual youth; and youth who had been tested for HIV were significantly more likely to have engaged in survival sex than White, heterosexual youth, and youth who had not been tested for HIV, respectively. Implications for interventions with youth and suggestions for future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Every year 4.2 million young people in America experience some form of homelessness. The observation that homelessness has a complex etiology spanning structural, relational, and individual levels of influence is not novel. However, few studies have empirically demonstrated how conditions across these levels collectively shape a distinct social ecology of homelessness, particularly for youth. Using critical realism and the extended case method, we analyze in-depth interviews with 215 young people. Our findings suggest a social ecology of displacement prior to and during homelessness. Findings complement ecological perspectives on homelessness among youth but support a more dynamic, interdependent, and bidirectional theorizing of its causes and consequences. We propose a conceptual model illustrating these processes and call for critical placemaking as a much-needed, relationally just praxis with young people.

AB  - Background: Prior research reveals high unemployment rates among homeless young adults. The literature offers many examples of using evidence-based supported employment models with vulnerable populations to assist them in obtaining and maintaining competitive employment; yet few examples exist to date with homeless young adults with mental illness. Objective: The purpose of this study was thus to adapt an evidence-based intervention for adults with psychiatric illnesses [i.e., the Individual Placement and Support (IPS)] with homeless young adults with mental illness. Methods: Convenience sampling was used to recruit 20 homeless young adults (ages 18-24) with mental illness from the host agency. Participants received the IPS intervention over 10 months. A comparison sample was used at a separate agency of 16 homeless young adults with mental illness, who received standard agency services. Using a pre-post, self-comparison quasi-experimental design, the impact of the IPS was assessed on five employment outcomes: (1) ever-worked rate, (2) working-at-follow-up rate, (3) monthly work rate, (4) weekly work hours and (5) weekly income. Results: The IPS group was significantly more likely to have worked at some point over the 10-month study as well as to have worked a greater number of months overall. Conclusions: Findings provide greater insight into adapting, implementing and evaluating the IPS model with homeless young adults with mental illness. The study demonstrates that the IPS model is adaptable to work with homeless young adults with mental illness and is associated with successful retention and employment outcomes.

AB  - Runaway and homeless youth (RHY) are served by specialized settings (e.g., Drop-In Centers, Transitional Living Programs, and multi-program settings), but little is known about the characteristics of these organizations or their effects on RHY's behavioral and psychosocial outcomes. To address this gap we studied 29 randomly selected diverse settings across New York State, including those in rural, suburban, and urban areas. Within settings, we used the Youth Program Quality Assessment model to observe and rate programs for RHY (N = 53), assess program administrators (N=30), and conduct anonymous structured assessment batteries with RHY aged 16-21 years (N =463). We found settings overall evidenced satisfactory-to-high quality on a multi-perspective setting quality score. With respect to RHY's behavioral outcomes, engagement in school/job training/work was high (81%), substance use was moderate (mean use: 17 of the past 90 days), and 37% evidenced involvement in the street economy (e.g., drug dealing, burglary). RHY in Transitional Living Programs and multi-program settings had more engagement in school/job training/work and less involvement in the street economy than their peers in Drop-In Centers. The quality of settings was not associated with these three behavioral outcomes (school/training/work, substance use, street economy), likely due to issues of restricted range. However, higher setting quality was associated with four constructive psychosocial outcomes; namely, RHY's perceptions that settings foster positive outcomes in these three domains, and perceived resilience. Thus the present study highlights settings overall good quality, with some variability, and provides guidance on strategies to assess setting quality. Consistent with the existing literature, RHY in Drop-In Centers are highly vulnerable and may require additional types of services/programs to achieve their potential. Further, while the present study suggests all settings benefit RHY, better quality settings may be able to move beyond meeting RHY's basic requirements and address higher order relational, psychosocial, and motivational needs. Importantly, fostering a sense of resilience among RHY, as well as young people's experiences of settings as helpful to them in achieving good behavioral outcomes, may have long-term beneficial effects on RHY's engagement in other settings, relationships, adaptation, and functioning.

Method: Three hundred & twenty-eight homeless & runaway youth were interviewed using a systematic sampling strategy in metropolitan Seattle. Homeless young people were interviewed on the streets & in shelters by outreach workers in youth service agencies. Results: The current study revealed widespread prevalence of dissociative symptoms among these young people. Multivariate analyses revealed that sexual abuse, physical abuse, & family mental health problems were all positively associated with dissociative symptoms. No gender differences were found for any of the models. Conclusions: Dissociative behavior is widespread among these youth & may pose a serious mental health concern. Some young people experience numerous stressors, & with few resources & little support available, many may invoke maladaptive strategies such as dissociative behavior to handle such situations, which may in turn be detrimental to their mental health. Unless youth are provided with programs & intervention, the cycle of abuse that they have experienced at home is likely to continue on the street. 3 Tables, 1 Appendix, 39 References.

AB  - This is an exploratory study of 91 runaway/homeless youths' nutritional intake. Specifically, this study examines the influences of these youth's psychosocial characteristics on nutritional intake. Findings show that these youth's diets are high in fat/sugar, tend to be fried, and easy to access/consume while on the run. Homeless and throwaway youth were found to have the worst nutritional intake patterns of all the youth in the sample. Youth between ages twelve and fifteen consumed more sucrose daily, but had better vitamin, calcium and iron consumption than did youth between ages sixteen and eighteen. Youth whose parents received public assistance, disability insurance and social security had better iron and calcium intake than youth whose parents had salaried income. Youth that experienced more psychological issues consumed the least calories daily and consumed the least calories from sucrose daily. Experiencing physical abuse by one's mother, part of a three variable model, was found to predict higher levels, of sucrose intake daily. Also, experiencing neglect by one's father, part of a four variable model, was found to predict more caloric intake daily. Youth shelter-based social workers and health care-based social workers need to assess these youth's food choices and access to food while living on the streets and intervene as part of multidisciplinary teams. In that way, they may be instrumental in the development of community networks that provide food and assistance to runaway and homeless youth while on the run.

Unless youth are provided with programs and intervention, the cycle of abuse that they have experienced at home is likely to continue on the street.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Data were derived from the At-Risk Youth Study, a Vancouver-based prospective cohort of street-involved youth aged 14-26. We used generalized estimating equations to examine variables associated with high-intensity drug use, defined as daily use of crack cocaine, cocaine, heroin, or crystal methamphetamine. From September 2005 to November 2012, of 1017 youth included in the analyses, 529 (52%) reported high-intensity drug use as defined above at least once during the study period. In a multivariate analysis, older age (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.47); residing in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver (AOR = 1.46); homelessness (AOR = 1.30); recent incarceration (AOR = 1.25); inability to access addiction treatment (AOR = 1.42); and crack pipe sharing and/or used syringe injecting (AOR = 2.64), were all positively and independently associated with high-intensity drug use (p < 0.05). The most common barrier to accessing addiction treatment reported by these youth was long waiting lists. High-intensity drug use among street-involved youth was prevalent and associated with structural and geographical disadvantages in addition to high-risk drug administration practices. Youth reporting more frequent drug use also reported barriers to accessing addiction treatment, highlighting the need to expand addiction services tailored to youth at greatest risk of harm from illicit drug use and street-involvement.

AB  - This article reports on results of a one-day public health survey conducted in six states by homeless youth providers to measure and compare risk factors between lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) homeless youth and non-LGB homeless youth. This article intends to inform the child welfare field on existing gaps in services and areas where more training and technical support is necessary in providing services to homeless LGB youth. The findings point to substantial differences within the homeless youth sample and demonstrate that in addition to the public health risks young people face merely by being homeless, the risks are exacerbated for those who self-identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. The article informs child welfare providers and policymakers about the substantial vulnerability of LGB youth beyond that of non-LGB homeless youth and the need to fund programming, training, technical assistance and further research to specifically respond to the complex needs of this population.

AB  - Young adults experiencing homelessness (YAEH) are at elevated risk for violence victimization and perpetration. However, there are no evidence‐based violence prevention interventions for homeless populations. This study is an evaluation of a novel mindfulness‐based peer‐leader intervention designed to reduce violence and improve mindfulness in YAEH. A social network of YAEH receiving services at a drop‐in agency was recruited in Summer 2018 (n = 106) and peer‐leaders identified at baseline (n = 12). Peer leaders were trained in mindfulness and yoga skills during a 1‐day intensive workshop and seven 1‐h weekly follow‐up workshops and encouraged to share their knowledge with in‐network peers. Postintervention data were collected 2 and 3 months after baseline. Two one‐way repeated‐measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) tested differences in means for mindfulness and fighting. ANOVA models showed significant increases in group mean mindfulness F(2, 110) = 3.42, p < 0.05 and significant decreases in group mean violent behavior F(2, 112) = 5.23, p < 0.01 at the network level. Findings indicate a network‐based, peer‐leader model can be effective for influencing complex, socially conditioned attitudes and behaviors among YAEH. Additional advantages of the peer‐leader model include relatively few direct‐service person‐hours required from providers and convenience to participants able practice skills in their relevant social contexts.

AB  - This study examined the characteristics & predictors of running away for a sample of adolescents (N = 147) in specialized foster care in a managed child welfare agency. Specialized foster care provides a more intensive intervention than regular foster care, but adolescents in SFC may be at high risk of running away because of more troubled histories & previous failures in foster care. Forty-four percent of adolescents ran away at least once during SFC & 22% ran permanently. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, being female & having fewer psychotherapy sessions were associated with running away. These findings can guide program improvements designed to prevent future running away. 2 Tables, 2 Figures, 23 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Purpose:Virtually nothing is known about the potential effects of tobacco advertising on tobacco use among youth experiencing homelessness, a vulnerable population with high tobacco use rates. This study examines associations between the appeal of advertising for 5 classes of tobacco product (electronic cigarettes, hookah, cigars, cigarillos, and smokeless tobacco) and future intentions to use those products again among homeless youth who had indicated any level of lifetime use.Design:A cross-sectional design was used.Setting:Settings were 25 service and street sites in Los Angeles County.Participants:A probability sample of 469 young tobacco users experiencing homelessness (mean age = 22; 71% male; 29% non-Hispanic White) was recruited.Measures:Assessments included product-specific tobacco advertising appeal and future intentions to use the product again, as well as a range of covariate controls (eg, demographics, homelessness severity, current tobacco use, general advertising exposure).Analysis:Linear regression tested for associations between the appeal of advertising for a specific tobacco product and intentions to use that product again in the future, controlling for myriad covariates.Results:Advertising appeal was positively associated with future intentions to use again for electronic cigarettes (P = .006) and hookah (P = .001), but not cigars (P = .486), cigarillos (P = .126), or smokeless tobacco (P = .109).Conclusion:Results suggest that advertising appeal may increase use of certain tobacco products among youth experiencing homelessness. However, differences in themes emphasized by advertising for specific tobacco products could differentially influence use in this population.

AB  - Examines the social characteristics & motivations of young runaways in England, Scotland, & Wales. It is argued that the term "runaway" is often inappropriate in that it implies impulsiveness & irrational action; "refugee" may also be an inappropriate term as it implies that these youth need protection. Analysis of data on 24 youth entering a children's refuge in south Wales indicates that the reasons for entering the refuge & patterns of refuge use vary considerably by gender, race, & ethnicity. Males came to the project less often & worked on a more limited number of issues than did females. Minority youth were overrepresented in the refuge. Many youths had left nonparental residential care arrangements. It is concluded that new initiatives are needed for minority youth & youth in nonparental residential care. 4 Tables, 16 References. M.

AB  - Purpose: Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) experience high rates of violence. We conducted a Youth Participatory Action Research study to better understand the structural and neighborhood factors that exacerbate or inhibit violence targeting YEH in San Francisco. YPAR is ideal to study structural factors, yet there is little research regarding the concrete adaptations required in order to prevent further harm to youth investigators. We describe the experiences of the young investigators and the lessons learned by the research team. Methods: Young people were critical to the design and implementation of the study, including conducting research interviews and data analysis. The young researcher team consisted of 3 young people 'exiting' home-lessness and 3 undergraduate students with lived experience of home-lessness or extensive service experience. Team members completed informed consent to allow for assessment of the YPAR study. Data included in our assessment included short surveys, needs assessments, 1:1 supervision with the project director, team-based supervision and discussion during the course of the study, and exit interviews conducted by a non-study team member. These data were analyzed using thematic analysis and clinical case assessment to produce findings. Results: Major themes included basic needs insecurity, structural barriers to consistent participation in employment, job and life skills training and flexibility, ongoing risks for violence, and pride and satisfaction with their participation. Food insecurity emerged at a concern early in the study. The study team addressed this issue by shifting our resources to ensure we provided at least two meals to youth researchers on every day that they worked on the project. Many youth researchers had never had access to stable, professional employment opportunities or training, they struggled show up to work 'on-time* or to communicate when they would be unavailable for work or had scheduling conflicts, behaviors that would normally lead to termination. The project continually re-oriented to prioritize trauma-informed training over the timely completion of the research protocol, balancing structure and flexibility in order to promote capacity-building and strengths-based participation. Young researchers, especially queer- and female-identified researchers, encountered multiple episodes of environmental harassment and threats of violence during the course of their street-based research in San Francisco, despite careful protocols designed to maximize team safety. Youth described multiple benefits to their participation, including increased ability to give and receive feedback ("I always felt like when I made mistakes it was not the end of the world"); increased perceived self-efficacy in completing a project ('This is what completing something looks like. I hadn't really completed a lot of things"); increased sense of self-worth; and feeling like young people experiencing homelessness are being heard and that "we matter." Conclusions: Participatory- and community-based research with young people experiencing homelessness must flexibly adapt projects to support the basic and complex needs of the young people involved in the research process by developing intentional and continuing trauma-informed approaches to empower participation of young researchers without putting them at further risk of harm. Sources of Support: This study was funded by a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Interdisciplinary Research Leaders award.

AB  - Researchers of street life and homelessness in the United States continue to acknowledge the persistence of nomadism among the young and homeless, yet we know little about the role that travel plays in their lives or the meanings and motivations tied to this contemporary experience. Drawing on in-depth interviews, we compare homeless youth and young adults that travel with those that do not. Building on theories of social networks, social capital, stigma, and identity we explore demographic, behavioral, and philosophical similarities and differences between the two groups to understand the rationale for travel. For the young and homeless today, travel adds to the reserve of strategies to build and maintain network affiliations, acquire resources, and manage stigma and identity as they relate to the hobo and transient traditions of the past. However, when compared to their non-traveling homeless counterparts, travelers face new challenges that offset the purported benefits derived from being mobile.

AB  - Objective: Limited research exists on how employment interventions contribute to employment outcomes for homeless youth. This study examines the comparative efficacy of 2 interventions-Social Enterprise Intervention (SEI) and Individual Placement and Support (IPS)-provided to homeless youth with mental illness in a randomized controlled trial. Method: Participants were recruited from 1 homeless youth agency in Los Angeles, CA, and randomized to the SEI (n = 36) or IPS (n = 36) conditions. Over 20 months, SEI participants received 4 SEI components, and IPS participants received IPS services based on 8 principles. Data were collected at baseline and follow-up for the primary employment outcome (paid employment) and 5 secondary employment outcomes. Results: Over 20 months, 39% of SEI participants and 32% of IPS participants reported any paid employment. Across both groups, participants who reported working at baseline had nearly 8 times the odds of working at follow-up (OR = 7.91, p < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were detected across the full sample or between groups on the primary or secondary employment outcomes. Conclusions: Future effectiveness research is needed to compare the long-term employment outcomes of the SEI and IPS with a more heterogeneous sample of homeless youth using customized homelessness support services and more nuanced employment outcomes.

AB  -  The purpose of this study was to compare young people seeking homeless services in two distinct geographic locations (Austin, Texas and St. Louis, Missouri). To determine differences between the two populations, the study used a guiding conceptual model of social estrangement that included four domains: institutional disaffiliation, psychological dysfunction, human capital, and identification with homeless culture. A sample of homeless youth (N = 96; 46 from St. Louis, 50 from Austin) were recruited through youth-serving agencies. Findings indicate two unique samples of street-involved youth in regards to affiliation with formal institutions, family support, and informal peer networks, suggesting distinct service needs.

AB  - This community‐based study investigated whether (1) a novel sport psychology informed positive youth development program, My Strengths Training for Life™, improved resilience and well‐being and (2) young people differed in outcomes according to demographics (gender, ethnicity, social inclusion, and learning difficulty). A total of 246 young people (M age = 19.74, SD = 2.31) living in a large housing service completed questionnaires on demographics, mental skills, and pre and postprogram resilience and well‐being. Baseline differences in resilience and well‐being existed for ethnicity and learning difficulty status but did not influence MST4Life™ outcomes. There was a significant improvement in resilience and well‐being over time, which was associated with mental skills development. Implications apply for policy, program commissioners, and research: (1) novel sport psychology interventions can improve the well‐being of disadvantaged youth, and (2) demographics at baseline should be considered in intervention planning and evaluation with this population.

AB  - Background Homeless youth experience high rates of substance use disorders, exposures to violence, mental and physical health conditions, and mortality. They have been particularly affected by the opioid crisis. However, no study to date has used a randomized controlled design to test preventive interventions of opioid and other drug use among this vulnerable population. Resolution of youth homelessness through housing and supportive services including prevention services, often referred to as “Housing First,” has great potential to reduce the likelihood for the development of an opioid use disorder as well as other problem behaviors associated with living on the streets. Housing First has been tested through randomized trials among homeless adults with mental health and substance use disorders, but has not been empirically tested for opioid prevention among homeless youth.Methods Homeless youth will be recruited from a drop-in shelter site frequented by disconnected youth; they will be screened for eligibility, including current homelessness, age 18–24 years, and not currently meeting criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). In a controlled trial, 240 youth will then be randomized to one of two conditions, (1) housing + opioid and related risk prevention services, or (2) opioid and related risk prevention services alone. This project utilizes existing efficacious models of prevention to address opioid-related risks, including motivational interviewing, strengths-based outreach and advocacy, and an HIV risk preventive intervention. Follow-up will be conducted at 3, 6, 9 and 12-months post-baseline. The economic cost of each intervention will be determined to support implementation decisions with other providers and their funders.Discussion This study will provide essential information for researchers and providers on the efficacy of housing + opioid and related risk prevention services in an RCT for effects on opioid use and mechanisms underlying change. Because youth experiencing homelessness are at increased risk for a variety of adverse outcomes, the proposed intervention may produce substantial health care benefits to the youths and society at large.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04135703, Registered October 13, 2019, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04135703?term=NCT04135703&draw=2&rank=1#contacts

AB  - Street-involved (SI) youth represent a significant proportion of urban homeless populations. While previous research has identified SI youth as substantial users of emergency department (ED) services and has examined their experiences of ED care, little is known about the experiences and perceptions of the service providers who assist these youth with health care related issues. Using grounded theory, individual interviews and focus groups were conducted with 20 community agency staff serving SI youth, 17 health service providers, two hospital administrators, and two hospital security personnel regarding their experiences in providing or facilitating ED care for SI youth. Results identify differences in expectations between SI youth and hospital staff, along with service issues and gaps, including relational barriers and resource constraints. Implications for practice and policy development are offered.

AB  - Background There have been initiatives to develop innovative services for commercially sexually exploited children (CSEC), but there are currently no intervention strategies that have been rigorously evaluated. However, a range of evidence-based interventions have been identified for other problems that frequently co-occur with CSEC. As intervention programs for victims of CSEC develop, it is important to critically examine the research on interventions for these associated problems to ensure that what is borrowed, adapted, or prioritized is informed by research, and likely to best address the needs of victims. Objective The current review examines evidence-based interventions from related social problem fields that may have useful content for victims of CSEC. Existing systematic reviews were primarily used for this review; however, rigorous and large-scale randomized controlled trials were also included. In total, 33 articles were included. Articles were identified via search engine (e.g., PsychInfo) and reference mining. Review Interventions for adolescent substance use, delinquency, trauma, school dropout, and running away are reviewed for their content and evidence base. Opportunities for integration of CSEC content are discussed using current extant literature. Discussion The most promising practices from related fields include mentorship, multisystemic treatment (MST), family programming/therapy, and kinship foster care. Skill-based interventions (e.g., CBT) have been found to be a particularly effective mental health intervention for youth with similar sequelae to victims of CSEC. Importantly, outcomes improve when interventions are paired with relationship-building strategies such as mentorship or group therapy. Implications for CSEC practice and research are discussed.

AB  - Homeless young adults are more likely than their never-homeless counterparts to abuse substances and engage in sexual risk behaviors. This study evaluated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of OnTrack, a smartphone application to self-monitor substance use and sexual risk behaviors, plus a brief motivational intervention (BMI), in reducing substance use and sexual risk among homeless young adults. A randomized controlled pilot trial (N = 60) compared OnTrack + BMI to treatment as usual (TAU) at an inner-city crisis shelter for homeless young adults (aged 18–21 years). Participants were assessed at baseline and 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks after baseline to evaluate substance use and sexual risk behaviors. Kruskal–Wallis tests determined differences between baseline and postintervention assessments. Logistic regression models examined treatment effect on change in outcomes between baseline and postintervention follow-up assessment, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in OnTrack + BMI significantly reduced past 2-week number of drinks (p = .023), times used marijuana (p = .046), times engaged in unprotected sex (p = .012), and times used drugs before sexual activity (p = .019). No reductions of substance use or sexual risk behaviors were found among participants in TAU (all ps > .05). After adjusting for baseline levels of substance use and sexual risk, participants in OnTrack + BMI had significantly lower odds than those in TAU for drinking alcohol (adjusted OR = 0.14; p = .01) and having unprotected sex (adjusted OR = 0.151; p = .032). OnTrack + BMI is feasible and effective in reducing past 2-week alcohol use and unprotected sex among homeless young adults. A larger randomized trial is warranted to replicate and extend present results.

AB  - Few studies have examined gender-specific factors associated with the nonuse of condoms among homeless & runaway youths (HRYs) -- a population at high risk for HIV infection. In this article, we evaluate these factors & explore gender differences in background experiences, psychosocial functioning, & risk behaviors among HRYs from four US metropolitan areas. Of 879 sexually active HRYs sampled, approximately 70% reported unprotected sexual intercourse during a 6-month period, & nearly 25% reported never using condoms in the same period. Among males & females, having only one sex partner in the previous 6 months had the strongest association with nonuse of condoms. Among males, nonuse was also associated with having ever caused pregnancy, frequent marijuana use, prior physical victimization, & low self-control & sociability. Among females, nonuse was associated with knowledge of HIV status, prior sexual victimization, low social support, & infrequent marijuana use. These findings highlight the ongoing need for HIV prevention services for HRYs. Implications for the scope & content of these services are discussed. 5 Tables, 50 References.

AB  - Depression among women commonly co-occurs with substance abuse. We explore the association between women's depressive symptoms and self-silencing accounting for the effects of known childhood and adult risk indicators. Participants are 233 ethnically diverse, low-income women who abused alcohol/drugs prenatally. Depressive symptomatology was assessed using the Addiction Severity Index. Multivariate logistic regression models examined the association between self-silencing and the dependent depression variable. The full model indicated a 3% increased risk for depressive distress for each point increase in self-silencing score (OR = 1.03; P = .001). Differences in depressive symptomatology by ethnic groups were accounted for by their differences in self-silencing.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Extensive research suggests that transition-age youth (TAY) disproportionately experience periods in which they are either homeless or precariously housed. However, less is understood on the experiences of homelessness among female TAY who are parenting (TAY-M), a particularly vulnerable subgroup of TAY. In an effort to understand the characteristics and needs of TAY-M, this study conducted chi-squared tests to evaluate the differences between homeless and housed TAY-M on demographics, general functioning, and service use at age 21. Findings of this study emphasize the need for targeted interventions for TAY-M who experience homelessness.

AB  - While social scientists have attempted to become informed about the needs and realities of marginalized youth, rarely do they include their voices in these discussions. Yet, research suggests that listening to young people results in the development of more successful programming. The authors examined 30 years of youth writing to understand what program participants think they need. Focusing on youth experiencing homelessness narratives regarding “leaving the street,” the article identifies three themes to guide government officials and program staff in program improvement: (1) the process of becoming ready to leave street life, (2) the factors that cause setbacks to occur, and (3) the recognition of young people’s need for independence and concerns that impact program effectiveness. Finally, using their words, we present suggestions for policy changes perceived to be most beneficial.

AB  - The current analysis examined whether male & female street youth in a midsized Brazilian city differed in their family circumstances & day-to-day functioning on the street. The opportunity sample consisted of 33 male (mean age 14.3, range 10-17 years) & 33 female (mean age 14.6, range 11-18 years) street youth who participated in a sentence completion task & structured interview examining family experiences & ability to meet daily needs on the street. Consistent with the cultural hypothesis, girls described more negative family backgrounds than boys (eg, they were more likely to have left home because of conflict or abuse, & reported more negative relationships with their parents). However, girls' functioning on the street was similar to, & in some cases more positive then, that of boys (eg, fewer girls reported police violence & begging to earn money). The few gender differences that emerged in this study offer little support for the cultural hypothesis. The findings make sense if local factors, such as services available for male & female youth & public response to street youth, are considered. It appears that street youth differ in their experiences depending on local circumstances, highlighting the need for caution in generalizing about the situation of street youth in different countries. 2 Tables, 3 Figures, 37 References.

AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant global public health problem. Understanding risk factors is crucial for developing prevention programmes. Yet, little evidence exists on population-based prevalence and risk factors for IPV in West Africa. Our objective was to measure both lifetime and past year prevalence of IPV and to determine factors associated with past year physical or sexual IPV experience. This population-based survey involved 2000 randomly selected women aged 18 to 49 years living in 40 localities within four districts of the Central Region of Ghana. Questionnaires were interviewer-administered from February to May 2016. Respondents were currently or ever-partnered, and resident in study area ≥12months preceding the survey. Data collected included: socio-demographics; sexual behavior; mental health and substance use; employment status; 12-month and lifetime experience of violence; household food insecurity; gender norms/attitudes; partner characteristics and childhood trauma. Logistic regression modelling was used to determine factors associated with sexual or physical IPV, adjusting for age and survey design. About 34% of respondents had experienced IPV in the past year, with 21.4% reporting sexual and or physical forms. Past year experience of emotional and economic IPV were 24.6% and 7.4% respectively. Senior high school education or higher was protective of IPV (AOR = 0.51[0.30–0.86]). Depression (AOR = 1.06[1.04–1.08], disability (AOR = 2.30[1.57–3.35]), witnessing abuse of mother (AOR = 2.1.98[1.44–2.72]), experience of childhood sexual abuse (AOR = 1.46[1.07–1.99]), having had multiple sexual partners in past year (AOR = 2.60[1.49–4.53]), control by male partner (AOR = 1.03[1.00–1.06]), male partner alcohol use in past year (AOR = 2.65[2.12–3.31]) and male partner infidelity (AOR = 2.31[1.72–3.09]) were significantly associated with increased odds of past year physical or sexual IPV experience. Male perpetrated IPV remains a significant public health issue in Ghana. Evidence-based interventions targeting women’s mental health, disabilities, exposure to violence in childhood, risky sexual behavior and unequal power in relationships will be critical in reducing IPV in this setting.

AB  - In light of recent studies that have questioned the prevalence of abuse experienced by teenage runaways & the causal contribution of such abuse to runaway experiences, offered here are descriptive data on the occurrence, nature, & frequency of physical abuse experienced in a sample of 195 Canadian adolescent runaways at a shelter in Toronto, Ontario. Structured interview data also reveal the age of onset & duration of abuse, the relationship between the victim & the perpetrator(s), & who, if anyone, knew of the abuse. Abuse experienced prior & subsequent to runaway experiences is compared. Results indicate that 86% of the population (74% of the males & 90% of the females) reported at least 1 physically abusive experience. As a whole, these adolescents have been victims of chronic, extreme abuse, experienced at a young age, often perpetrated by the biological parent (most often the mother), & initiated prior to the first runaway episode. Female runaways were at greater risk than males for all types of abuse experience. Once youths left home, the physical abuse experiences decreased in frequency, but grew in severity, particularly for males. 6 Tables, 39 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This article systematically reviews studies exploring resilience among youth experiencing homelessness. We searched eight databases, and 21 articles fit the inclusion criteria and represented four methodologies: qualitative (n = 7, 33.3%), survey and secondary data analysis (n = 8, 38.1%), quantitative (n = 4, 19.1%), and mixed-method (n = 2, 9.5%) designs. Studies indicate that youth experiencing homelessness rely on informal social networks for survival, and that spirituality, mental health, and creativity are associated with enhanced coping. More experimental and intervention studies are necessary to support evidence-based resilience practices. Additionally, researchers need to exercise more self-awareness about how stereotypical pejorative paradigms may constrain innovative, strengths-based scholarship.

AB  - Background LGBTQ2S youth are overrepresented among youth experiencing homelessness and experience significantly higher rates of mental health issues compared to heterosexual and cisgender youth. COVID-19 related challenges for LGBTQ2S youth experiencing homelessness remain unknown. To address this gap, this study aimed to understand the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on LGBTQ2S youth at risk of, and experiencing, homelessness in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada and surrounding areas.Methods Utilizing a mixed-methods convergent parallel design, LGBTQ2S youth experiencing homelessness were recruited to participate in virtual surveys and in-depth one-on-one interviews. Surveys included standardized measures and were administered to measure mental health outcomes and collect information on demographic characteristics, and health service use. Survey data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and statistical tests for difference of proportions. Interviews were analyzed using an iterative thematic content approach.Results Sixty-one youth completed surveys and 20 youth participated in one-on-one interviews. Quantitative and qualitative data showed that youth have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in various ways, including experiencing poor mental health, such as suicidality, depression, anxiety, and increased substance use, and lack of access to health and social support services.Conclusion Our study highlights the need for LGBTQ2S inclusive and affirming health care and support services for precariously housed adolescents to address the pre-existing social and health issues that have been exacerbated by the pandemic.

AB  - Inadequate housing and homelessness among families represent a substantial challenge for child and adolescent well-being. Child welfare services confront housing that threatens placement into foster care with little resources and evidence to guide practice. The present study provides the first rigorous test of the Family Unification Program (FUP) – a federal program that offers housing subsidies for inadequately housed families under investigation for child maltreatment. A randomized controlled trial assesses program impact on foster care placement and costs. The experiment referred intact child welfare-involved families whose inadequate housing threatened foster placement in Chicago, IL to FUP plus housing advocacy (n = 89 families with 257 children) or housing advocacy alone (n = 89 families with 257 children). Families were referred from 2011 to 2013, and administrative data recorded dates and costs of foster placements over a 3-year follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses suggested families randomly assigned for FUP exhibited slower increases in rates of foster placement following housing intervention compared with families referred for housing advocacy alone. The program generates average savings of nearly $500 per family per year to the foster care system. Housing subsidies provide the foster care system small but significant benefits for keeping homeless families together. Findings inform the design of a coordinated child welfare response to housing insecurity.

Increasing percentages of youth were found to reside in families with no change in economic status stratified by class. The rate of economic stasis of youth living in affluent families was more than twice that of those in middle-income families & more than four times that of those in poor families. Little variation in economic mobility was found among affluent families stratified by sex & ethnicity/race, although white males had less downward mobility than black females. Greater variation in economic mobility was found among poor families, with white males having greater upward mobility than other males & white females having greater upward mobility than black females & males. Finally, education was positively related to economic mobility for most subgroups, as was receipt of SSI, while receipt of AFDC/TANF decreased economic mobility only among white males. 4 Tables, 100 References.

AB  - Between 5–9% of American adolescents experience 1+ episode of independent homelessness. Although multiple stressors have consistently been shown to precede runaway behavior, sampling homeless populations fails to capture variation between juveniles who run/do not run. This research uses Waves I and II of the Add Health public use data to examine conditions likely to result in a first-time run among males vs. females. Specifically, we argue that strains/negative emotion derived from Agnew’s general strain theory and social controls derived from Hirschi’s social bond theory will act as positive and negative motivations, respectively, to predict first-time runs. We find significant, main effects on running for multiple strain and control measures. However, results of our integrated models suggest that, while composite strain and depression increase the odds of running across gender, composite social control is associated with lower odds of running for females only. This finding underscores prior research suggesting that social bonds may have a stronger protective impact on females considering a first-time run.

AB  - RESUMEN: Este artículo informa los resultados del primer estudio longitudinal y representativo de una cohorte de jóvenes que salen de la tutela en Quebec, Canada (estudio EDJeP). Centárndonos en la educación y la estabilidad residencial, mostraremos que los jóvenes de los servicios de protección juvenil acumulan vulnerabilidades importantes que hacen que su transición fuera de los servicios de protección juvenil sea muy desafiante. M´s específicamente, en comparación con sus pares en la población general, los jóvenes que salen del sistema de proteccion juvenil tienen un importante retraso educativo que complica su integración en el mercado de trabajo. Nuestros datos sugieren que un sistema que fomente mejor la perseverancia y el éxito escolar limitaría estos retrasos académicos y favorecería la graduación. También encontramos que cerca de la mitad de los jóvenes del sistema de protección experimentaron inestabilidad residencial en los meses posteriores a su salida del acogimiento y que el 20% de ellos experimentó al menos un episodio de sinhogarismo. Estos últimos elementos muestran claramente la medida de la vulnerabilidad de los jóvenes que salen del sistema de protección. Sugerimos algunas áreas de reflexión para mejorar esa situacion.

AB  - Historically, insufficient resources and assistance have been provided to young people leaving state care. Care leavers have been found to experience significant health, social and educational deficits including homelessness, disproportionate involvement in juvenile crime and prostitution, poor social supports and early parenthood. This paper compares the UK and Australian debates around improving outcomes for care leavers. Whilst there are some minor differences in the respective legislative frameworks and responses, the similarities are far greater. Both countries have failed to provide the range of in-care, transitional and post-care supports and services required to ensure improved outcomes for care leavers. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The purpose of this secondary analysis of data from an ongoing, longitudinal intervention study for homeless youths (ages 18–24 years) was threefold: (1) to differentiate by age, sex, and sexual orientation, the positive attributes of hope, optimism, resilience, future time perspective, and gratitude, (2) to determine how these positive attributes might be related to life satisfaction, and (3) to determine which set of variables might best explain life satisfaction. We found a statistically significant difference in resilience scores by sex, H(2) = 6.591, p = .037, with males scoring higher than females. None of the other positive attributes differed significantly by sex. Future time perspective (FTP) differed significantly by sexual orientation with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth scoring higher than others on FTP (p = .046). All theoretical variables (hope, optimism, FTP, resilience, and gratitude) were significantly related to life satisfaction (p < .01). After controlling for all other variables, hope and gratitude significantly explained variance in life satisfaction (p < .001). This analysis supports the claim that despite their vulnerabilities and limitations, homeless youths have many positive attributes that are related to their life satisfaction. It may be that future interventions focused on positive attributes of hope and gratitude can be developed to further enhance psychological capital and contribute to life satisfaction among these young people.

AB  - The federal government enacted the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (MVA) to equip schools with services to help alleviate the many barriers students experiencing homelessness face in pursuit of educational opportunities. Educational agencies use federally mandated liaisons to uphold the provisions of the MVA. Despite the homeless liaisons' importance in facilitating the policy, few studies have examined how liaisons perceive their service area's response to homelessness. This study explored homeless liaisons' perceptions of MVA implementation in their service areas. Researchers invited every homeless liaison in three southern states to complete an online survey focusing on perceptions of MVA implementation and their service area's response to homelessness. Of the 369 practitioners identified as a homeless liaison solicited for study participation, 32 percent completed surveys. Results indicated significant differences in perceived implementation in the level of collaboration with teachers and school administrators, liaisons' job titles, school's receipt of federal Education for Homeless Children and Youth funding, and awareness of homelessness in terms of general awareness, interaction, policy, and needs. Findings indicate that collaboration and awareness are major factors that affect perceptions of implementation. Furthermore, the results indicate that liaisons must take steps to ensure a collaborative environment to implement the MVA.

AB  - Runaway youth report a broader range and higher severity of substance-related, mental health and family problems relative to non-runaway youth. Most studies to date have collected self-report data on the family and social history; virtually no research has examined treatment effectiveness with this population. This study is a treatment development project in which 124 runaway youth were randomly assigned to (1) ecologically based family therapy (EBFT) or (2) service as usual (SAU) through a shelter. Youth completed an intake, posttreatment, 6 and 12 months follow-up assessment. Youth assigned to EBFT reported greater reductions in overall substance abuse compared to youth assigned to SAU while other problem areas improved in both conditions. Findings suggest that EBFT is an efficacious intervention for this relatively severe population of youth. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Purpose: Many young people, particularly those who are marginalized and most at risk for HIV and reproductive health-related problems, cannot or will not seek traditional facility-based health services. Policies and programs are being implemented to provide them with these health services in the community. We sought to review the effectiveness of such approaches in increasing HIV and reproductive health service use. Methods: A systematic literature review was undertaken to identify policies promoting or programs delivering HIV or reproductive health services in the community. We reviewed studies that evaluated uptake of services or commodities. Data from studies meeting inclusion criteria were qualitatively analyzed. Results: Twenty studies met inclusion criteria, including 10 containing comparative data (e.g., before and after study or control study design). The studies generally demonstrated positive impact, although results varied across settings and approaches. The most successful approaches included mail-based chlamydia screening in the Netherlands, condom distribution via street outreach in Louisiana, home-based HIV counseling and testing in Malawi, and promotion of over-the-counter access to emergency contraception in various countries. Conclusions: Overall, this review suggests that out-of-facility approaches can be important avenues to reach youth. Continued evaluation is necessary to better understand specific approaches that can successfully deliver health services. [Copyright The Society for Adolescent Medicine; published by Elsevier Inc.]

AB  - Purpose: To explore the factors that differentiate trafficked homeless youth from not-trafficked homeless youth. Methods: From November 2015–February 2017, homeless youth served by Covenant House New Jersey, aged 18–22, received a trafficking assessment. Youth were stratified based upon trafficking experience, and their responses to demographic and social history questions were examined for association with trafficking occurrence. Results: Of 344 participants, 9.6% had a trafficking experience. Having an Individualized Education Program/504 plan was, for the first time in anti-trafficking literature, associated with a trafficking experience in bivariable analysis. IEP/504 plans are developed for school-aged children whose ability to succeed in traditional educational formats is challenged by learning, social, or functional problems. In the multivariable analysis, a history of arrest was associated with being trafficked while the presence of a supportive adult was associated with not being trafficked. Gender was not associated with a trafficking experience. Conclusions: This study is the largest to specifically assess homeless youth's demographic and social variables for association with trafficking experience. Homeless youth who are and are not trafficked share similar life experiences, but those with a supportive adult in their life had lower odds of being trafficked. Building upon our research, future investigations exploring order of occurrence will elucidate the risk factors for and protective factors against trafficking among homeless youth, contributing to evidence-based prevention efforts.

AB  - BackgroundChild homelessness has been associated with elevated mental health problems during early adolescence, a period of onset for psychiatric problems. Prior literature has relied on cross-sectional studies, limiting the understanding of temporality and trajectories of psychopathology. We extend prior literature by examining associations between child homelessness and internalising and externalising symptom trajectories in early adolescence, with consideration of timing and persistence of homelessness.MethodsUsing population-based longitudinal data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we used multilevel models to examine the effects of homelessness prior to age 9, the timing of homelessness (eg, early vs middle childhood) and cumulative exposure to homelessness on internalising and externalising trajectories across ages <0–9 years. We also tested for sex differences in these associations.ResultsOf the 8391 participants, 5.5% reported exposure to homelessness at least once before age 9. Children who experienced homelessness had elevated internalising and externalising symptoms compared with their consistently housed peers, with excess risk evident among children who first experienced homelessness in middle childhood (relative to early childhood) and children who experienced recurrent homelessness. We did not observe changes in symptom trajectories over the course of 4 years. Men who experienced homelessness displayed a more pronounced risk of internalising symptoms relative to women and men who did not experience homelessness.ConclusionChildhood homelessness is associated with persistently elevated internalising and externalising symptoms across early adolescence compared with their consistently housed peers. Interventions and policies to address family homelessness may lead to better mental health among adolescents.

AB  - Using a large survey of Czech high school students (n = 1103), aged 15-20 years, this paper explores youth prejudice to a wide range of minority groups (n = 21) where family, school, and community contexts are taken into account. General Structural Equation Models are used to explore the determinants of prejudice for 21 minorities using a comparative explanatory framework where the focus is gender differences in prejudice to minorities are examined using three social theories: Social Dominance Theory (SDT), the Theory of Gendered Prejudice (TGP), and Gender Role Beliefs (GRB). This research shows that gender plays a strong role in expressing prejudiced attitudes where females express (a) less prejudiced attitudes toward the Roma, black Africans, Gays and those with mental or physical disabilities, and (b) more prejudiced attitudes towards the homeless, Vietnamese, Muslims, and lesbians. This gendered pattern is explained in terms of insights from SDT, TGP, and GRB.

AB  - Goals of this study were to examine the frequency of depression & related constructs of suicidal ideation & hopelessness in a sample of homeless older adolescents & their associations with behaviors that may increase the risk of sexually transmitted disease (STD). Diagnostic interviews & blood/urine samples were obtained from 523 homeless adolescents (mean age=17.8). Overall, 12.2 per cent had a current DSM-IV diagnosis of major depression & 6.5 per cent had dysthymia, with higher rates for female & older participants. Depression appeared to precede rather than follow homelessness & was associated with biologically verified STDs (in older participants), infrequent condom use, a non-heterosexual orientation (in older participants), & lifetime homosexual experience. Unlike depression, suicidal ideation & hopelessness were associated with higher rates of intravenous drug use but lower rates of multiple sex partners &, in young homeless women, less sexual coercion. Depression is frequent in homeless older adolescents & has a complex association with STD-related behaviors. 2 Tables, 48 References.

AB  - While many homeless youth use cell phones to stay socially connected, and maintaining positive social ties can contribute to pathways out of homelessness, little is known about how using cell phones for data collection can improve these young people's lives. We conducted baseline and follow-up interviews with 150 homeless youth as well as provided them with a cell phone for 30 days to gather daily data using short message service (SMS) surveying. This paper examines youths' opinions about study participation and how they used the cell phone. Results revealed that youth liked participating in the study because the SMS texting portion, for example, made them feel that someone still cared about them, prompted them to self-reflect on their life, and allowed them to make a difference (e.g. educating the public about homelessness). Despite numerous benefits of study participation, improvements that youth discussed for future studies included changing the format of our text questions to allow for explanations and the use of higher quality phones. In terms of study phone usage, youth reported using the phone to schedule appointments, contact employers, and to keep in touch with family and friends. Finally, we highlight ways in which cell phones via SMS could be used with homeless youth to provide informational resources along with educational and employment opportunities, all of which are important intervention strategies in improving life situations for this population.

The finding shows that there has been a continual increase in the number of articles on runaway and homeless youth issues over the last decade in both countries. The result of the analysis by content categories indicates American articles have explored more diverse topics and have focused on addressing the problems, while South Korean articles have focused on understanding the causes of becoming a runaway and offering service provision. The analysis of sampling frames shows American articles have mainly used 'street youth sampling,' whereas South Korean articles have utilized 'shelter youth sampling'. The result of analysis by research methods indicates that 'descriptive design' is the most shared common research method across the two countries. These findings highlight the differences between research trends of the two countries. Implications for future research are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - In the present report we describe patterns of traumatic events and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), both partial and full, among homeless youth and those at risk for homelessness, with an emphasis on gender differences. Participants were 85 homeless and at-risk youth (49% female) recruited from a drop-in center in New York City in 2000. Youth completed a structured interview lasting 1.5 h. Rates of childhood maltreatment were substantial. Further, almost all youth experienced at least one traumatic event, with most experiencing multiple types of trauma. Gender differences were found in the types, but not prevalence or magnitude, of childhood maltreatment and traumatic events experienced. Partial symptomatology of PTSD was common for females but not males. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were found to co-occur with PTSD for females, which may complicate treatment efforts. Further investigation of the impact of trauma on homeless males is needed. [Copyright 2006 Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.]

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare young people seeking homeless services in two distinct geographic locations (Austin, Texas and St. Louis, Missouri). To determine differences between the two populations, the study used a guiding conceptual model of social estrangement that included four domains: institutional disaffiliation, psychological dysfunction, human capital, and identification with homeless culture. A sample of homeless youth (N = 96; 46 from St. Louis, 50 from Austin) were recruited through youth-serving agencies. Findings indicate two unique samples of street-involved youth in regards to affiliation with formal institutions, family support, and informal peer networks, suggesting distinct service needs.

AB  -  This study examines changes in the characteristics of the homeless population before and after a period of extended economic expansion (1992-2002). Data from other sources suggest that, during this 10-year period, the size of the overall population of homeless persons may have declined slightly, though not significantly, both in the city studied and nationally. In-depth surveys of representative samples of homeless adults (N = 249 in 1992-94; N = 220 in 2000-2002) revealed significant differences in the composition of the homeless population across the time period, consistent with queuing theory. Persons experiencing homelessness after the expansion appeared to be a more "chronic," less readily employable population than those interviewed at the start of the expansion: Those interviewed after were older, spent more time living on the streets, had more health symptoms, were more likely to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and had more restricted social networks and social support. Policy, research, and service provision implications of the findings are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

The same measures were used across nations and a systemic translation procedure assured comparability of measurement. The two samples were similar on some measures: In both nations, most homeless adults were male, many reported having dependent children and experiencing out-of-home placements when they themselves were children, and high levels of physical health problems were observed. Significant national differences were also found: Those in Poland were older, had been homeless for longer, showed lower rates on all psychiatric diagnoses assessed (including severe mental and substance abuse disorders), reported less contact with family and supportive network members, were less satisfied when they sought support from their networks, and reported fewer recent stressful life events and fewer risky sexual behaviors. Culturally-informed interpretations of these findings and their implications are presented.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Youth in foster care are twice as likely to run away from living situations as compared to those of the same age in the general population. When youth are on the run from a living situation, they are at a high risk for being exposed to abuse and neglect or engaging in criminal behavior. One approach to support youth who run is to identify the function of their behavior and then implement interventions that match the function. The Functional Assessment Interview for Runways (FAIR) is an idiosyncratic assessment tool that seeks to identify the function of runaway behavior specific to youth involved with the foster care system. This article provides a summary of the literature related to runaway behavior, the implications for function based interventions, and instructions for administering the FAIR.

AB  - Purpose: Although youth living in rural areas experience homelessness at similar rates as youth living in urban areas, most research with homeless youth has focused on urban contexts. Little is known about health needs of rural homeless youth or about differences among these populations. Resources targeting youth homelessness are limited generally but are particularly sparse in rural areas. Understanding the unique health needs of different populations of homeless youth is critical for designing interventions. We sought to assess geographic differences in health outcomes and healthcare utilization among unaccompanied homeless youth. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from 9th and 11th graders who responded to the statewide Minnesota Student Survey in 2016. The survey assessed whether youth had "stayed in a shelter, somewhere not intended as a place to live, or someone else's home because [they] had no other place to stay?" One-percent of the overall sample (n=802) endorsed the answer answered "Yes-I was on my own without any adult family" and were, thus, included in our analytic sample. Among unaccompanied homeless youth: half (50%) were from Greater Minnesota ("rural"), mirroring the distribution of the overall sample (48% rural, 52% urban); 58% were male; 68% were white; 26% identified as lesbian, gay or bisexual; and 47% received free and reduced lunch (an indicator of poverty). We performed multivariable logistic regression to compare 5 health outcomes (self-reported general health; depressive symptoms; suicide attempts in past year; history of ever having sex; history of experiencing a pregnancy [self or partner]) between groups, controlling for demographics. We also conducted chi-square analyses to compare receipt of a preventive health visit in the prior year, as recommended by adolescent care guidelines, among rural and urban homeless youth. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between rural and urban youth with regards to health and health care utilization outcomes. Controlling for demographics, rural and urban youth reported similar levels of: very good or excellent health (45% for both groups); depressive symptoms (rural: 36% vs urban: 35%); suicide attempts (22% vs. 23%); ever having sex (65% vs. 64% ); experiencing a pregnancy (11% vs. 10%); and having received a preventive health visit in the prior year (56% vs. 61%, all p≥.05). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare health indicators between rural and urban unaccompanied homeless youth. Findings from this statewide sample suggest that youth face similar general-, mental-, and sexual health risks, regardless of their geographic context. The prevalence of these risks is notably higher than that found among stably-housed populations of youth. Despite the prevalence of homelessness among both urban and rural youthd and the significant associated riskdmost interventions and programs focus on urban youth. Given the known differences in experiences of youth homelessness in rural communities, tailored interventions for this population are critical. High levels of well-child care highlight the potential of primary care as a point of screening and intervention. Future research is needed to identify how to best tailor interventions for rural youth facing homelessness.

AB  - Experiencing sexual victimization prior to becoming homeless is common among homeless youth and is associated with increased HIV risk behavior. This study examined mediating variables that underlie this association, adding to the understanding of gender differences in these paths. Participants were homeless youth in Los Angeles recruited through service access centers who completed a computerized self-administered interview in English or Spanish using an iPad. Findings indicate a high presence of sexual victimization across both genders. Female participants experienced posttraumatic stress disorder and subsequent engagement with exchange sex, whereas male participants were primarily involved in substance use risk pathways. Results indicate paths in the association between sexual victimization and HIV risk behavior differ between male and female homeless youth. Gender-specific, mental-health-informed interventions targeting sexual risk reduction are warranted.

AB  - This analysis compares the effects of maternal and paternal incarceration on adult daughters' and sons' criminal justice system (CJS) involvement. Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) are used to examine differences by parent and offspring sex in the effect of parental incarceration on respondents' self-reported arrest, conviction, and incarceration after age 18 (N = 15,587). Net of controls, both maternal and paternal incarceration significantly increase log odds of adult offspring CJS involvement. This effect is especially pronounced for same-sex parent-child dyads, suggesting that the salience of parental incarceration for adult offending outcomes is gendered. In addition, intimate partner abuse and running away are significant predictors of adult CJS involvement for women, but not for men. The results suggest the importance of examining parental incarceration using a gendered, developmental framework such as gendered pathways, as well as the need for gender-responsive correctional programming.

AB  - Data from the AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) Evaluation of Street Outreach Project conducted by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention are drawn on to investigate the demographic & lifestyle characteristics of 245 street youth in Los Angeles & San Diego, CA, 1993-1995. Results revealed high rates of problem behaviors & health risks: 34% reported affiliation with gangs, & 40% reported involvement in illegal activities such as prostitution, drug dealing, mugging, or stealing. Early adolescent street youth (ages 12-15) differed from older street youth on several demographic & lifestyle measures, & it is concluded that early adolescents are especially at risk for negative psychological & physical consequences of street life. 4 Tables, 33 References.

AB  - Purpose: Trading sexual activities for money, dugs, food, shelter, protection or basic needs (also defined as sexual exploitation among adolescents under age 18) can have significant health consequences, and ranges widely among youth sub-groups, from around 1% in school populations to over 40% among homeless youth. Most research has focused on adolescent girls, with some about boys, but limited research includes transgender youth. Transgender youth appear to be more likely to be victims of violence and sexual abuse than their peers, two commonly identified risks for trading sex. This study aimed to identify predictors of trading sex or sexual exploitation among transgender youth in Canada. Methods: Data were drawn from the 2014 Canadian Trans Youth Health Survey, a national on-line survey of youth age 14 to 25, from those who responded to questions about ever trading sex (N=656). Of those, 276 (42.5%) identified as transmasculine, 107 (16.5%) as transfeminine, and 266 (41%) as non-binary; mean age M=20.68, SD=2.88; 45.5% identified as ethnic minority or mixed ethnicity. We identified predictor variables using bivariate logistic regressions, and odds ratios as indicators of effect size. Results: A tenth of participants (66, 10.1%) reported having traded sex (22.7% were under 18). Of those who had traded sex, 32.8% were assigned male at birth, and 67.2% were assigned female; 37.9% identified as transmasculine, 22.7% as transfeminine, and 39.4% as non-binary. Youth who had been sexually abused were 20 times more likely to trade sex, and victims of sexual assault were over 7 times more likely. There was no difference among gender identities for trading sex. People who identified as a person of color or mixed ethnicity had higher odds of trading sex than those who identified as white (OR=2.7), and those of Aboriginal or Indigenous ethnicity higher odds (OR=4.1) than their peers. Participants were over 4 times more likely to trade sex if they had run away from home, or obtained trans-related hormones from illicit sources. Those who used injected drugs had higher odds (OR=11.9) of trading sex, as well as those who used illicit drugs (OR=7.9). Conclusions: No gender differences were found, contradicting the general perception transwomen are at greater risk of exploitation or trading sex, however, visible ethnic minorities appeared more vulnerable, suggesting racism plays a role in exploitation. Sexual abuse as a major predictor emphasizes the need to identify and support victims early; health professionals should screen for sexual abuse among transgender adolescents. Additionally, odds of trading sex were much higher for runaway or homeless youth, those with food insecurity or illicit substance use, suggesting the importance of social safety nets for trans youth. Finally, results suggest the need to improve support and access to hormone treatments for trans youth, as those who cannot get them through health care may access them through illicit sources, and increase their odds of trading sex to afford them.

AB  - Most of what we know about sexual abuse comes from efforts to examine female children victimized by men. Although some researchers have identified similarities between male & female victims of sexual abuse, few studies have examined gender-specific factors associated with sexual health practices among homeless adolescents. The aim of this study was to explore how gender and history of sexual abuse influence cognitive-perceptual & behavioral factors associated with sexual health practices of homeless adolescents. This study was a secondary analysis of data collected for a cross-sectional study of the sexual health practices of homeless adolescents. The sample consisted of 414 youths (104 males who reported sexual abuse & 124 who did not; & 95 females who reported sexual abuse & 75 who did not; 16 did not provide these data). Homeless adolescent females with a history of sexual abuse scored higher (indicating a shorter perspective) on a measure of future time perspective than females with no sexual abuse. Males who reported no sexual abuse scored higher than abused females on perceived health status & higher than abused males on assertive communication. With respect to perceived health status, males who reported no sexual abuse scored significantly higher than females who reported sexual abuse (p = .04). Males with no sexual abuse had significantly higher assertive communication scores than did males who had experienced sexual abuse (p = .015). We found that male & female abuse victims differ in terms of their cognitive-perceptual & behavioral factors associated with sexual health practices. Early identification of those who have been abused is critical so that interventions can be developed. Effective short-term interventions are needed for the adolescent victims of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA), particularly those who are homeless & prone to further sexual victimization.

AB  - Services for homeless youth traditionally provided shelter and nourishment but do little to break the cycle of homelessness. A more comprehensive approach to serve homeless youth is the drop-in center model that provides safe and easy-to-find facilities within communities to bridge the gap between the streets and transitional/permanent housing. Research describing homeless youth who utilize drop-in centers is lacking. This study examines characteristics/ preferences of 96 homeless adolescents attending one of two drop-in centers in Southern California. Homeless youth reported high prevalence of risk behaviors regardless of the center of attendance. Furthermore, our analyses revealed significant differences related to demographics, sexual risk behaviors, and substance use between homeless youth at the two drop-in centers. These findings illuminate the specific characteristics and preferences of homeless youth who attend drop-in centers and can be used to inform providers, advocates, and policy makers.

AB  - Objective: Few studies have assessed the outcomes of runaway/homeless youth that seek assistance from shelter or crisis services, which would provide much needed documentation of intervention effectiveness & point to new directions for service provision. The goals of the current study were to: (1) assess short-term outcomes among runaway/homeless youth using emergency shelters & crisis services & (2) compare short-term outcomes achieved by runaway/ homeless youth in crisis shelters with similar youth using other, longer-term treatment modalities. Method: The study sampled 261 youth using runaway/homeless shelters from four midwestern states at intake & six-weeks post discharge & 47 high-risk youth using longer-term services at intake & six weeks post intake; ten key outcome variables were assessed. Results: Every outcome variable demonstrated improvement post intervention: days on the run, school suspension &/or detention, & sexual activity decreased; perceived family support & selfesteem increased; & youth were more likely to be currently employed & less likely to have been fired. In comparing runaway/homeless crisis shelter users with day treatment users on the ten outcome variables, there were no significant differences across any of the outcome variables. Conclusions: Despite limitations, the research provides evidence for the short-term effectiveness of crisis shelter services for runaway/homeless youth. 4 Tables, 27 References.

AB  - IntroductionAmong youth, the prevalence of mental health and addiction (MHA) disorders is roughly 20%, yet youth are challenged to access evidence-based services in a timely fashion. To address MHA system gaps, this study tests the benefits of an Integrated Collaborative Care Team (ICCT) model for youth with MHA challenges. A rapid, stepped-care approach geared to need in a youth-friendly environment is expected to result in better youth MHA outcomes. Moreover, the ICCT approach is expected to decrease service wait-times, be more youth-friendly and family-friendly, and be more cost-effective, providing substantial public health benefits.Methods and analysisIn partnership with four community agencies, four adolescent psychiatry hospital departments, youth and family members with lived experience of MHA service use, and other stakeholders, we have developed an innovative model of collaborative, community-based service provision involving rapid access to needs-based MHA services. A total of 500 youth presenting for hospital-based, outpatient psychiatric service will be randomised to ICCT services or hospital-based treatment as usual, following a pragmatic randomised controlled trial design. The primary outcome variable will be the youth's functioning, assessed at intake, 6 months and 12 months. Secondary outcomes will include clinical change, youth/family satisfaction and perception of care, empowerment, engagement and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Intent-to-treat analyses will be used on repeated-measures data, along with cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, to determine intervention effectiveness.Ethics and disseminationResearch Ethics Board approval has been received from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, as well as institutional ethical approval from participating community sites. This study will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Participants will provide informed consent prior to study participation and data confidentiality will be ensured. A data safety monitoring panel will monitor the study. Results will be disseminated through community and peer-reviewed academic channels.Trial registration numberClinicaltrials.gov NCT02836080.

AB  - BackgroundHomelessness has been linked to premature mortality but the relationship with biomedical risk factors is uncertain.MethodsWe analysed data from 8581 participants in the 1970 British Birth Cohort Study. Homelessness and type of experience were self-reported at 30 years of age. Nine biomarkers outcomes were collected at 46 years of age: body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, total and high-density cholesterol, triglycerides, glycated haemoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP), insulin-like growth factor 1 and we computed the 10-year risk for coronary heart disease.ResultsBy 30 years of age, 5.8% of participants had been homeless with sofa surfing the most common experience (4.3%). Homelessness was associated with socioeconomic disadvantage, mental health problems and substance use in early adulthood, but these differences were not expressed in biomarkers. After accounting for early adulthood characteristics, residing in a bed and breakfast was associated with a higher BMI (0.59, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.05) and CRP (0.16, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.29), squatting with a lower BMI (−1.69, 95% CI –3.08 to −0.21) and rough sleeping with a higher 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.05).ConclusionsExposure to homelessness in early adulthood was essentially unrelated to biomarkers in middle age. Inconsistent links were found for specific types of experience.

AB  - Given high levels of health and psychological costs associated with the family disruption of homelessness, identifying predictors of runaway and homeless episodes is an important goal. The current study followed 179 substance abusing, shelter-recruited adolescents who participated in a randomized clinical trial. Predictors of runaway and homeless episodes were examined over a two year period. Results from the hierarchical linear modeling analysis showed that family cohesion and substance use, but not family conflict or depressive symptoms, delinquency, or school enrollment predicted future runaway and homeless episodes. Findings suggest that increasing family support, care and connection and reducing substance use are important targets of intervention efforts in preventing future runaway and homeless episodes amongst a high risk sample of adolescents.

AB  - Adolescents who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) are overrepresented among runaway and homeless youth (RHY) and experience increased rates of sexual victimization, mental health issues, and substance use in comparison to their heterosexual and cisgender peers. Additionally, some sexual minority homeless youth experience discrimination in RHY programs, indicating the importance of services tailored to their specific needs. However, we know very little about the availability of these services, particularly in transitional living programs (TLPs). This exploratory study examines the services offered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau-funded TLPs in the United States -- including LGBTQ-specific services -- and examines the differences between programs that offer these specific services and those that do not. Participants (N = 124 programs) completed a survey by phone or email about their program characteristics and services; we supplemented the survey with an analysis of content on programs' websites and Facebook pages, including program descriptions, service availability, and LGBTQ-related content. Fewer than half (43.5%) of the participants reported offering LGBTQ-specific services; information regarding these services was minimally present on the agency's websites (20.2%) or Facebook pages (5.3%). These programs were more likely to be located on the West Coast or in the Northeast region, and more likely to offer counseling, support groups, and recreation or youth development activities. Our findings add to the limited body of knowledge regarding service provision in TLPs, and indicate high unmet need among this vulnerable population. We conclude with implications for social work research, policy and practice.

AB  - While in school, it is a wonderful time to begin to teach upcoming professionals about giving back to the communities they live or work within. These young adults can inspire the next generation of students to do the same. Participating in service learning allows students to see the impact of their hard efforts on the communities they serve. Witnessing the specific needs or purposes that need to be addressed by the community should inspire the students to get involved in order to make a difference. Teaching should focus on enabling students to enter the workplace, including opportunities for personal development.

AB  - Analysis reported here examined youth in residential group home placements in order to better understand how sexual behaviors, drug use, and environmental experiences differ by race and gender subgroups. Data were collected from 336 youth aged 14–21 residing in one of 41 group homes in Maryland. Chi square and logistic regression analyses were done to determine differences on study variables among the race-gender groupings. Results demonstrate not only significant health concerns overall but notable differences were also found between race-gender subgroups. Findings suggest that found race-gender subgroup differences might be informative for tailoring programming for youth of residential group home settings.

AB  - The social composition of an unselected sample of 282 English children & adolescents aged eight to 16 years involved in intensive training in four sports, football, swimming, tennis & gymnastics, was investigated. Working class children & children from lone parent families were under-represented in all sports. The costs of participation in intensive training were determined, & it was concluded that financial considerations as well as difficulties of access to training facilities were major deterrents to participation by disadvantaged children. Over a period of a two year follow up, working class children were more likely to withdraw from intensive training than middle class children. 4 Tables, 3 Figures, 12 References.

AB  - Youth experiencing homelessness experience violence victimization, substance use, suicide risk, and sexual risk disproportionately, compared with their stably housed peers. Yet few large-scale assessments of these differences among high school students exist. The youth risk behavior survey (YRBS) is conducted biennially among local, state, and nationally representative samples of U.S. high school students in grades 9–12. In 2019, 23 states and 11 local school districts included a measure for housing status on their YRBS questionnaire. The prevalence of homelessness was assessed among states and local sites, and relationships between housing status and violence victimization, substance use, suicide risk, and sexual risk behaviors were evaluated using logistic regression. Compared with stably housed students, students experiencing homelessness were twice as likely to report misuse of prescription pain medicine, three times as likely to be threatened or injured with a weapon at school, and three times as likely to report attempting suicide. These findings indicate a need for intervention efforts to increase support, resources, and services for homeless youth.

AB  - Introduction: Homeless and precariously housed young people are a complex, vulnerable population frequently perceived as being difficult to engage in health and social services. Although unrecognized deficits in cognitive functioning may adversely affect their ability to access assistance and meaningfully participate in programming, few researchers have examined these deficits. The purpose of this study was to examine the extent of global and domain-specific cognitive impairment of street involved young people. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted using intake data from 494 clients (64% male; average age of 21 years) enrolled in a community-based inner city mental health program in Vancouver, Canada. Descriptive statistics were used to examine performance on six cognitive domains for a subsample (N = 44) referred for neuropsychological evaluation and bivariate statistics were used to compare youth who were and were not referred. Results: Cognitive impairment was evident in 80% of referred clients, with the most frequent difficulties involving attention and processing speed. Approximately 51% of clients referred for testing did not have more than a grade ten education and only 5% received government support for those with significant disabilities. Apart from alcohol use disorder, no significant differences were identified on sociodemographic and mental health variables between groups of referred and non-referred clients. Conclusions: Significant cognitive impairment was found in 80% of the young people referred for neuropsychological evaluation. This level of impairment combined with high levels of early school exiting and low levels of government support highlight the need for targeted screening to facilitate early identification and intervention.

AB  - Despite great interest in adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), there has been limited research on racial and ethnic differences in their prevalence. Prior research in the United States suggests that the prevalence of ACEs varies along socioeconomic lines, but it is uncertain whether there are racial/ethnic differences in ACE rates among low-income populations. This study examined the distribution of ACEs in a sample of 1523 low-income women in Wisconsin that received home visiting services. Participants ranging in age from 16 to 50 years were coded into five racial/ethnic groups, including Hispanics and four non-Hispanic groups: blacks, whites, American Indians, and other race. Following measurement conventions, ten dichotomous indicators of child maltreatment and household dysfunction were used to create a composite ACE score. Five other potential childhood adversities were also assessed: food insecurity, homelessness, prolonged parental absence, peer victimization, and violent crime victimization. Results from bivariate and multivariate analyses revealed that, while rates of adversity were high overall, there were significant racial/ethnic differences. Total ACE scores of American Indians were comparable to the ACE scores of non-Hispanic whites, which were significantly higher than the ACE scores of non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics. Whites were more likely than blacks to report any abuse or neglect, and they were more likely than blacks and Hispanics to report any household dysfunction. The results underscore the need to account for socioeconomic differences when making racial/ethnic comparisons. Potential explanations for the observed differences are examined.

AB  - Behavioural problems are a recurring issue in the child welfare system population. Normative residential centres do not have the characteristics to address the specific needs of these adolescents, so they are usually treated at therapeutic residential centres. In Catalonia (Spain), these cases are treated in intensive educational residential centres (CREIs), a variant of therapeutic residential care (TRC) facilities. This exploratory study seeks to understand the treatment progress of adolescents with severe behavioural problems who were placed in the CREIs, a variant of TRC facilities. Data from 206 cases, the totality of population under treatment in the CREIs, were collected using a questionnaire administered to the treating team. A cross‐sectional design was used, applying quantitative methods to analyse the incidence and interrelation of a series of variables related to the progress of adolescents in the CREIs. Significant differences among profiles by sex, place of origin, criminal offences, substance abuse and mental health disorders were found. Furthermore, adolescents who performed a positive treatment progress according to the professional staff arrived at the CREI at an earlier age and had longer stays than the group with an unremarkable progress. Logistic regression indicated that duration of stay in the centre and runaways predict the adolescents' treatment progress. This treatment is working well with the milder cases; however, it does not tend to be successful for adolescents with greater difficulties. It is recommended that interventions focus on factors that engage the adolescents in their own rehabilitation process, include substance abuse programmes and consider the gender perspective.

AB  - Chronically homeless individuals with alcohol dependence experience severe alcohol-related consequences. It is therefore important to identify factors that might be associated with reduced alcohol-related harm, such as the use of safer-drinking strategies. Whereas effectiveness of safer-drinking strategies has been well-documented among young adults, no studies have explored this topic among more severely affected populations, such as chronically homeless individuals with alcohol dependence. The aims of this study were thus to qualitatively and quantitatively document safer-drinking strategies used in this population. Participants (N = 31) were currently or formerly chronically homeless individuals with alcohol dependence participating in a pilot study of extended-release naltrexone and harm-reduction counseling. At weeks 0 and 8, research staff provided a list of safer-drinking strategies for participants to endorse. Implementation of endorsed safer-drinking strategies was recorded at the next appointment. At both time points, strategies to buffer the effects of alcohol on the body (e.g., eating prior to and during drinking) were most highly endorsed, followed by changing the manner in which one drinks (e.g., spacing drinks), and reducing alcohol consumption. Quantitative analyses indicated that all participants endorsed safer-drinking strategies, and nearly all strategies were implemented (80-90% at weeks 0 and 8, respectively). These preliminary findings indicate that chronically homeless people with alcohol dependence use strategies to reduce harm associated with their drinking. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to test whether interventions that teach safer-drinking strategies may reduce overall alcohol-related harm in this population. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

AB  - This article reports results from two focus groups designed to understand perceptions of health and nature among adolescents living in emergency family shelters. Following institutional review board (IRB) approval, the authors conducted one focus group each at two emergency family shelters in a high-density suburb in the southern United States with a total of eight adolescents (ages 13-17; 100% African American; 3 males). The study followed the tenets of interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) in question design, data collection, and analysis. Four themes emerged from the data: (1) you are what you eat (2) healthy food is not always an option (3) physical activity makes you healthy, but it's hard in a shelter and (4) nature is an abstract ideal. The adolescents expressed a desire to lead healthy lives but were stymied by the built environment; they described nature in idyllic terms but rarely reported engaging in outdoor leisure activities. Findings offer preliminary evidence supporting the need to provide adolescents in family shelters with enhanced access to outdoor physical activity opportunities and fresh foods. Results also highlight the importance of future research into how the built environment contributes to physical and mental health disparities among adolescents in high poverty situations such as homelessness.

Case data on the attachment histories of Ss who were not responsive to stabilization showed significant differences on several measureable criteria from the histories of Ss who were responsive. The clinical & programmatic relevance of these findings is discussed. 1 Table, 19 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This article documents the living conditions of a sample of adolescents (N = 390) who had left home and were living on the street in Toronto, Canada The majority of these youth had spenta considerable amount of time without adequate shelter, food, or income; furthermore, many were involved in a variety of illegal activities and had been incarcerated or suicidal Multiple regression analyses revealed that the most consistent predictors of hunger, criminal activity, and incarceration were conditions of street life itself: thelack of secure shelter and the length of time on the street. Overal4 the living conditions of these youth closely parallel those of homeless adults. Although there are differences between adults and adolescents who live on the street, the similarities suggest that it may be inappropriate to label the latter runaways and to consistently separate adults and adolescents into two completely distinct homeless populations.

AB  -  Cross-national comparisons of homeless youth in Melbourne, Australia, and Los Angeles, CA, United States were conducted. Newly (n = 427) and experienced (n = 864) homeless youth were recruited from each site. Compared to Australia, homeless youth in the United States were younger, more likely to be in school or jail, demonstrated fewer sexual and substance use risk acts, fewer suicidal acts, and reported less need for social services. Across sites, experienced homeless youth were more likely to be older, male, engage in sexual and substance use, report greater need for social services, and make greater use of work, substance use, and health-related services. Homeless youth have different behavioral profiles in Australia and the United States, reflecting differences in the effectiveness of service systems in the two countries in keeping youth with fewer problems out of homelessness.

AB  - Surveillance data suggests that use of ecstasy in the U.S. is predominantly among white adolescent & young adults. To investigate ecstasy use among substance users in New York City we added questions to ongoing efforts to recruit heroin & cocaine users. Of 715 participants recruited, 58.3% were injection dug users (IDUs). The median age was 32 (range 17-64), 76.4% were male, 49.0% were currently homeless, 62.4% were Hispanic, 27.3% were black, & 34.5% were born outside the United States. Overall, 23.4% used ecstasy in their lifetime & 11.9% had used in the last-6 months. In multivariate logistic regression, correlates of lifetime ecstasy use included younger age, being born in the U.S., & current homelessness. We observed a significant interaction between injection drug use & race where, compared to black non-IDUs, Hispanic non-IDUs, & white IDUs were significantly more likely to have a history of lifetime ecstasy use while black IDUs were significantly less likely. These findings are limited to persons who use other drugs, but suggest that further investigation of ecstasy use in minority populations is warranted. Tables, References.

Of the sample, 37% had previously attempted suicide. The attempts were most commonly precipitated by trouble at home, arguments, disappointments, humiliations, trouble at school, assault, & sexual abuse. Of the respondents, 47% reported never having serious suicide ideation, while 12% reported suicide ideation 4+ times. Serious suicide ideation was strongly associated with desire to die. No ethnic or gender differences in risk factors were found. Suicide attempters significantly differed from nonattempters in current suicidal ideation, current plans for suicide, & depression. 1 Table, 35 References. D. Generoli

AB  - Few effective methods of intervention exist for youth at risk for negative life outcomes. One method used successfully with both adults with chronic mental illness and adults with substance abuse problems is strengths-based case management (SBCM). Based on the principles of strengths theory, SBCM aims to assist individuals in identifying and achieving personal goals, with an emphasis on the case manager-client relationship and client self-determination. In the current study, the authors report findings from a feasibility study that implemented SBCM with adolescent runaways. Challenges to implementation, such as financial status, the role of families, abuse and neglect, developmental issues, education, peer relationships, and transportation, are examined. The current findings suggest that it is feasible to successfully implement SBCM with adolescents, but the challenges to application are different with this group compared with adults, given the developmental differences between adolescents and adults.

AB  - Objective Little is known about the reproductive health or family planning needs of street-connected children and youth in resource-constrained countries. The study objective was to describe how street-connected children and youth (SCCY) in Eldoret, Kenya, perceive pregnancy.Methods This qualitative study was conducted between August 2013 and February 2014. A total of 65 SCCY aged 11–24 years were purposively sampled from the three referral points: 1) A dedicated study clinic for vulnerable children and youth at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH); 2) Primary locations in which street children reside known as “bases/barracks”; and 3) Street youth community-based organizations. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, and translated into English. Content analysis was performed after thematic coding by 4 independent coders.Results The majority of SCCY interviewed were male (69%) and sexually active (81.5%). None had gone beyond primary level of education. The strong desire for SCCY to go through conventional life experiences including marriage and child bearing was evident. Sub-themes around desired pregnancies included: sense of identity with other SCCY, sense of hope, male ego, lineage, source of income, and avoiding stigmatization. The desire for children was highly gendered with male SCCY more focused on their social status in the street community, while for females it was primarily for survival on the street. Female SCCY generally lacked agency around reproductive health issues and faced gender-based violence. Abortions (either assisted or self-induced), infanticide, and child abandonment were reported. Respondents described a lucrative market for babies born to SCCY and alleged that healthcare workers were known to abduct these babies following hospital deliveries.Conclusion Our findings indicate gender differences in the reasons why SCCY become pregnant and have children. We also noted gender inequalities in reproductive health decisions. SCCY friendly interventions that provide tailored reproductive health services are needed.

AB  - Drawing from case records of the first & largest runaway shelter program in the northeast US, 308 clients, seen between 1972 & 1976, were selected randomly for an analysis of runaway youth. The sample (134 Ms & 174 Fs) was reviewed & categorized according to nature of referral, referral source, & actions precipitating referral. Running away was defined as "leaving or staying away on purpose, knowing you would be missed, intending to stay away for at least some time." Only 30% of the youth met this definition. Two other categories emerged: (1) "castaways" (24%), who did not willingly leave home but were kicked out by their parents & later reported as runaways; & (2) "agency assist" (46%), reflecting assistance given to another agency in finding shelter for a child pending another action. Referral sources included the community, juvenile court, police departments, & agencies, in similar percentages for the "castaway" & "runaway" groups, but with some differences for the "agency assist" category. Circumstances preceding "runaway" episodes included status offenses, family breakdowns, curfew violations, & miscellaneous problems, while precipitating circumstances for "castaway" youth included family breakdowns, physical abuse, pregnancy, & miscellaneous. Events preceding referral for "agency assist" youth included family breakdowns, status offense, physical abuse, alcoholic parents, & miscellaneous problems. 4 Tables. Modified HA.

AB  - This study investigates family environments associated with depressive symptoms among male and female runaway adolescents. Data were collected on 197 participants recruited from a runaway youth shelter in the southwest. Regression analyses showed that females' depressive symptoms were predominately related to interpersonal relationships, such as family communication, conflict, and worry about these relationships. Male participants were particularly sensitive to father's alcohol abuse and worry about family relationships. Identifying family factors associated with depressive symptoms among male and female runaway youth has implications for treatment and reunification of adolescents with their families.

AB  - Purpose: Placement into foster care is driven by a number of factors, many of which are associated with adolescent childbirth. Yet, there are few studies that identify the experiences and characteristics that predict adolescent childbirth among girls who spend time in foster care. Methods: A longitudinal, population-based data set was constructed by probabilistically matching California child protective service records for female foster youth to maternal information available on vital birth records for children born between 2001 and 2010. Rates of childbirth among girls in foster care after their 10th birthday were generated. Chi-square tests assessed differences and survival models were specified to determine the rate of childbearing across key characteristics. Results: Among the 30,339 girls who spent time in foster care as adolescents, 18.3% (5,567) gave birth for the first time before their 20th birthday. At a bivariate level, significant differences (p < .001) in birth rates were observed across demographic characteristics, maltreatment history, and foster care placement experiences. In the fully adjusted survival model, the highest birth rates were observed among girls who entered care between ages 13 and 16 years; had been in care for relatively short periods of time; lived in congregate care at the estimated date of conception; had a history of running away; and were Latina, black, or Native American. Conclusions: The results suggest that there are identifiable risk factors associated with early childbirth among girls in foster care, which can help determine the timing and location of reproductive health services to minimize unintended pregnancy and maximize adolescent health and well-being.

AB  - The mental health and related quality of life of runaway adolescents are global public health issues. As few intervention studies have considered the family contexts of runaway adolescents, we aimed to develop an intervention tailored specifically to the needs of this population using an Intervention Mapping protocol. First, a literature review and interviews with runaway adolescents and youth shelter workers were conducted to create a logic model of the problem. Second, the behavioral and environmental outcomes were set to adapt to stressful situations and enable families to become more resourceful in dealing with family adversity, based on the results of needs assessment. Performance objectives and changeable determinants were also created by reviewing the pertinent theories and studies. Third, theory- and evidence-based methods to influence changes in the determinants were identified. Fourth, we designed an eight-session family-based mental health program incorporating individual and family approaches for runaway adolescents. Fifth, we determined that mental health nurses at community mental health centers linked to youth shelters would serve as the program implementers. Finally, we planned a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of our program on improving runaway adolescents’ mental health status and perceived family functioning.

AB  - This study explored the gender differences in sexual self-concept, personal resources for sexual health, safe sex behaviors, & risky sexual behaviors among homeless adolescents with & without histories of sexual abuse. Data for this secondary analysis were collected in 2003 to 2004 in the first phase of a larger repeated-measures sexual health intervention study; 371 homeless youth between 16 & 23 years of age (M = 19.26, SD = 1.83) were recruited from a street outreach center. The majority (64.6%) of participants were males. Self-report instruments were completed at the outreach center via audio computer-assisted self-interview (A-CASI) format. It was found that female participants were better off than males on numerous measures of sexual health behaviors & attitudes. Sexually abused participants had significantly less future time perspective (p = .05), fewer sexual self-care behaviors (p = .04), & less social support than nonabused participants (p = .01) & almost significantly more sexual risk-taking (p = .08). However, no significant differences were found between abused & nonabused participants on sexual self-concept, self-efficacy or intention to use condoms, safe sex behaviors, AIDS knowledge, assertive communication, or self-efficacy to perform testicular/ breast self-exams. Overall, participants who did not report a history of sexual abuse had significantly more sexual health resources & engaged in fewer sex-risk behaviors than those who reported having been abused. These differences have notable implications for screening adolescents for a history of sexual abuse. Adolescents who report sexual abuse should receive risk counseling & be screened regularly for the development of sexual risk behaviors. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This case study discusses two federal grant initiatives and the evaluation technical assistance (ETA) provided to the grantees. One program is a multiphase program funded by the Children’s Bureau (CB) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families. The program funded communities interested in preventing homelessness among youth and young adults with child welfare histories. The funder, grantees, and ETA provider call it Youth At-Risk of Homelessness (YARH). Six federal agencies—the U.S. Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Labor, the Corporation for National and Community Service, and the Institute for Museum and Library Services—supported the second initiative known as Performance Partnership Pilots for Disconnected Youth (P3). We discuss the programs together as they share common features including a focus on building evidence, a focus on disconnected youth, use of liaisons to work with grantees who are developing interventions and planning or conducting evaluations at the same time, and having the same liaisons provide ETA to both the grantee/service providing group and the local evaluator. The article discusses (1) the grant programs, (2) details about ETA including its funding and provision, (3) details about the success and utilization of ETA, (4) benefits of ETA, and (5) balancing program or initiative requirements and evaluation needs and concludes with (6) thoughts on how to make ETA successful.

AB  -  The high rates of substance use among American adolescents are challenging; however, runaway youth are at particularly high-risk for substance use. Runaway youth utilizing two service sectors, emergency crisis shelters and juvenile detention centers, were recruited to evaluate differences in risk factors associated with substance use. Findings demonstrate that youth admitted to juvenile detention (n = 121) had proportionally higher levels of problem behaviors, including substance use, than youth admitted to shelter services (n = 156). Both groups of youth have significantly higher levels of substance use than national estimates. The most significant risk factor for alcohol and marijuana use among youth in both groups was using other substances. Addressing issues of substance abuse among runaway youth must be a prime objective for future research and treatment for this high-risk population. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Introduction Our understanding of youths' sex trading predominantly stems from non-representative studies with high-risk populations (e.g. homeless/runaway youth). The purpose of this study is to identify the prevalence and associated characteristics of youth who report sex trading (compared to those who do not) in a representative sample of high school students. Methods Data comes from the 2018 Youth Assessment, a cross-sectional survey administered to 9th through 12th graders across 24 high schools in Dane County, a predominantly urban area in Wisconsin, U.S.A. All youth who answered the question, "have you ever had sexual contact in order to stay safe or to get something like a place to stay, money, gifts, alcohol or drugs?" were included for secondary data analysis (n = 13,714). Participants were 70% White, 50% female/47% male, and 90% minors. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results 2.47% of youth reported sex trading, of whom 91% were minors. Bivariate analysis revealed significant differences across demographics, economic instability, behavioral health and substance use, delinquency, and romantic/sexual behaviors. Multivariate results suggested that students who reported substance use, cutting class, 3 or more out-of-school suspensions, knowing a friend involved in a gang, dating violence, foster care involvement, or identifying as LGBTQ+ were more likely to report sex trading. Conclusions Although the causal order of characteristics analyzed in relation to the sex trading is not known, these findings have important implications for sex trading prevention, assessments, and intervention, particularly among youth with marginalized identities and adverse experiences.

AB  - Purpose Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) often engage in "couch-surfing," or frequently moving from one tenuous living arrangement to another. Understanding the characteristics and risk factors associated with couch-surfing is necessary to designing adequate responses to youth homelessness. The present study aims to investigate factors associated with youth at risk of couch-surfing or sleeping on the streets relative to staying in a shelter. Methods The present study used Homeless Management Information System administrative data sourced from 16 communities across the U.S. between January 2015 and February 2017 (n = 9,417). Multinomial logistic regression models were used to explore correlates (e.g., demographics, homeless histories, risk and victimization, behavioral health, and self-sufficiency) of couch-surfing or sleeping on the streets relative to staying in an emergency shelter program. Results YEH identifying as female; Black or another non-Latinx youth of color; or as lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning, or another sexual orientation (LGBQ+) were at greater risk of couch-surfing relative to staying in a shelter. YEH who threatened to harm themselves or others in the preceding 12 months or who attributed their homelessness to an abusive relationship were significantly more likely to either be couch-surfing or on the streets. Discussion Service providers must recognize and validate the vulnerabilities and risks experienced by couch-surfing YEH in order to help reduce barriers to accessing services faced by this population. Federal definitions of homelessness should be aligned to correct systemic biases and more accurately reflect the realities of how youth experience homelessness.

AB  -  Using cross-sectional analysis we examined residential status and associated differences in HIV risk behaviors among 3266 young IDUs enrolled in an HIV prevention trial. A three-level outcome (homeless (37%), equivocally housed (17%), housed (46%)) was defined based on responses to two questions assessing subjective and objective criteria for homelessness: "equivocally housed" participants were discordant on these measures. In multivariate analysis, antecedents of homelessness were having lived in an out-of-home placement, been thrown out of the home or in juvenile detention, and experienced childhood abuse; while correlates included receiving income from other and illegal sources, drinking alcohol or using methamphetamine at least daily, using shooting galleries, backloading, and sex work. A subset of these variables was associated with being equivocally housed. HIV risk varies by housing status, with homeless IDUs at highest risk. Programs for IDUs should utilize a more specific definition of residential status to target IDUs needing intervention. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Purpose: Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior compared to cisgender youth and subsequently experience poorer health outcomes. Yet scarce research has described TGD youth's unique experiences related to sexuality specific protective factors, including communication about sexual health. This qualitative study aims to explore TGD young people's experiences with parent-youth communication about sexuality. Methods: Responding to fliers posted online and in community spaces, eight TGD young people (ages= 16-23 years) were enrolled. This study intentionally sampled youth of minority race or ethnicity (50%) and those with lifetime experiences of homelessness (25%). Following a semi-structured interview guide, questions focused on family communication about sexuality, sexual health, and relationships. Interviews lasted 50 to 79 minutes (mean=66 minutes), and participants received a $50 gift card in appreciation of their time. Audio recordings were professionally transcribed. De-identified transcripts were structurally coded allowing for data related to parent-youth interaction to be sorted into a single file. Data related to youth-parent interaction were then coded inductively, individually by two coders and code lists were generated. Coders met to reconcile code list differences, discuss other discrepancies, and sort codes into distinct themes. Results: Three themes emerged from the data: (1) what my parents taught me; (2) what I taught my parents; and (3) what I wish my parents taught me. In the first theme, youth described parent-led communication about sexuality including what content was discussed, the medium used for these discussions, and perceptions about the timing of communication. For instance, Aiden detailed a conversation he had with his dad, "Oh, he would legitimately just be like, 'sperm goes into an egg, and when a woman's ovulating, then she can be pregnant, and then this is what happens when you become pregnant/ It was really only just the scientific aspects of it, and also probably a lot of misinformation." In the second theme, youth discussed youth-led communication with parents about sexuality. For instance, Lucy described a conversation with her mother, 'The [conversations] I'm thinking about have been recent, like telling her about...the effect of [hormone therapy] on my body sexually." In the third theme, youth identified what they wish their parents had understood and communicated to them about sexuality. For instance, Riker described, "I wish I had been able to have some kind of conversations with my mom, alongside my hormone provider, where they were telling me the facts of things, but then having that kind of long-term conversation with my mom." Conclusions: Communication about sexuality between TGD youth and their parents created a foundation of understanding for some youth but was characterized by significant gaps. However, TGD youth were active participants in these conversations, sometimes leading the discussions and sometimes reflecting on gaps in the conversation. Health care providers can support these conversations by guiding parents to accurate and inclusive resources; dispelling myths and correcting misinformation; and providing space for provider-facilitated conversations about TGD-specific sexual health considerations, such as long-term impact of hormone care on reproduction.

AB  - Previous research indicates a positive link between youth runaway episodes and the likelihood of homelessness in later adolescence and early adulthood. An adolescent's decision to run away from home often accompanies depressive symptomology compared with stably housed youth. The present study used a large, nationally representative sample of 8,560 youth to identify links among runaway behavior, changes in depressive symptomology during the transition from adolescence to emerging adulthood, and homelessness. Results suggest that running away during adolescence is linked with later homelessness across depressive symptom classes. In fact, even a single runaway episode as a teenager tripled the odds of reporting homelessness by young adulthood. However, the magnitude of the association varies based on depressive symptom trajectories. Adolescents reporting high levels of depressive symptomology that increased over time were 6 times more likely to experience homelessness, compared with youth with consistently low depressive symptoms. Interestingly, among participants who reported never running away, this same high/increasing depressive symptoms group were less likely to report homelessness than were peers with consistently low depressive symptoms. These findings point to a potential resiliency process among youth in this category that needs to be further explored to identify differences in youth with poor mental health who leave home verses those who remain stably housed.

AB  - Runaway youth report a broader range & higher severity of substance-related, mental health & family problems relative to non-runaway youth. Most studies to date have collected self-report data on the family & social history; virtually no research has examined treatment effectiveness with this population. This study is a treatment development project in which 124 runaway youth were randomly assigned to (1) ecologically based family therapy (EBFT) or (2) service as usual (SAU) through a shelter. Youth completed an intake, posttreatment, 6 & 12 months follow-up assessment. Youth assigned to EBFT reported greater reductions in overall substance abuse compared to youth assigned to SAU while other problem areas improved in both conditions. Findings suggest that EBFT is an efficacious intervention for this relatively severe population of youth. 6 Tables, 3 Figures, 68 References.

AB  - This seminal study from Turkey investigates sexual abuse (SA) victimization, psychological symptoms, and hopelessness in female adolescents with runaway behavior. A total of 76 female adolescent participants aged 15–18 completed the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). Among these adolescents, 63.1% (n = 48) were victims of SA, 61.8% (n = 47) had a Global Severity Index (GSI) T-score of 63 or above, and 68.4% (n = 52) had moderate–severe hopelessness. Although there was no significant difference, the SA rate was higher in those who had experienced SA before running away. ‘Intrafamilial relationship problems’ and ‘SA-related factors’ were the most frequently reported reasons for runaway behavior. Victims of SA had significantly higher scores in all BSI subdimensions and global symptom severity than those previously not SA victims. The results suggest that high levels of psychological symptoms, hopelessness, history of SA, and poor parent–child relationships are possible factors that can describe female adolescents who have run away from home. Psychosocial prevention programs involving adolescents and parents are needed to prevent at-risk female adolescents from running away from home.

AB  - A growing body of research has examined street youth within the context of developed countries, focusing primarily on urban centers. This research is broad in scope and multidisciplinary in perspective (e.g., Baron, 2004; Hagan & McCarthy, 1997; Karabanow, 2004; Webber, 1991). In recent years, research from the developing world has also examined the problem of street youth. Studies from South and Central America (Inciardi & Surratt, 1998; Lusk, 1992; Rizzini and Lusk, 1995) and Africa (Ennew, 2003; Lalor, 1999) have documented the plight of these marginalized youth. What is missing in the research literature, however, is a systematic analytic comparison between street youth living in a developed versus a developing, world context. Given the fact the economies of the world are increasingly becoming integrated through globalization, there may be reason to believe some of the processes contributing to youth homelessness, and responses to the problem, could be similar in scope in both settings, Such questions as these then arise: Who are the youth working the streets in developed versus developing countries? What are their backgrounds? What sorts of economic activities are these young people engaged in? What is the nature of their living conditions? How are these youth regarded by their respective societies? This paper addresses these questions with a keen awareness of the distinct cultural and economic differences that exist between Toronto, Canada; Quito, Ecuador; and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

AB  - Purpose: Violence is a serious public health issue with myriad short-and long-term impacts on development and health outcomes. Violence victimization can present as many typologies (e.g.., physical, psychological, sexual) and from different perpetrators (e.g., intimate partners, parents, peers). The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and typologies of violence victimization among an online recruited sample of sexually active adolescent substance users in southern metropolitan areas. Methods: This study aimed to recruit adolescents aged 13-17 years who reported being sexually active, having a history of substance use, and residing in one of five Southern metropolitan areas with high HIV incidence (Atlanta, GA; Columbia, SC; Jackson, MS; Jacksonville, FL; Memphis TN). Respondents were recruited online from January to March 2019 through social networking platforms, and 101 eligible adolescents were enrolled. The average age at baseline was 16.3 (SD=0.9) years. Results: At baseline, 65.3% (n=66) of adolescents reported prior victimization of at least one typology (physical, verbal, emotional, sexual, and neglect). Verbal (53.5%, n=54) and emotional (48.5%, n=49) abuse were the most commonly reported, followed by physical abuse (20.8%, n=21), sexual abuse (16.8%, n=17), and neglect (10.9%, n=ll). The majority of respondents (72.7%, n=48) reported experiencing more than one type of victimization. Specific to intimate partner violence (IPV), 29.7% (n=30) of respondents reported prior victimization. The most common form of IPV experienced was sexual coercion (26.7%, n=27) followed by sexual assault/rape (13.9%, n=14) and physical violence (9.9%, n=10). Eleven (10.9%) respondents indicated their first sexual experience was by force or without consent. Differences in violence victimization were observed by respondents' demographic characteristics. Biological females more frequently reported experiences of emotional abuse (p=.002), sexual abuse (p=.048), sexual coercion from a partner (p=.047), and any form of IPV (p=.048) as compared to biological males. Sexual and gender minority (SGM) adolescents more frequently reported verbal abuse (p=.036), sexual coercion from a partner (p=.035), and any form of IPV (p =.013) as compared to non-SGM adolescents. Adolescents with prior experiences of homelessness more frequently reported physical abuse (p=.005), verbal abuse (p=.005), emotional abuse (p=.018), and neglect (p=.003) as compared to adolescents with stable housing. Conclusions: Experiences of violence victimization were pervasive among this sample of high-risk adolescents. SGM adolescents and adolescents with experiences of homelessness disproportionately reported prior victimization, similar to other studies showing a greater burden of victimization among females, SGM, and other vulnerable youth. Public health and medicine professionals should increase efforts to discuss violence prevention, reporting, and resources with young people at an early age, especially more vulnerable children and young people. In line with findings from this study showing that adolescents prefer online and technology-based modalities for interventions and service delivery, innovative prevention interventions and communication campaigns are also needed to address and prevent violence victimization, particularly IPV, among adolescents via commonly used digital channels and platforms. Sources of Support: This study was supported by the ARCS Foundation Atlanta Chapter.

AB  - Interview data from a convenience sample of 414 adolescents who resided with rural families on Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in 10 AR counties are used to determine what demographic & theoretical factors from control, strain, & social learning theories predicted sexual intercourse in the past year & lifetime sexual partners among young & older adolescents (ages 13-15 & 16-17, respectively). Together, the findings offer partial support for the conceptual framework of development undergirding the study that elements of control or bonding & use of excuses are important influences on sexual behavior of older adolescents, whereas young adolescents are more influenced by differential peer association, including use of excuses, & a deep-seated need for love or attachment. Furthermore, the finding that friend support actually increases the likelihood of sexual partners among young adolescents may be another manifestation of their need for closeness. Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed. 5 Tables, 80 References. Adapted from the source document.

Le premier volet de cette étude identifie les caractéristiques des jeunes hébergés dans un centre de réadaptation et dans un foyer de groupe (n = 148). Les résultats démontrent des fréquences élevées de jeunes qui présentent un trouble déficitaire de l'attention avec ou sans hyperactivité (TDAH), un problème de santé mentale et qui prennent une médication. Des analyses comparatives selon le genre révèlent que les garçons présentent davantage de problèmes de comportement tels que la violence, la consommation, et la délinquance, alors que la victimisation est plus présente chez les filles. Le second volet repose sur une analyse des besoins, conduite auprès des jeunes hébergés (n = 80), en plus de sonder les adultes impliqués auprès d'eux (n = 141). Cette analyse révèle que les besoins identifiés varient selon le type de répondants mais se situent surtout dans les sphères de vie suivantes : santé mentale, autonomie des jeunes et transition à la vie adulte, marché du travail, perception de soi, relations familiales. Ces besoins sont d'ailleurs en concordance avec les problématiques vécues par les jeunes.

AB  - BackgroundChild homelessness has been associated with elevated mental health problems during early adolescence, a period of onset for psychiatric problems. Prior literature has relied on cross-sectional studies, limiting the understanding of temporality and trajectories of psychopathology. We extend prior literature by examining associations between child homelessness and internalising and externalising symptom trajectories in early adolescence, with consideration of timing and persistence of homelessness.MethodsUsing population-based longitudinal data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we used multilevel models to examine the effects of homelessness prior to age 9, the timing of homelessness (eg, early vs middle childhood) and cumulative exposure to homelessness on internalising and externalising trajectories across ages <0–9 years. We also tested for sex differences in these associations.ResultsOf the 8391 participants, 5.5% reported exposure to homelessness at least once before age 9. Children who experienced homelessness had elevated internalising and externalising symptoms compared with their consistently housed peers, with excess risk evident among children who first experienced homelessness in middle childhood (relative to early childhood) and children who experienced recurrent homelessness. We did not observe changes in symptom trajectories over the course of 4 years. Men who experienced homelessness displayed a more pronounced risk of internalising symptoms relative to women and men who did not experience homelessness.ConclusionChildhood homelessness is associated with persistently elevated internalising and externalising symptoms across early adolescence compared with their consistently housed peers. Interventions and policies to address family homelessness may lead to better mental health among adolescents.

AB  - The link between youth homelessness and mental health functioning was examined using state population-representative 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data. The moderating role of victimization and perceived teacher support also was examined. Consistent with hypotheses, results indicated that homelessness was associated with greater mental health challenges, more victimization, and less teacher support. The association between homelessness and mental health was not moderated by perceived teacher support. However, victimization experiences served as a moderator such that more victimization exacerbated the effect of homelessness on mental health challenges. This study supports the utility of the YRBS for gaining understanding of the experiences and needs of youth experiencing homelessness and adds to the growing literature on predictors of individual differences in mental health functioning of these vulnerable youth.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Drug Prevention in Youth risk reduction program that was implemented in shelters for runaway/homeless youths in the Southeastern United States. The program focuses on knowledge, attitudes and skills that can help this group of high risk young people minimize the serious negative consequences of drug abuse. An evaluation strategy was developed so comparisons could be made between peer-led, adult-led and non-intervention groups. Dependent samples t tests and least squares ANCOVAS were used to measure pretest-posttest differences both within and between groups. Results indicate that the peer-led groups were more successful than the other two groups, and that program effects were the most powerful with the youngest group of shelter clients. Process evaluation revealed important factors related to group leader training and group management. It is concluded that well-trained and motivated peer/near peer leaders have particularly valuable contributions to make with regard to drug abuse risk reduction for shelter clients.

AB  - Adolescents in low‐income, marginalized families are vulnerable to behavior problems that impede healthy functioning and threaten long‐term well‐being. Informal supports may fill an important gap for these households as they navigate financial and social stressors. Instrumental support from social networks and neighborhood cohesion may promote family stability and youth well‐being; further, these informal supports may promote resilience to housing insecurity, which is linked with a range of adverse adolescent outcomes. The present study utilized data from a large sample of at‐risk families with children (N = 2425) to investigate whether instrumental support and neighborhood cohesion predicted adolescent behavior problems over 10 years and whether these links were mediated by housing insecurity. Results of structural equation modeling with latent variables showed direct links from instrumental support to anxious/depressed behaviors and from neighborhood cohesion to aggressive behaviors, as well as an indirect link from instrumental support to aggressive behavior via housing insecurity. Findings suggest informal supports are an important source of resilience for low‐income families who may be excluded from or are reluctant to engage with formal social systems. Further, stable, connected communities with highly embedded social networks can promote housing stability and youth well‐being in a virtuous cycle.

The finding shows that there has been a continual increase in the number of articles on runaway and homeless youth issues over the last decade in both countries. The result of the analysis by content categories indicates American articles have explored more diverse topics and have focused on addressing the problems, while South Korean articles have focused on understanding the causes of becoming a runaway and offering service provision. The analysis of sampling frames shows American articles have mainly used 'street youth sampling,' whereas South Korean articles have utilized 'shelter youth sampling'. The result of analysis by research methods indicates that 'descriptive design' is the most shared common research method across the two countries. These findings highlight the differences between research trends of the two countries. Implications for future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Children of color are over-represented in the child welfare system. Research suggests that disproportionality is predominately attributable to the resource poor environments in which these children are raised. However, it is important to understand whether the child welfare system is able to diminish these societal level inequities, and consequently disproportionality, by reducing racial/ethnic disparities in outcomes of youth exiting state care. Encouragingly, research in this area has found few racial/ethnic differences in the outcomes of former foster youth. However, these studies are regional and have not investigated outcomes for a broad array of racial/ethnic groups. To fill this gap, the present study uses the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) to examine educational attainment, employment, homelessness, and incarceration for white, African-American, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native emancipated youth. Results reveal that African-American youth are less likely to be employed and more likely to report incarceration than white youth. However, African-American youth were 36% more likely to enroll in higher education than white youth and there were no significant differences in outcomes between white and Hispanic youth. However, AI/AN youth exhibited no advantages and significant disadvantages relative to youth from other racial/ethnic groups. Results suggest that child welfare services and state supports for youth exiting care can contribute to improved outcomes and racial/ethnic parity. However, additional effort is needed to reduce poor outcomes, particularly for American Indian/Alaska Native youth.

AB  - This article seeks to increase the number of high-risk & homeless youth who receive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test results & posttest counseling. Oral HIV testing & counseling were offered to high-risk & homeless youth at sites at which youth congregate throughout Portland, OR. Subjects were randomized to receive test results & posttest counseling either in either a face-to-face manner or via telephone notification. Self-reported demographic & risk-behavior information was collected prior to HIV testing. Among the 351 youth who were tested, 48% followed up to receive test results & posttest counseling. Adolescents most likely to receive their results were female, older (19-24 years), & white & those who reported high-risk behaviors. Those given the option of telephone notification were significantly more likely to receive their results than those required to have face-to-face notification (odds ratio = 2.301, 95% confidence interval of 1.499, 3.534). This was true regardless of age, race, history of previous HIV testing, or presence of high-risk behaviors. Two youths tested positive for HIV corroborating previous reports of low HIV prevalence in this population. Both were assigned to the face-to-face notification group &, therefore, no HIV positive results were given by telephone. The option of telephone notification significantly increased the proportion of youth who received posttest counseling & results following community-based testing. 1 Table, 22 References.

AB  - Though few studies exist on service utilization among homeless youth in the U.S., services are important because without them, many of these young people may resort to delinquent strategies in order to meet their daily survival needs. The current study examines frequency and correlates of service utilization (i.e., shelters, food programs, street outreach, counseling, STI and HIV testing) among a sample of 249 homeless youth ages 14 to 21. Multivariate analysis revealed significant differences in service usage by sex, age, and sexual orientation. Experiencing family physical and/or sexual abuse, being kicked out of the family home, spending more nights per week sleeping on the street, and having ever stayed in a group home facility were significant correlates of homeless youths' service usage.

AB  - Emergency shelters are a core component of homeless service systems that address immediate basic needs. Service bans, which refer to temporary or permanent disallowances from a program or organization, are an underresearched phenomenon that can leave people experiencing homelessness without needed supports. This exploratory study examined the factors associated with shelter bans among people experiencing homelessness using secondary data from two Canadian studies: (1) a multisite randomized controlled trial of Housing First (At Home/Chez Soi Demonstration Project) and (2) a cross-sectional survey of youth experiencing homelessness across Canada (2019 Without a Home–National Youth Homelessness Survey). The two datasets were analyzed separately using logistic regression models with similar predictors to maximize the comparability of the results. Participants who experienced homelessness at an earlier age and had recent criminal justice system involvement were more likely to have shelter bans in both datasets. Impaired impulse control, more chronic medical conditions and living in Toronto were associated with increased likelihood of shelter bans in the At Home/Chez Soi dataset, whereas more adverse childhood experiences, physical violence victimization, engagement in survival sex behaviours and longer current episodes of homelessness were significant predictors of bans in the Without A Home dataset. Overall, the findings suggest that victimization and criminalization during homelessness may increase the risk of shelter loss from bans and further exclusion. The observed regional differences also highlight the potential limits of individual-level predictors. Further research is needed on shelter ban outcomes, as well as how capacity limits and organizational policies affect banning decisions.

The HOMES program is an example of a health care delivery model that addresses the complex and unique health care needs of individual who are homeless.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess item characteristics indicative of the severity of risk for commercial sexual exploitation among a high-risk population of child welfare system involved youth to inform the construction of a screening tool. Existing studies have discerned factors that differentiate Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) victims from sexual abuse victims, yet no research has been conducted to discriminate which items in a high risk population of youth are most predictive of CSEC. Using the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW) cohorts I and II, we examined responses from 1063 males and 1355 females ages 11 and older, over three interview periods. A 2-parameter logistic Item Response Theory (2 PL IRT) model was employed in order to examine item performance as potential indicators for the severity of risk for CSEC. Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis was conducted in order to examine potential differences in item responses based on gender. Modeling strategies to assess item difficulty and discrimination were outlined and Item Characteristic Curves for the final retained items were presented. Evidence for uniform DIF were present within items that asked about runaway, any drug use, suicidality, and experiencing severe violence. Results from this study can inform the construction of a screening instrument to assess the severity of risk for experiencing CSEC.

AB  - Identifying age, period, and cohort trends in perceived mental health treatment need over time by mental illness severity is important to identify where to focus early intervention efforts. We included adults who did not report receiving past-year mental health treatment in the 2008–2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N = 364,676). Hierarchical age-period-cohort models were used to assess perceived mental health treatment need, adjusting for demographics stratified by mental illness severity (none, any but not severe [AMI], severe [SMI]). Median odds ratios estimated cohort and period variance. Cohort effects explained a significant portion of the variance over time; period effects were minimal. Perceived mental health treatment need was highest among adults with AMI from recent birth cohorts (2000–2002: β = 1.12; 95% CI = 0.96, 1.28). Efforts are needed to address increases in perceived mental health treatment need in younger birth cohorts, such as removing structural barriers (e.g., healthcare system barriers).

AB  - Homeless youth who identity as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer (LGBTQ) face considerable issues including victimization, mental health needs, and substance use, yet are less likely than their heterosexual homeless peers to utilize services. Although research in this area is growing, studies tend to focus on the experiences and service use of homeless youth in drop-in or emergency shelters, instead of longer-term transitional living programs (TLPs). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to expand the homeless youth literature by examining differences in sociodemographic characteristics, victimization, mental health, and substance use histories, and service utilization patterns of homeless youth by LGBQ identity (LGBQ vs. non-LGBQ) in a TLP. We extracted secondary data from closed case files of homeless youth (N = 101) ages 16–20 who accessed services in a mid-Michigan TLP between 2011 and 2018. Using independent sample t-tests and Chi-square, we assessed patterns by LGBQ. Results indicate that LGBQ homeless youth were more likely than their non-LGBQ homeless peers to identify as female, report being sexually victimized, and have greater mental health-related needs. All youth, but especially LGBQ youth underutilized available services, resulting in greater unmet mental health needs. These findings confirm the vulnerability of LGBQ homeless youth in TLPs and provide essential information regarding service utilization for homeless youth practitioners, including the need for trauma-informed and LGBTQ-specific services. Additionally, the data suggest that service providers must encourage youth engagement in services offered within TLPs.

AB  - Homeless youth experience high rates of suicidal ideation and attempts, yet limited research has examined predictors of treatment engagement among this population. Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) between the ages of 18 and 24 years were recruited from a drop-in center in Columbus, Ohio. Participants were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention + treatment as usual through a local drop-in center (CTSP + TAU) (N = 75) or TAU alone (N = 75), and treatment attendance among those assigned to CTSP + TAU was examined in this study. As expected, among youth engaged in CTSP + TAU, those with a history of intimate partner violence (IPV) showed decreased odds of treatment attendance. Additionally, youth randomized into CTSP + TAU with higher acquired capability for suicide (ACS) scores and those identifying as Black were more likely to attend treatment sessions. Findings suggest that effective treatment implementation must consider youth’s trauma history, demographics and severity of suicidal ideation and behaviors.

AB  - Recreational cocaine use spread rapidly in Amsterdam, Netherlands, at the end of the 1970s, particularly as a "party drug" in clubs & discotheques. At the end of the 1980s, the role of cocaine as party drug was largely taken over by ecstasy. In contrast, first cocaine & then crack cocaine increased in popularity among heroin addicts & marginalized street youth, including the homeless & prostitutes. Today, experimental use of crack is also observed among young people from socially deprived neighborhoods, especially among ethnic minorities. Here, drawing mainly on ethnographic studies among these groups, the evolving & diverging patterns of use among trend-setting party youth & their marginalized counterparts are described. Important differences may be observed between groups related to socioeconomic background, the role cocaine plays in their lives, transmission routes, & different operating market mechanisms influenced by drug policy. For party youth, cocaine use mainly serves recreational purposes. In contrast, for problem youth, cocaine, & now especially crack, contribute to multiproblem behavior within the context of their marginalized lifestyles. 5 Tables, 2 Figures, 39 References.

AB  - Introduction Research indicates that sexual and romantic relationships play an important role in youth well-being and development. This strengths-based perspective sits in tension with the documented risks that youth with histories of maltreatment face in sexual/romantic relationships. We conducted a U.S.-based mixed-method study to examine the connection between childhood maltreatment and youth relationships. Method We collected retrospective ratings of relationship quality and open-ended comments about those relationships using an online sexual life history calendar. Quantitative analyses drew on data from 98 participants (51 cisgender women, 47 cisgender men) between the ages of 18–25 (Mage = 22.51). Qualitative analyses compared demographically matched subsamples of 19 participants who reported multiple forms of child maltreatment and 20 who reported none. Results Quantitative analyses indicated that ratings of relationship stability, intimacy, and pleasure were unrelated to prior abuse or neglect. Qualitative analyses showed the relationships of those with multiple maltreatment histories, compared to those without any maltreatment, to be more often intertwined with and complicated by other hardships (e.g., homelessness). Conclusions Quantitatively, childhood maltreatment appeared unrelated to youth sexual/romantic relationship quality, though we regard those findings with due caution. Complementing this was qualitative evidence of differences between participants based on trauma histories, with those who had experienced childhood maltreatment referring more often to surrounding circumstances and hardships in descriptions of their youth sexual/romantic relationships. These mixed method findings reinforce the importance of youth sexuality research, policy, and practice that takes the broader conditions of young people's lives into consideration.

AB  - Cisgender lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer/questioning (LGBQ) homeless youths are more likely to engage in sexual risk behaviors relative to cisgender heterosexual homeless youths. Homeless youths (N = 1,046) were recruited and surveyed from three drop-in centers in Los Angeles, California. This study assessed differences in demographics, background experiences, and perceived social network norms in order to understand the disparities in rates of unprotected sex and concurrent sex between these two subgroups. Results indicate significant differences in engagement in risk factors as well as social network norms. Findings provide support for tailored sexual risk-reduction interventions that cater specifically to LGBQ homeless youths.

Newly (n = 427) & experienced (n = 864) homeless youth were recruited from each site. Compared to Australia, homeless youth in the United States were younger, more likely to be in school or jail, demonstrated fewer sexual & substance use risk acts, fewer suicidal acts, & reported less need for social services. Across sites, experienced homeless youth were more likely to be older, male, engage in sexual & substance use, report greater need for social services, & make greater use of work, substance use, & health-related services. Homeless youth have different behavioral profiles in Australia & the United States, reflecting differences in the effectiveness of service systems in the two countries in keeping youth with fewer problems out of homelessness.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the domestic care environment on the prevalence of potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among orphaned and separated children in Uasin Gishu County, western Kenya.Methods A total of 1565 (55.5% male) orphaned and separated adolescents aged 10–18 years (mean 13.8 years, sd 2.2), were assessed for PTSD and PTEs including bullying, physical abuse and sexual abuse. In this sample, 746 lived in extended family households, 746 in Charitable Children's Institutions (CCIs), and 73 on the street. Posttraumatic stress symptom (PTSS) scores and PTSD were assessed using the Child PTSD Checklist.Results Bullying was the commonest PTE in all domestic care environments, followed by physical and sexual abuse. All PTEs were commonest among the street youth followed by CCIs. However, sexual abuse was more prevalent in households than in CCIs. Prevalence of PTSD was highest among street youth (28.8%), then households (15.0%) and CCIs (11.5%). PTSS scores were also highest among street youth, followed by CCIs and households. Bullying was associated with higher PTSS scores and PTSD odds than either sexual or physical abuse.Conclusion This study demonstrated differences in distribution of trauma and PTSD among orphaned and separated children in different domestic care environments, with street youth suffering more than those in CCIs or households. Interventions are needed to address bullying and sexual abuse, especially in extended family households. Street youth, a heretofore neglected population, are urgently in need of dedicated mental health services and support.

AB  - Sexual minority (SM) youth have twice the risk of experiencing homelessness compared to their heterosexual peers. Further, SM youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) report greater depression symptoms and substance use compared to heterosexual YEH. Housing First is an intervention that provides scattered-site individual apartments, without any prerequisite conditions for eligibility, and additional services to support long-term housing sustainment; however, few studies have examined the effectiveness of this approach for SM youth. The current study utilized data from a RCT that provided housing to young mothers experiencing homelessness to examine if treatment effects varied by mothers' sexual identity. Mothers were randomly assigned to services as usual (i.e., provided a referral sheet of all services available in the community; SAU), Housing only (i.e., three months of utility and rental assistance; Housing), or housing and supportive services (integrates independent housing, Strengths-Based Outreach and Advocacy (SBOA), HIV prevention, and substance use/mental health counseling; Housing + SS). Latent growth curve models were estimated to assess how substance use and depression symptoms changed over the 12 months. SM mothers receiving SAU or Housing did not experience a significant change in substance use or depression symptoms. All groups of heterosexual mothers and SM mothers receiving Housing + SS had less substance use and depression symptoms at twelve months, with SM mothers in Housing + SS evidencing a steeper decline in substance use and depression symptoms. This study provides some of the first evidence that Housing First can mitigate the mental health and substance use concerns of SM YEH. Given SM's higher rates of homelessness, substance use, and depression symptoms, Housing First should be further explored as an intervention to address their unique needs.

AB  - Teens who experience homelessness are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior, though less is reliably known about sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing rates in this group. We tested for differences in sexual behaviors and STI/HIV testing based on student homelessness and intersecting factors using data from the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey administered in 7 states and 3 school districts. Students who experienced homelessness were more likely to report risky sexual behavior. Race moderated this link, suggesting that Asian students who experienced homelessness were at greater risk. Homelessness was linked to a greater likelihood of having been tested for STIs/HIV among those who seemed to be in groups recommended for testing. Student sex and lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) identity did not moderate associations between homelessness and risky sexual behavior or STI/HIV testing. The overall sample demonstrated low STI testing rates, indicating a continued need to improve testing rates for all youth at risk for STIs/HIV.

AB  - HIV researchers use short messaging service (SMS)-based surveys to monitor health behaviors more closely than what would be possible with in-person assessment. Benefits are tempered by nonresponse to completing surveys. Understanding response patterns and their associated study participant characteristics would guide more tailored use of SMS-based surveys for HIV studies. We examined response to weekly 7-item SMS surveys administered as part of an HIV prevention trial. Using Mixture hidden Markov models (MHMM), we identified the underlying response patterns shared by subgroups of participants over time and quantified the association between these response patterns and participant characteristics. Three underlying response patterns were identified; responders, responders with phone-related errors, and non-responders. Non-responders versus responders were more likely to be younger, male, cis-gender, Black and Latinx participants with histories of homelessness, incarceration, and social support service utilization. Responders with phone-related errors compared to non-responders were more likely to be Black, Latinx, female, students, and have a history of incarceration and social support service utilization. More nuanced results from MHMM analyses better inform what strategies to use for increasing SMS response rates, including assisting in securing phone ownership/service for responders with phone-related errors and identifying alternative strategies for non-responders. Actively collecting and monitoring non-delivery notification data available from SMS gateway service companies offers another opportunity to identify and connect with participants when they are willing but unable to respond during follow-up.

AB  - The handling of status offenders is reviewed in the context of the historical development of juvenile justice in this country. Discrepancies between the legal code and the actual practice are noted and discussed in the light of present tendencies and likely developments concerning status offenders. On the basis of a nationally representative sample of 1467 juvenile offenders a procedure is developed to estimate the actual number of status offenders committed to public correctional facilities in the nation as a whole and in the 48 contiguous states. These estimates are correlated with a battery of socio-demographic factors. The analysis suggests that the phenomenon of status offenders is mainly a problem of the modern way of life characterized by urbanization, industrialization, and affluence. Some policy recommendations are the natural result of the present analysis.The noble intention of the justice system to exempt minors from the full force of criminal law ironically has resulted in one of the worst legal situations on record (Platt, 1969; Mattick and Aikman, 1969; Sarri, 1974). In 1899 Illinois became the first state to enact a juvenile court act, and within thirty years all but two states had followed suit by drafting special juvenile statutes designed to eliminate formal procedures and stigmatizing labels for minors and to emphasize individual treatment on the basis of parens patriae ideologies. Since the juvenile justice system was intended strictly for the protection and well-being of the youth, neither procedural guidelines nor jurisdictional boundaries were thought necessary for inclusion in juvenile statutes (Levin and Sarri, 1974). The lack of such regulations as well as extensive misconceptions of the goals of the reformers have resulted in a most tragic overreach by the juvenile justice system: the presumed or actual possession of jurisdiction over status offenders (Lemert, 1970). A status offender is commonly defined as a minor who engages in conduct which would not result in a criminal charge if committed by an adult. Typical examples of such conduct are "truancy", "running away", "using profanity", "growing up in idleness", and "incorrigibility". These examples make clear that status offenses refer to both violation of specific ordinances and to general character or personality shortcomings and disorders. The indiscriminate handling of status offenders thus not only offends our sense of justice but also invites serious questioning of the efficacy of the present approach to cope with status offenders. In short, an institution designed to protect the most vulnerable population -- the nation's youth, that is -- has turned into a formal procedure by the system in which "the child is least helped and most abused" (Orlando, 1975). The failure to distinguish between status offenses and violations of penal laws by minors has resulted in jammed pretrial detention centers, inadequate and perfunctory court processing, and oversized correctional facilities crowded with status offenders and serious delinquents (including murderers) together. Thus immeasurable damage is inflicted upon youth at an absolutely forbidding cost to society at large. For these reasons the handling of status offenders should be removed from the juvenile justice system and be entrusted to a special service organization which does not have judicial power over its clients. Recent Supreme Court decisions have begun to move in this direction,1 but few states thus far have successfully incorporated this development into the juvenile statutes, and no state has fully implemented the rulings issued by the highest court in this land.In this paper an attempt is made (1) to review the statutory distinctions and disposition differences concerning status offenders and juvenile delinquents, (2) to estimate the number of detained status offenders as a percentage of all the youth committed to public correctional facilities,2 and (3) to examine some structural correlates of the forty-eight contiguous states which might explain the differences in the proportion of status offenders detained in public correctional facilities.

AB  - Among LGBTQ youth, suicidality and homelessness occur at heightened rates. Using the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS), this study seeks to explore the associations of having a parent, family member, friend, or romantic partner in one’s social network and not being “out” to specific network members (lack of disclosure) with ITS constructs (perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belonging), considering homelessness history. Data include 462 youth aged 12–24 who contacted an LGBTQ youth-focused suicide crisis provider from 2015 to 2017. Disclosure status and network composition differed by homelessness experience. Homeless youth were more likely to disclose to their parents and less likely to disclose to other family members. Youth who had not disclosed to their parents reported higher perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belonging whereas having more family members and peers in one’s network was associated with lower scores on ITS constructs. Implications for prevention approaches with youth who may be at increased risk for suicide are discussed.

AB  - This article links the development of service user involvement championed in the United Kingdom to two examples in Dutch-speaking qualifying social work programmes: one from Belgium and one from the Netherlands. In both projects, a longer lasting cooperation with more marginalised service users was established. The Belgium project highlights social work lecturers and service users living in poverty, working in tandem to deliver a module to social work and socio-educational care work students. The example from the Netherlands involves young people from a homeless shelter as peer-researchers, working together with social work students.Both projects, one focusing on social work education and on social work research, highlight striking similarities in the positives and challenges of working with service users including how this challenges both groups preconceptions of the other, deepens learning but also creates greater potential for confrontations which need to be managed creatively. The article also identifies the pre-requisites for this to be effective including appropriate resourcing, training, facilitative skills and acknowledges that collaborations can be extremely fragile. However, such projects need further investment, experimentation and implementation on an international scale to share learning and promote creative approaches for the development and learning of social work students.

AB  - The low number of diagnosed cases of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) in adolescents may be deceptive since early exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may not emerge as AIDS until young adulthood. Here, the epidemiology of AIDS among adolescents is reviewed, & their risk status described as high due to such behaviors as early & risky sexual activity & intravenous (IV) drug use. Analysis of 1990 data from the Centers for Disease Control on patterns of infection, patterns of behavior, & differences in subgroups of adolescents, indicates those at highest risk are gay youth, IV drug users, homeless & runaway youth, members of racial & ethnic minority groups, & youth in inner cities. Using sexually transmitted diseases as a model for AIDS, a clear danger of increasing prevalence of AIDS among the adolescent population is identified; implications for prevention & treatment are discussed, & the need for increased information & intervention is stressed. 4 Tables, 1 Figure, 41 References.

AB  - Adolescence is a developmental period during which many youth experiment with risk practices. This paper examined the association of parental monitoring with a range of alcohol & other drug (AOD) use behaviors among high-risk youth, while controlling for other demographic & environmental variables previously found to be associated with AOD use. Participants were recruited as part of a longitudinal evaluation study of four youth drop-in centers located in Southern California. These centers served at-risk youth, including Hispanic, Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Questioning (LGBQ), & homeless & runaway youth. Participants were aged 14 to 24 & were new attendees at the drop-in centers. Results from logistic regression analyses revealed that while controlling for demographic & environmental variables, adolescents who reported less parental monitoring were more likely to report lifetime use of cigarettes, marijuana, & methamphetamine, & in the past three months, use of alcohol & binge drinking. The findings thus indicate that, even among high-risk youth, those who reported low parental monitoring were significantly more likely to use a variety of substances. Implications of these findings are discussed as they pertain to AOD prevention & interventions for children & their families. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Food insecurity is a pressing public health concern in many developing countries. Despite widespread interest in the sociocultural determinants of food insecurity, little is known about whether youths living in food insecure households experience food insecurity. The buffering hypothesis reviewed here assumes that, to the extent possible, adult members of households will buffer younger household members from the ill effects of food insecurity. A variant of the buffering hypothesis argues that only certain members of the households will enjoy the benefits of buffering. We hypothesize that within the context of Ethiopia, where girls have historically experienced discrimination, buffering is preferentially aimed at boys, especially as the household experiences greater levels of food stress. These hypotheses are tested using data from a population-based study of 2084 adolescents living in southwestern Ethiopia. Results indicate that boys and girls were equally likely to be living in severely food insecure households. Despite no differences in their households' food insecurity status, girls were more likely than boys to report being food insecure themselves. This gender difference was the largest in severely food insecure households. This same pattern was observed when comparing male-female sibling pairs living in the same household. These results are among the first to show that household level measures of food insecurity predict adolescent experiences of food insecurity, and that in the Ethiopian socio-cultural context, the relationship between household level food insecurity and adolescent food insecurity varies by gender. We also show that adolescent food insecurity is strongly associated with measures of general health and well-being. [Copyright 2007 Elsevier Ltd.]

AB  - People experiencing homelessness are particularly vulnerable to experiencing stressful life events (SLEs) at some point in their lives; these SLEs are crucial for understanding the etiology and maintenance of homelessness. This study analyses the differences between men and women experiencing homelessness in the suffering of SLEs throughout their lives (childhood, adolescence, and adulthood). The sample consisted of a group of 293 people experiencing homelessness in Madrid (Spain): 156 men and 137 women. The results suggest that the number and type of SLEs experienced by men and women are different. In general, women experiencing homelessness suffer more SLEs than men in all periods of their lives. The differences in the level of sexual violence in childhood, sexual abuse in adulthood, and abuse by a spouse or partner are particularly striking. However, men experiencing homelessness score significantly higher than women for alcohol abuse, police complaints, arrest, and imprisonment throughout their lives. These findings have significant implications for the design of interventions and social policies that should be tailored to the specific needs of men and women who are homeless.

AB  - Objective This systematic review synthesizes effectiveness evidence on interventions to prevent and address youth homelessness. It was conducted primarily for a United States policy and practice audience but involved an international synthesis of evidence. Method We conducted an international search that included eleven major academic electronic databases, 13 additional relevant institutional web-based publication databases, and a professional outreach for published and unpublished studies of the effectiveness of programs and practices to prevent or address youth homelessness, in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. We searched databases for studies published or completed between January 1, 2008 and March 19, 2019, and we also reviewed earlier studies synthesized in a similar past systematic review that ended its search in 2008. The review included experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation studies of youth ages 13–25. We included studies that only used pre-post comparisons and denote lower rigor designs clearly in the synthesis. Results The search identified 4,387 potentially relevant unique publications. After screening, 66 publications representing 53 unique studies of 54 different interventions remained and were included in this review. The vast majority (83%) of unique studies were conducted in the U.S. Of the 53 unique studies, 22 (42%) involved some type of randomized evaluation. Many studies involved low rigor designs with weak counterfactuals, small sample sizes, and short follow-up periods. Included studies evaluated a range of interventions, and we grouped these into seven broad categories. The largest evidence base on the effectiveness of interventions relates to counseling and treatment interventions to address mental health or health risk behaviors. Overall, these studies showed promising results, but few included long-term follow-up. A small number of studies demonstrated reductions in occurrence of youth homelessness and housing instability, including some intensive case management and support interventions without direct housing assistance components. The field lacks rigorous evaluative evidence of many of the program models on which communities and governments rely to address youth homelessness (for example, street outreach, transitional living programs, youth shelters, host homes, and rapid rehousing). Evaluative evidence is further lacking on how the effects of interventions vary by subpopulations disproportionately impacted by homelessness. Discussion and conclusion Policy and community interventions to prevent and end youth homelessness require a robust evidence base to inform decision-making. This systematic review presents an important starting point to inform solutions across a range of intervention areas, and it reveals significant areas in which investments in research and evaluation are urgently needed.

AB  - A randomized trial compared effects of a Family Critical Time Intervention (FCTI) to usual care for children in 200 newly homeless families in which mothers had diagnosable mental illness or substance problems. Adapted from an evidence-based practice to prevent chronic homelessness for adults with mental illnesses, FCTI combines housing and structured, time-limited case management to connect families leaving shelter with community services. Families were followed at five time points over 24 months. Data on 311 children--99 ages 1.5-5 years, 113 ages 6-10 years, and 99 ages 11-16 years--included mother-, teacher-, and child-reports of mental health, school experiences, and psychosocial well-being. Analyses used hierarchical linear modeling to investigate intervention effects and changes in child functioning over time. Referral to FCTI reduced internalizing and externalizing problems in preschool-aged children and externalizing for adolescents 11-16. The intervention led to declines in self-reported school troubles for children 6-10 and 11-16. Both experimental and control children in all age groups showed reductions in symptoms over time. Although experimental results were scattered, they suggest that FCTI has the potential to improve mental health and school outcomes for children experiencing homelessness.

AB  - Diet, screen time, physical activity, and sleep combine into lifestyle patterns with synergistic effects on health. This study aimed to identify lifestyle patterns in children without housing and assess their associations with physical and mental health and family socio-ecological factors. In the 2013 ENFAMS cross-sectional survey (children aged 6–12 experiencing homelessness, Greater Paris area, n = 235), parents reported socio-ecological factors, children’s behaviours, and mental health (the latter was also child-reported). Nurses measured children’s haemoglobin concentrations and body mass index. Principal component analysis was used to derive sex-specific lifestyle patterns. Hierarchical linear regressions and “outcome-wide” analyses assessed, respectively, these patterns’ relations to health and family socio-ecological factors. A rather healthy lifestyle pattern—similarly characterized by diverse diet and high sleep time—was identified, with slight differences by sex. Scores for this pattern were higher for children in food-secure or higher-income households, whose parents were proficient in French, who slept longer, or who received more social support compared to their counterparts, with some nuances by sex. Higher scores for this pattern were associated with higher prosocial behaviour scores (girls) and lower anxiety and hyperactivity–inattention symptoms scores (boys), but not with physical health. For this underserved and understudied population, the results highlight the importance of family socio-ecological factors in shaping the lifestyles and mental health of children.

AB  - High level of mental health problems are a critical concern among youth experiencing or at-risk of homelessness. Using data from a randomized controlled trial on Housing First in Canada, this study examined the risk factors and protective resources associated with mental health recovery among 215 homeless youth with mental illness at baseline and at a 24-month follow-up. At study entry, higher levels of recovery were associated with a lower number of adverse childhood experiences, less frequent presence of mental health symptoms, higher level of satisfaction with social relationships, and a higher level of psychological integration at baseline. At 24-months, a lower frequency of experiencing mental health symptoms and a higher level of psychological integration were associated with a higher level of recovery. The study’s findings highlight the importance of protective resources, notably having supportive social relationships and a sense of belonging in the community as contributors to mental health recovery

Undergraduate students interviewed clients at diverse social service agencies in Los Angeles that include homeless shelters, child welfare organizations, domestic violence organizations, LGBTQIA youth‐oriented agencies, nonprofits serving older adults, schools, and organizations serving low‐income families. Students used the information gathered from the interviews to visually map their clients' environmental and structural barriers, as well as their pathways to service. The research team then analyzed the students' visual maps to create one cohesive, complex, and multilayered visual map representing clients' overall barriers and pathways to social services in Los Angeles.

AB  - This longitudinal study examines characteristics associated with the timing of three potential foster care outcomes -- reunification, adoption, & running away from care (i.e., AWOL). Cox regression modeling was used to identify child & case characteristics associated with each outcome for a statewide sample of children entering care in Rhode Island following implementation of the Adoption & Safe Families Act (ASFA). Results revealed strong differences in both the rates & patterns of exits from care across discharge categories. Risk for reunification began almost immediately upon entry to care & generally decreased over time (despite a sharp spike in rates at the 10- to 12-month period), while risk for adoption was initially low & began to escalate at about the 9-month mark. AWOL rates were lower than those of reunification & adoption, & remained relatively stable over time. A number of child & case characteristics were associated with likelihood of exiting foster care. In many cases, the characteristics operated differently depending on exit type, though in other instances there was consistency indicating that some risk factors are likely to be associated with delays in achieving permanency (e.g., removal due to sexual abuse, presence of child emotional/behavioral disorder). Implications of these findings for child welfare research & practice are discussed. Tables, Figures, References. [Copyright 2005 Elsevier B.V.]

AB  - Gender-specific explanations for living in the street were tested with ethnographic research & psychological testing of 42 male & 19 female children, ages 8-17, in the slums of Kibera & Mathare in Nairobi, Kenya. Test data found only partial support for the hypothesis that street girls would exhibit more psychological maladjustment than boys, because they would only end up on the street if there were a breakdown in the family process that traditionally keeps poor girls at home. Ethnographic data revealed that these girls' broken homes contributed to sexual abuse & sibling rivalry. Street girls were victims -- forced into prostitution or rejected by others. However, street boys were often fully able to cope & act like adults by age 10 & maintained contact with their families. It is concluded that girls end up on the street because of a broken developmental path. 35 References. M. Pflum

AB  - The current foster care system in America has not been successful in transitioning youth who are in the system to become productive, independent adults in today's society. Study after study cites the poor adjustment of foster care youth in school settings because of constant change in foster care placements and the corresponding poor achievement of these students. We find many of the youth needing public aide, working at low-paying jobs (if working at all), often caught up in the criminal corrections system, and homeless. Having had no permanent home and very often lacking positive role models, these children have little opportunity to build a solid foundation that might give them the chance to succeed. In addition, the current foster care system has in place short-term home placements, and this system is failing. What is needed are long-term placements for these children -- placements that last until adulthood. What we are suggesting is that we as a society consider bringing back orphanages -- well-run facilities that provide a stable environment over time, good educational opportunities, and the chance for the children to develop emotionally in a secure, nurturing environment such as those found at Boys Town, the Hershey School, Kinderhaus and The SEED Foundation.

AB  - In the present report we describe patterns of traumatic events and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), both partial and full, among homeless youth and those at risk for homelessness, with an emphasis on gender differences. Participants were 85 homeless and at-risk youth (49% female) recruited from a drop-in center in New York City in 2000. Youth completed a structured interview lasting 1.5 h. Rates of childhood maltreatment were substantial. Further, almost all youth experienced at least one traumatic event, with most experiencing multiple types of trauma. Gender differences were found in the types, but not prevalence or magnitude, of childhood maltreatment and traumatic events experienced. Partial symptomatology of PTSD was common for females but not males. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were found to co-occur with PTSD for females, which may complicate treatment efforts. Further investigation of the impact of trauma on homeless males is needed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The purpose of this study was to test the generalizability of previous research on gender differences between men and women with co-occurring schizophrenia and substance abuse. One hundred eight patients with schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder involved in a study of treatment for homeless persons were interviewed for information regarding substance use, social functioning and support, comorbid disorders, victimization, medical illness, and legal troubles. We found that women had more children and were more socially connected than men. Women also had higher rates of sexual and physical victimization, comorbid anxiety and depression, and medical illness than men. We conclude that homeless women with dual disorders, like women with substance use disorders in the general population, have distinct characteristics, vulnerabilities, and treatment needs compared with men. In addition to comprehensive treatment of psychiatric and substance use disorders, gender-specific services should be developed, including prevention and treatment of victimization and related problems as well as help with accessing medical services.

AB  -  Food insecurity is a pressing public health concern in many developing countries. Despite widespread interest in the sociocultural determinants of food insecurity, little is known about whether youths living in food insecure households experience food insecurity. The buffering hypothesis reviewed here assumes that, to the extent possible, adult members of households will buffer younger household members from the ill effects of food insecurity. A variant of the buffering hypothesis argues that only certain members of the households will enjoy the benefits of buffering. We hypothesize that within the context of Ethiopia, where girls have historically experienced discrimination, buffering is preferentially aimed at boys, especially as the household experiences greater levels of food stress. These hypotheses are tested using data from a population-based study of 2084 adolescents living in southwestern Ethiopia. Results indicate that boys and girls were equally likely to be living in severely food insecure households. Despite no differences in their households' food insecurity status, girls were more likely than boys to report being food insecure themselves. This gender difference was the largest in severely food insecure households. This same pattern was observed when comparing male-female sibling pairs living in the same household. These results are among the first to show that household level measures of food insecurity predict adolescent experiences of food insecurity, and that in the Ethiopian socio-cultural context, the relationship between household level food insecurity and adolescent food insecurity varies by gender. We also show that adolescent food insecurity is strongly associated with measures of general health and well-being. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Adolescent parenthood occurs with relative frequency among youth in the foster care system. Few studies describe the characteristics of adolescent parents in foster care, or compare male and female parents, particularly using large, national samples. The present study used data from the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD; N = 15,601) to document the number of foster youth who had children at age 17 years, the factors associated with adolescent parenthood, and the differences between male and female parents on general functioning indicators and use of Chafee services. Results revealed that 4% of males and 10% of females in the NYTD sample had children. Multivariate analyses indicated that for males and females alike, non-White race and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with increased likelihood of childbirth. Among males, the multivariate odds of being a parent increased substantially if they had a history of homelessness, substance abuse referral, or incarceration. Among females, only a history of incarceration was significantly associated with parenthood. Receiving Chafee-funded services was not related to either male or female parenthood. These findings highlight the high rates of adolescent parenthood among youth in foster care, particularly if other risk factors are also present. Practice implications and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: Transgender and gender non-binary youth (TGNBY) experience suicidal ideation and suicide attempts at significantly higher rates than their cisgender peers. The present study aims to evaluate the evidence and to determine protective factors for TGNBY adolescents experiencing suicidality. Methods: The literature was searched for concepts related to suicide in the transgender and gender non-binary population according to the PRISMA-P 2015 Checklist. The search strategies were created using a combination of keywords and standardized index terms. Searches were run in February 2020 in Ovid EBM Reviews, Ovid Embase (1974+), Ovid Medline (1946+ including epub ahead of print, in-process & other non-indexed citations), Ovid PsycINFO (1806+), Scopus (1970+) and Web of Science (1975+). Results were limited to English language and journal articles from 2000+. All results were exported to Endnote where obvious duplicates were removed leaving 910 citations. Inclusion criteria included, but were not limited to: age 24 and younger, with suicidality, interventions that benefit the study population either by preventing adverse effects/morbidity or decreasing completed suicides in this population. Three authors (JC, RI, and KL) reviewed 910 articles and a consensus was reached regarding inclusion or exclusion. Results: A total of 55 articles met inclusion criteria; the remaining 855 articles were excluded. A number of thematic findings emerged when reviewing the included articles. Evidence was of low to moderate quality and included case reports, case series, observational studies, and few randomized controlled trials. Overall, studies report that TGNBY have rates of suicidal ideation ranging from 40-61%, significantly higher than non-TGNBY peers. Risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempt include bullying victimization, low parental support, housing insecurity, history of physical or sexual abuse, prior mental health diagnoses, depressive symptoms, lower body esteem including dissatisfaction with weight, relationship violence, safety issues at school, and substance use. Reported protective factors include use of chosen name and pronouns, access to gender affirming medical care, family support, peer support, and school support. Conclusions: Suicidality is a major concern among transgender and gender non-binary youth. Interventions that have been suggested in the literature to decrease rates of suicide in transgender and gender non-binary youth include public health interventions that promote safe and inclusive school environments, increase access to gender affirming healthcare services, and facilitate family support. Additional interventions to consider include access to mental health providers, TGNBY support groups, family therapy, and interdisciplinary gender clinics. Future directions include exploration of how to best convey the importance of the above protective factors in settings that serve youth and families in order to prevent TGNBY suicidality.

AB  - Female youth experiencing homelessness are at high risk for pregnancy due to a host of individual, family, and community-level risk factors. This embedded mixed-method quasi-experimental pilot study examined the initial outcomes of Wahine (woman) Talk, a comprehensive sexual health program delivered by an interdisciplinary team to female youth experiencing homelessness. Wahine Talk includes provision of and connection to basic needs resources, peer mentoring, group based sexual health education, and linkage to and provision of sexual health care. Process and outcome data were collected throughout and for six months after Wahine Talk from a diverse group of 14–22-year-old female youth (N = 51) experiencing homelessness. In-depth individual and focus group interview data were collected from providers and youth after Wahine Talk, and analyzed using Template Analysis. Over half (62.7%) of participants were linked to sexual health care during Wahine Talk and birth control usage tripled following the program. Depo-Provera and long acting reversible contraception (LARC) usage, in particular, increased during Wahine Talk (1–19% and 0–25.5%, respectively). Within six months, 31.4% of youth had adopted LARC and 3.9% were using Depo-Provera. Individual and focus group interviews with providers and youth affirm program acceptability and appropriateness.

This article intends to inform the child welfare field on existing gaps in services & areas where more training & technical support is necessary in providing services to homeless LGB youth. The findings point to substantial differences within the homeless youth sample & demonstrate that in addition to the public health risks young people face merely by being homeless, the risks are exacerbated for those who self-identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. The article informs child welfare providers & policymakers about the substantial vulnerability of LGB youth beyond that of non-LGB homeless youth & the need to fund programming, training, technical assistance & further research to specifically respond to the complex needs of this population.

Homeless adolescents use substances at extremely high rates compared to other youth, & experience considerable negative consequences as a result. Yet homeless adolescents are not reached by, or are not responsive to, traditional prevention & treatment programs for substance use & abuse. The rationale for the use of brief feedback interventions is reviewed, & one such program that was designed to reduce substance use risk among homeless youth is described. The intervention is consistent with tenants of harm reduction in its effort to encourage engagement via its structure, minimal demands, & flexible clinical strategies & goals. Modifications made to the intervention based on lessons learned from an initial trial are described, & highlight the importance of tailoring harm reduction programs to facilitate engagement based on clients' life circumstances, availability, & motivation. 1 Table, 1 Figure, 84 References.

AB  - This article links the development of service user involvement championed in the United Kingdom to two examples in Dutch-speaking qualifying social work programmes: one from Belgium and one from the Netherlands. In both projects, a longer lasting cooperation with more marginalised service users was established. The Belgium project highlights social work lecturers and service users living in poverty, working in tandem to deliver a module to social work and socio-educational care work students. The example from the Netherlands involves young people from a homeless shelter as peer-researchers, working together with social work students.Both projects, one focusing on social work education and on social work research, highlight striking similarities in the positives and challenges of working with service users including how this challenges both groups preconceptions of the other, deepens learning but also creates greater potential for confrontations which need to be managed creatively. The article also identifies the pre-requisites for this to be effective including appropriate resourcing, training, facilitative skills and acknowledges that collaborations can be extremely fragile. However, such projects need further investment, experimentation and implementation on an international scale to share learning and promote creative approaches for the development and learning of social work students.

AB  -  Runaway youths represent a neglected clinical group, and few studies have examined ethnicity differences within this population. Substance use, family functioning and related problem behaviors were examined in a sample of Hispanic and Anglo runaway youths with substance abuse diagnoses (N = 145). Youths, aged 12-17, were recruited from two urban, southwestern runaway shelters. Within single-parent families, Anglo youths reported more marijuana use, and, regardless of family constitution, reported more tobacco use than did Hispanic youths. Overall, Anglo youths reported more externalizing problems and more conflict tactics used in resolving disagreements with their primary caretaker while Hispanic youths reported higher depression and familism scores. Given the differences found between Hispanic and Anglo youths, the findings argue that culturally sensitive interventions for runaway youths and families are warranted.

AB  - Objective: As part of a larger community-based, service-driven research project, the primary purpose of this pilot randomized study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of delivering time-limited adaptations of parent–child interaction therapy (PCIT) and child–parent psychotherapy (CPP) within a sample of children experiencing homelessness. The secondary goal was to examine the promise of both interventions in improving parent/child outcomes. Method: One hundred forty-four young children (18 month–5 years old; Mage = 3.48, SD = 1.09; 43.1% female; 78.5% Black/African American; 27.1% Hispanic) and their mothers were recruited from a women's homeless shelter and randomly assigned to 12 weeks of either PCIT or CPP delivered by shelter clinicians on-site. Attendance, fidelity, and program satisfaction were obtained. Families completed pre- and postintervention assessments, including observational data on maternal verbalizations during a child-led play session. Results: Both time-limited PCIT and time-limited CPP were successfully implemented with similarly high levels of intervention fidelity (>90%) and satisfaction by mothers (85%). Completion rates were similar across both time-limited PCIT (76.6%) and time-limited CPP (71.4%). Both time-limited CPP and PCIT resulted in decreases in children's posttraumatic stress, parental stress, and increases in maternal positive verbalizations. Only time-limited PCIT resulted in significant improvements in externalizing behavior problems in children and reductions in maternal negative verbalizations. Conclusions: Time-limited PCIT and CPP are acceptable, feasible, and hold significant promise for helping families within a homeless shelter environment and by extension, other transitional and/or shelter environments. A full randomized trial is warranted to determine which program may offer a more effective intervention.

AB  - We recruited a cohort of 157 recent orphans and 480 non-orphans aged 9-15 in a region of high HIV/AIDS mortality in South Africa using stratified cluster sampling to determine the impact of recent parental death on health and food insecurity of school-going orphans compared to non-orphans over time. Between September 2004 and June 2007, household heads, caregivers, and children were interviewed at three annual intervals. Bivariate associations and multivariate models were assessed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). In the health domain, compared to non-orphans, double orphans were more likely to report worse health status and being very ill in the previous 12 months. For those who reported being very ill, maternal or paternal orphans were more than twice as likely not to seek care than non-orphans; no differences were found for double orphans. For nutrition and food insecurity, maternal or paternal orphans were more likely not to have eaten dinner and to have gone to bed hungry the previous night compared to non-orphans; no differences were found for double orphans. Overall, recent school-aged orphans were disadvantaged in health and food insecurity within two years after the death of a parent, compared to their non-orphaned counterparts, but the disparities were smaller than expected. No changes in health, nutritional status, or food insecurity were apparent over the three study rounds. Longer term effects into adulthood may well be more pronounced and warrant careful longitudinal investigation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This article compares heterosexual and sexual minority street-involved youth across a number of sociodemographic, risk and current mental health, victimization and delinquency measures with a particular focus on gender differences. The sample consists of 147 homeless and street-involved young men and women aged 16-21 years in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Bivariate analyses indicate that many of the differences between the heterosexual and sexual minority youth are driven by differences among the young women. Multivariate analyses are then used to test for interactions between gender and sexual minority status alongside controls. The results suggest that gender, sexuality and street involvement intersect to shape outcomes in more complex ways than are acknowledged by the notion of accumulating or multiplying disadvantage common in the literature. The article concludes with a discussion focused on providing a more nuanced view of the experience of youth homelessness at the intersection of gender and sexuality. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Objective Limited research has evaluated the efficacy of suicide prevention interventions among homeless youth, especially considering how their connectedness with their family would impact treatment outcomes. Method Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) between the ages of 18–24 years were recruited from a local drop-in center. Youth were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or Treatment as Usual alone. Youth reported their family network satisfaction at the baseline assessment, whereas their suicidal ideation, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness were assessed at baseline and three additional times during a nine-month period. Results A multiple-group autoregressive cross-lagged model suggests that CTSP was associated with lower suicidal ideation and lower thwarted belongingness only among those with high family network satisfaction. Among both groups, perceived burdensomeness predicted higher suicidal ideation, which in turn predicted lower perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. Additionally, only among youth with low family network satisfaction, thwarted belongingness predicted lower suicidal ideation. Conclusions Findings suggest that family network satisfaction may be an important factor when considering cognitive interventions with homeless youth, with implications to improve treatment efforts and to reduce premature mortality, hospitalization and loss of human capital in a very high-risk population.

Such disadvantage often co-exists with other risk factors including a history of abuse as well as socio-cultural differences such as being from minority of an Indigenous background where there can be additional issues such as social marginalisation or prejudice. Care systems can often compound these problems by exposing children to further loss and disruption or unstable placements, and often struggle in returning children home to parents experiencing a high burden of disadvantage and significant poverty. In this paper, we report the findings of an Australian study that examined longitudinal data on reasons for entry to care, trajectories in care and patterns of reunification and associated factors. Case-file reviews and placement tracking analyses were conducted for 502 children to identify predictors of reunification. Analytical techniques included cluster analysis, survival and proportional hazards models to examine the reunification trajectories of different groups of children and families. Most reunifications were found to occur within 12 months. Poverty in the form of financial problems and homelessness emerged as predictors of a lower probability of reunification status along with Indigenous status and family structure. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of policies and practices that could influence the child, family and environmental characteristics associated with entry to care and reunification.

AB  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning (LGBQ) youth are overrepresented among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH), and health disparities among LGBQ youth are well-documented. LGBQ youth are typically aggregated as a single sexual minority group; however, research suggests that bisexual youth may have greater mental health, substance use, and physical health risks relative to their gay and lesbian peers. In a probability sample of LGBQ YEH in Los Angeles County (n = 183), we examined subgroup differences in homelessness severity, depression, physical health, and substance use, focusing on differences between bisexual and gay/lesbian youth due to the small subsample of questioning youth. Indicators of homelessness severity were standalone outcomes, and also were integrated as control variables with gender, age, race/ethnicity, and education in multivariable models. Bisexual youth were more likely to have become unaccompanied homeless persons as minors (OR = 4.35, 95% CI 1.85–10.23), and to have not recently utilized emergency shelters or transitional housing at least once in the past month (OR = 6.41; 95% CI 2.41–17.03). Bisexual youth were more likely to have probable depression (OR = 4.06, 95% CI 1.41–11.68). Among sexual minority YEH, bisexual youth may be at elevated risk for depression, in addition to more severe homelessness.

AB  - The number of older homeless people with a limited life expectancy is increasing. European studies on their health‐related characteristics are lacking. This study compared self‐reported health, healthcare service use and health‐related needs of older and younger homeless people in the Netherlands. It is part of a cohort study that followed 513 homeless people in the four major Dutch cities for a period of 2.5 years, starting from the moment they registered at the social relief system in 2011. Using cross‐sectional data from 378 participants who completed 2.5‐year follow‐up, we analysed differences in self‐reported health, healthcare service use, and health‐related needs between homeless adults aged ≥50 years (N = 97) and <50 years (N = 281) by means of logistic regression. Results show that statistically significantly more older than younger homeless people reported cardiovascular diseases (23.7% versus 10.3%), visual problems (26.8% versus 14.6%), limited social support from family (33.0% versus 19.6%) and friends or acquaintances (27.8% versus 14.6%), and medical hospital care use in the past year (50.5% versus 34.5%). Older homeless people statistically significantly less often reported cannabis (12.4% versus 45.2%) and excessive alcohol (16.5% versus 27.0%) use in the past month and dental (20.6% versus 46.6%) and mental (16.5% versus 25.6%) healthcare use in the past year. In both age groups, few people reported unmet health‐related needs. In conclusion, compared to younger homeless adults, older homeless adults report fewer substance use problems, but a similar number of dental and mental problems, and more physical and social problems. The multiple health problems experienced by both age groups are not always expressed as needs or addressed by healthcare services. Older homeless people seem to use more medical hospital care and less non‐acute, preventive healthcare than younger homeless people. This vulnerable group might benefit from shelter‐based or community outreach programmes that proactively provide multidisciplinary healthcare services.

AB  - Historically, insufficient resources & assistance have been provided to young people leaving state care. Care leavers have been found to experience significant health, social & educational deficits including homelessness, disproportionate involvement in juvenile crime & prostitution, poor social supports, & early parenthood. The U.S. & Australia share a roughly common political language & system & have often exchanged ideas, agendas, & policies for government. This paper finds that whilst there are some minor differences in the respective legislative frameworks & responses, the similarities are far greater. Both countries have failed to provide the range of in-care, transitional, & post-care supports & services required to ensure improved outcomes for care leavers. 48 References.

AB  - Researchers have found that adolescents who identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual (GLB) are at a higher risk for increased substance use and mental health symptoms. The current study is a secondary analysis of two clinical trials for street-living youth. This analysis examines self-identification as GLB as a moderator of treatment effects and addresses whether street-living GLB youth respond differently to a therapeutic intervention than non-GLB street-living youth. Comparisons were made of treatment outcomes on two categories of variables (drug use and mental health symptoms) among 244 homeless GLB and non-GLB identified adolescents. Overall, GLB and non-GLB adolescents showed similar reductions in drug use and mental health symptoms. However, compared to non-GLB adolescents, GLB adolescents showed greater improvement in reduction of drug use and internalizing and depressive symptom scores. While both groups reported less drug use and fewer mental health symptoms from baseline to post-intervention, GLB youth's scores improved more drastically. Implications of using the identified treatment intervention are discussed. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

AB  - Although a substantial body of literature demonstrates high prevalence of street victimization among homeless youth, few studies have investigated the existence of victimization classes that differ on the type and frequency of victimization experienced. Nor do we know how substance use patterns relate to victimization classes. Using latent class analysis (LCA), we examined the existence of victimization classes of homeless youth and investigated substance use predictors of class membership utilizing a large purposive sample (N = 601) recruited from homeless youth-serving host agencies in three disparate regions of the U.S. Results of the LCA suggest the presence of three distinct victimization profiles -- youth fit into a low-victimization class, a witness class, or a high-victimization class. These three victimization classes demonstrated differences in their substance use, including rates of substance abuse/dependence on alcohol and/or drugs. The presence of distinct victimization profiles suggests the need for screening and referral for differential services. [Copyright Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB  - Offers an overview of the literature investigating risk factors associated with the onset of problem -- as distinct from experimental -- drug use, divided into retrospective studies of problem users & prospective, longitudinal studies of young people. Risk factors include having parents or siblings with problem drug use; family disruption; poor attachment or communication with parents; child abuse; low school grades, truancy, or exclusion from school; childhood conduct disorder; crime; mental disorder (particularly depression & suicidal behavior during adolescence); social deprivation (although evidence is limited); & young age of drug use onset. These factors are highly interconnected & best viewed as an interactive web of causation. On the basis of these findings, several high risk or vulnerable groups can be identified: the homeless, those looked after by local authorities or in foster care, prostitutes, truants, those excluded from school, young offenders, children from families with substance-abusing parents or siblings, & young people with conduct or depressive disorders. While delivering successful preventive interventions to these groups will be a difficult challenge, it should be a focus for future work. A key issue is the need to embed a drugs input in the work already delivered by the responsible agencies. Future research should concentrate on the prevalence & nature of drug use in these groups, but there is also a need for longitudinal studies that can throw more light on the development of drug careers in the UK. 63 References.

AB  - Background Retention in substance use treatment is one of the strongest predictors of improved outcomes among adolescents, making retention an important goal of treatment. We examined treatment providers’ perspectives on barriers and facilitators to treatment retention among adolescents, and their views on contributors to racial/ethnic disparities in retention including ways to address disparities.Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 providers at state-licensed detoxification, residential, and outpatient facilities serving adolescents for substance use disorders in Massachusetts. Interviews were coded by at least two independent coders.Results Providers identified barriers and facilitators at the policy/systems, facility, family, and client levels. Some of the barriers included insurance limits on sessions/length of stay and low reimbursement (policy/systems), staff turnover (facility), low family engagement (family), and low internal motivation (client). Some facilitators mentioned were support from state’s substance use agency (policy/systems), flexibility with meeting location (facility), family participation (family), and high internal motivation and presence of external motivators (client). Barriers that contributed to racial/ethnic disparities included lower socio-economic status, language barriers, and mistrust. Having bilingual/bicultural staff and multi-lingual materials, and facilitating transportation were identified as strategies for reducing disparities in treatment retention.Conclusions It is critical that adolescents who access substance use services remain and complete treatment and that there is equity in treatment retention. Provider perspectives in factors associated with retention can inform the development of comprehensive interventions and policies to help improve retention and reduce disparities.

Consideration of patterns of educational attainment through the mid-30s for all women, disaggregated by age at first birth, allows for an examination of the amount of education received by teen mothers relative to women who delay giving birth until adulthood. Racial-ethnic differences in patterns of attainment are examined as well. Analysis then shifts to teen mothers & examines the composition of educational attainment according to the amount of time elapsed since the first birth. Findings suggest that later life education among teen mothers is an important & understudied phenomenon with implications for welfare reform & adult education policies. 4 Tables, 8 Figures, 31 References.

AB  - At a time when homelessness, inequality and poverty plague Canadian society, an organization in Whistler, British Columbia has been working for over 20 years to combat some of the associated issues faced by vulnerable youth. This multi-year research project explored one of the programs offered by the organization with the intent of gaining an understanding of the short- and long-term impact, the future requirements for sustainability and growth, and the alignment of the program to local and regional needs. Through a series of focus groups, qualitative data was collected and, while the focus of the research project fell across the identified program foci of housing, employment, participant experience, and support, this article focuses specifically on the findings related to employment. The five themes that were identified in the data collected included: participants' context, processes to support accountability, contributors to success, challenges, and participants' suggestions for improvement. Across these themes and sub-themes, it was clear that stable employment is a necessary component of a comprehensive program that supports youth as they build resilience and combat homelessness.

AB  - Most studies of condomless sex among homeless youth have focused on peer norms, while excluding other potentially pertinent influences. This study explored how different types of relationships contributed to norms about condomless sex and whether such norms were associated with engagement in condomless sex among homeless youth. Additionally, because recent work has noted gender differences in social networks of male and female homeless youth, gender differences in social network norms of condomless sex were also assessed. Egocentric network data were collected from homeless youth accessing services at two drop-in centers in Los Angeles, CA (N = 976). Multivariate analyses (non-stratified and stratified by gender) assessed associations between descriptive, injunctive, and communicative norms and participants' engagement in condomless sex. Multivariate analyses indicated that perception of peer condom use and communication with sexual partners were significantly associated with not engaging in condomless sex. These relationships, however, varied by gender. Implications for interventions are discussed.

AB  - Objective: Understanding patterns of dangerous and illicit substance use among young parents who are homeless may provide insight into how best to support this highly vulnerable group and their children. This study examines the relationship between having a biological child and drug use among youth experiencing homelessness. Method: We used 4 waves of cross-sectional data from 1,010 youths ages 14–26 at 3 drop-in agencies serving youth experiencing homeless in Los Angeles, CA. Among participants, 23.8% of males and 28.9% of females had a biological child. We conducted multivariate logistic regression models for males and females on 4 substance use behaviors in the past month: binge drinking, using hard/illicit drugs, prescription drug misuse, and injection drug use. Results: Fathers had greater odds of hard drug use, prescription drug misuse, and injection drug use than males without children. There was no significant relationship between having a child and any of the four substance use behaviors for females. Conclusions: Findings suggest that having a child is not associated with higher risk of dangerous or illicit substance use for females. Results highlight the need to proactively engage young males in pregnancy prevention, parenting programs, and substance use treatment and prevention.

The reasons for their existence are related to poverty, abuse, and modernizing factors. Street children are defined and distinguished from working and refugee children. Details about the family struc ture of street children are given. How the children cope and their level of psychological functioning are discussed. The article gives reasons for why the children are treated with such violence and gives attention to methodological research problems that include the children's ability to distort information, the researcher's procliv ity to under- or overestimate the children's emotional condition, distortions of facts created by the press and international organiza tions, and general cross-cultural research issues.

AB  - We examined the association between sexual risk behaviors & sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing in a sample of homeless youth. Of 261 youth interviewed, 50% had been sexually active in the past 3 months. Gender variation in sexual behaviors & risk were found. Boys were more likely than girls to engage in anal sex (46% vs. 15%), to have 3 or more sexual partners (46% vs. 17%) & to engage in anonymous sex (38% vs. 21%). Girls were less likely to use condoms consistently & more likely to engage in sex with a partner suspected of having an STI (20% vs. 4%). In the past 3 months, the STI testing rates were similar for boys & girls (46%). However, girls were more likely to have positive STI results (46% vs. 9%). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the only variable that was an independent predictor of STI testing was having either gotten someone or having become pregnant in the past 3 months. High-risk sexual behaviors did not predict STI testing in our sample. Outreach programs are needed that target sexually active homeless youth for early STI testing & treatment. Tables, References.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine whether abused and neglected children are at increased risk for subsequent crime victimization. We ask four basic questions: (a) Does a history of child abuse/neglect increase one's risk of physical, sexual, and property crime victimization? (b) Do lifestyle characteristics (prostitution, running away, homelessness, criminal history, drug abuse, and alcohol abuse) increase a person's risk for crime victimization? (c) Do lifestyle characteristics mediate the relationship between child abuse/ neglect and crime victimization? (d) Do these relationships vary by a person's sex or race/ethnicity? Using data from a prospective cohort design study, children with documented histories of physical and sexual abuse and/or neglect (n = 497) were matched with nonabused and nonneglected children ( n = 395), followed up, and interviewed in middle adulthood (approximate age 39.5). Logistic and ordinary least square regressions were conducted to assess risk for crime victimization and test for mediation. Child abuse and/ or neglect increased a person's risk for physical (OR = 2.56,  p< .001) and sexual (OR = 2.28, p< .001) but not for property crime victimization. For the sample overall, running away served as a partial mediator between child abuse and neglect and physical and sexual crime victimization. In addition, results revealed sex and race/ethnicity differences in patterns of mediation. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Background The child protection community is increasingly focused on developing tools to assess threats to child protection and the basic security needs and rights of children and families living in adverse circumstances. Although tremendous advances have been made to improve measurement of individual child health status or household functioning for use in low-resource settings, little attention has been paid to a more diverse array of settings in which many children in adversity spend time and how context contributes to threats to child protection. The SAFE model posits that insecurity in any of the following fundamental domains threatens security in the others: Safety/freedom from harm; Access to basic physiological needs and healthcare; Family and connection to others; Education and economic security. Site-level tools are needed in order to monitor the conditions that can dramatically undermine or support healthy child growth, development and emotional and behavioral health. From refugee camps and orphanages to schools and housing complexes, site-level threats exist that are not well captured by commonly used measures of child health and well-being or assessments of single households (e.g., SDQ, HOME).Methods The present study presents a methodology and the development of a scale for assessing site-level child protection threats in various settings of adversity. A modified Delphi panel process was enhanced with two stages of expert review in core content areas as well as review by experts in instrument development, and field pilot testing.Results Field testing in two diverse sites in India—a construction site and a railway station—revealed that the resulting SAFE instrument was sensitive to the differences between the sites from the standpoint of core child protection issues.

AB  - Purpose: Approximately 700,000 U.S. adolescents (aged 13-17) face homelessness annually. Among them, 10% of females and 3% of males are either pregnant or parenting, posing a multi-generational threat to health. Yet, there are few programs to improve health among parenting homeless youth and their children. To address this gap, an urban youth shelter launched a new transitional housing program for parenting youth with programming to improve parent and child health, and reduce unplanned subsequent pregnancies. The purpose of this community-engaged study was to adapt and implement an evidence-supported health empowerment program for pregnant and parenting youth living in shelter, and assess the program's feasibility and acceptability. Methods: Guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework for implementation research, we conducted a mixed-methods community needs assessment employing key informant interviews, focus groups, and/or questionnaires with three stakeholder groups: previously or currently homeless youth (n=17), shelter staff (n=20), and community experts (n=5). The needs assessment focused on program content and design. We analyzed data using content analysis (qualitative data) and descriptive statistics (quantitative data). A community-based team, including youth, staff, clinicians and researchers, selected an existing evidence-informed curriculum for a unified group-based intervention and tailored the intervention to address stakeholder-identified content areas and elements of program design. We further adapted the program using interviews, informal focus groups and surveys with youth participants (n=5) and program staff (n=5). All youth were female and pregnant or parenting, with children ages 0-3. Results: Our needs assessment identified several content areas of importance, including sexual health (e.g., healthy sexuality, relationships), mental health (e.g., post-partum mood concerns, trauma), and child health. Youth and staff identified several priorities for the program's design including that it should: be adaptable; incorporate a strengths-based, culturally-competent, and traumainformed approach; develop skills around both health and health care; leverage the key role of staff in promoting youth health; and integrate youth voice. Preliminary implementation data revealed that the program was acceptable to youth and staff, and aligned with the mission of the housing program. During implementation, group facilitators adapted the intervention to further integrate child- and mental-health content in response to participants' feedback and requests. With respect to program structure, participants: favored shorter sessions (1 hour), requested consistent female leaders, appreciated access to healthcare providers (group co-facilitators), and recognized the importance of childcare during sessions. Conclusions: Though youth parents and their children living in shelter face significant health risk, our initial findings suggest that health empowerment programming may be a feasible means of fostering resilience among this vulnerable population. Parents in the study expressed an interest in improving their own health and that of their child. Using the EPIS framework, this work highlights the importance of engaging youth, staff and community partners at all stages of a programdfrom initial exploration through program implementation. Future directions include: conducting ongoing feasibility evaluation, planning for sustainment, and scaling the intervention to similar transitional housing settings for parenting youth.

AB  - Youth homelessness is a problem characterized by high levels of vulnerability. The extent to which couch surfing - moving from one temporary housing arrangement to another - is part of youth homelessness is not well understood. Chapin Hall's Voices of Youth Count, a national research initiative, involves a multicomponent approach to studying youth homelessness. This study reports emerging findings regarding couch surfing and homelessness primarily from a national survey of 13,113 adults with youth ages 13-25 in their households or who are themselves ages 18-25. Findings suggest that couch surfing is relatively common, particularly among the older age group. Among households with 13- to 17-year-olds and 18- to 25-year-olds, 4.0% and 20.5%, respectively, reported that any of them had couch surfed in the last 12 months. There are notable social, economic, and educational differences, on average, between youth reporting homelessness and those reporting only couch surfing. However, most youth who report experiencing homelessness also report couch surfing, and these youth who experience both circumstances present high levels of socioeconomic vulnerability. Couch surfing encompasses a range of experiences, some of which likely include need for services. Interviews currently in the field, and expanded analysis of data, will contribute more nuanced policy insights.

AB  - Outreach work with youths in a precarious situation raises emotions and questions in workers while confronting them with their own suffering and fragility. In order to help them help as well as counter the risk of vicarious traumatisation, spaces for talking and exchanging with a third party have been created in various intervention settings. The objective is to allow them to elaborate on what their work makes them feel and thus preserve their stability and their ability to think. Through group or individual clinical discussions, these exchanges favor distancing and allow new perspectives on their work. That is why peer support appeared as an essential element for psychologists and therapists who support not only youths but the workers who help them. The setting up of our outreach meetings -- a result of our observation, allows keeping the flame alive without risking being burned. In this article, the issue of marginality in professionals working with homeless youths -- as well as our own -- is raised. It sometimes translates in the absence of a fixed location for a meeting symbolizing traditional stability, sometimes in the necessary flexibility of a framework to reach this population, sometimes in the openness to otherness and more precisely to a difference that disturbs when anxiety that this disaffiliated being raises, could well be our very self! Is it really marginality or a particular positioning aiming at constructive denunciation of stigmatization, unjust exclusion that youths with mental health and addiction problems sustain that place them at risk of homelessness? Neither missionaries, nor saviors are needed, but only hopeful facilitators working alongside people who want to stand up and take their place in society. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - We assessed the feasibility of ecological momentary assessment using short message service (SMS) surveying with 150 homeless youth. We found that on average, participants completed 18.8 days of texts, but 30% of youth (N = 44) had texting data on 28 or more days. The average number of texts answered per day was 8.49 (of a possible 11). Forty-three percent of days had answers to all 11 texts sent that day, and 69.4% of days had answers to eight or more texts. We found significant differences in response rates by phone type. Seventy-three percent of youth reported that responding to our texts was very easy or somewhat easy and 69% endorsed the response option “just enough,” regarding the number of texts sent per day. The 30-day texting period was deemed “about right” by 74% of youth. Details of using SMS with homeless youth are provided, and results indicate that this data collection technique is feasible with this population.

AB  -  We compared demographics, socioeconomic status, and food insecurity between households with and without recent orphans in a region of high HIV/AIDS mortality in South Africa. We recruited a cohort of 197 recent orphans and 528 non-orphans aged 9-15 years and their households using stratified cluster sampling. Households were classified into three groups: orphan-only (N = 50), non-orphan-only (N = 377), and mixed (N = 210). Between September 2004 and May 2007, households were interviewed three times regarding demographics, income and assets, and food insecurity. Baseline bivariate associations were assessed using chi-square test and t-test. Longitudinal bivariate associations and multivariate models were tested using generalized estimating equations. At baseline, mixed households generally exhibited greater characteristics of vulnerability than orphan-only and non-orphan-only households. They were larger, had older, less-educated household heads, and reported a much smaller annual per capita income. Orphan households were more likely to report a death in the previous year and less likely to have an adult employed. These differences persisted over the study. Even non-orphan-only households exhibited characteristics of vulnerability, with 14% reporting a death one year before baseline, 45% of whom were prime-age adults. At baseline, a much smaller proportion of orphan households reported receiving the child support grant than the other household types, but notably, there were no differences among households in receipt of the grant by Round 3. Household food insecurity was highly prevalent: more than one in five orphan-only and mixed households reported being food insecure in the previous month. These findings suggest that the effects of HIV/AIDS only exacerbate existing high levels of poverty in the district, as virtually all households are vulnerable regardless of orphan status. Community-level programs must help families address a spectrum of needs, including food security, caregiving, and financial support, as well as better target social welfare grants and make them more accessible to vulnerable households.

AB  - Aims and objectivesTo explore homelessness among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning plus (LGBTQ+) youth and to identify their support and care requirements.BackgroundLGBTQ+ youth face many health and societal challenges including issues related to homelessness.DesignA systematic review of qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies.MethodsA search of relevant electronic databases was carried out and included the dates August 2008–August 2018 and limited to academic journals and peer‐reviewed empirical studies written in English. Included studies specifically addressed the homeless experiences of youth aged 13–24 years old who identified as LGBTQ+. The PRISMA checklist was used in the review. A quality assessment instrument was used to review all of the selected papers and narrative methods utilised in the synthesis of the research evidence.ResultsThe search resulted in 319 papers, and after applying distinct inclusion criteria, a total of 14 papers were considered suitable for the systematic review. Following analysis, the four main themes identified were stigma, discrimination and exclusion; mental health issues and substance use; sexual risks and vulnerability; and interventions and supports.ConclusionLGBTQ+ homeless youth is a major public health concern that has significant consequences for a young person's physical and psychosocial well‐being.Relevance to clinical practicePractitioners need to be aware of the specific health and support requirements of LGBTQ+ youth in relation to homelessness. Inclusive and holistic care plans should exist that are fully responsive to the distinct needs of this group guided by definitive policies and sound clinical research. The implications for future nursing practice are presented and discussed.

Data from a national sample of 1,029 adolescents, aged 10-14, were analyzed. Results show that poor youth were .36 times as likely to own a home computer, but equally as likely to use their home computer for academic purposes as were non-poor youth. Poor youth did not differ from non-poor youth in how often they used any computer for academic purposes, but were less likely to use any computer for non-academic purposes. Government initiatives to close the digital divide & foster computer use among poor youth are suggested. 3 Tables, 45 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to describe the patterns in substance use and treatment utilization from admissions to publicly funded treatment programs among youth (aged 12–24 years) experiencing homelessness between the years of 1992 and 2017. Methods: We used the concatenated Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Treatment Episode Data Set Admissions (total youth admissions, n = 5,153,775; and youth reported being homeless at the time of admission, n = 241,310). Prevalence estimates and binary logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios to identify the differences among youth who reported being homeless or housed at the time of the treatment. Results: Homeless youth had higher odds than housed youth to self-refer for treatment; to enroll in treatment for cocaine/crack, heroin, or methamphetamine; and to receive treatment in 24-hour detoxication facilities or long-term residential facilities. Additional differences were identified among youth aged 12–17 years and youth aged 18–24 years and by sex within the homeless youth population. Conclusions: This analysis provides a picture of treatment utilization patterns by youth who are experiencing homelessness and substance use disorder, by exploring differences by housing status among admissions to publicly funded treatment facilities.

AB  - Although the consequences of the Great Recession are extensively discussed in previous research, three critical issue need to be addressed in order to develop a full portrait of the economic experiences of children during this period. First, given the changing immigrant composition of the US child population, new studies are needed for examining the implications of immigrant status for exposure to child poverty during the recession. Second, it is important to understand how traditional patterns of racial inequality among were transformed during the years of the recession. Finally, it is not clear whether recession-related changes in socioeconomic inequalities continued to have implications for child well-being in the post-recession period. Results from this analysis indicate that the adverse effects of the recession were most intense in states with significant changes in their populations of Black and Latino immigrant children. The results further show that declines in parental work opportunities were more consequential for poverty among Whites and Asians. The analysis also finds differential implications of family contexts for child poverty among Black immigrant and natives during the recession. Finally, the results indicate that increases in racial child poverty disparities during the recession did not disappear in the years following the downturn.

AB  - This study explored gender differences, sexual self-concept and life on the street among homeless adolescents who self-reported a history of sexual abuse. Individual interviews were conducted with 13 adolescents (six males and seven females) aged 18-20 years. There were salient themes shared by both males and females (vulnerability, sexual harassment, survival sex), and one theme specific to bisexual adolescents. Both males and females described aspects of their vulnerability related to being male or female. More than half the participants also described incidents of sexual harassment. In addition, both males and females stated that females needed the protection of males. Only one theme specific to youth with a bisexual orientation emerged related to the advantages of being bisexual. The findings indicate that sexual maturation takes place within the context of social and cognitive changes that can profoundly influence an individual's ability to develop a healthy sexual self-concept, including sexual awareness, sexual assertiveness, sexual self-efficacy, sexual esteem, sexual satisfaction and motivation to avoid risky sex. Further exploration related to sexual self-concept, the prevalence of sexual abuse and the impact of a sexual abuse history on the street life of homeless adolescents is warranted.

While there are some minor differences in the respective legislative frameworks & responses, the similarities are far greater. Both countries have failed to provide the range of in-care, transitional, & post-care supports & services required to ensure improved outcomes for care leavers. 74 References.

AB  - Given high levels of health and psychological costs associated with the family disruption of homelessness, identifying predictors of runaway and homeless episodes is an important goal. The current study followed 179 substance abusing, shelter-recruited adolescents who participated in a randomized clinical trial. Predictors of runaway and homeless episodes were examined over a two year period. Results from the hierarchical linear modeling analysis showed that family cohesion and substance use, but not family conflict or depressive symptoms, delinquency, or school enrollment predicted future runaway and homeless episodes. Findings suggest that increasing family support, care and connection and reducing substance use are important targets of intervention efforts in preventing future runaway and homeless episodes amongst a high risk sample of adolescents.

AB  - Unhoused youth are the most understudied subculture of the homeless and little time has been spent describing their lives on the streets. The few studies that have done so have tended 'to emphasize deviance as the central quality of unhoused youth by focusing mainly on unhoused youth who were particularly deviant and/or on their participation in illicit activities. To correct this, this dissertation, based on two ethnographic projects and in-depth interviews with unhoused youth, delves into an exploration of the daily lives of unhoused youth living on the streets of Hollywood, paying particular attention to the liminal position they often occupy. Part one addresses what street life is like for the newly unhoused youth, as well as the strategies unhoused youth use to survive on the streets. It also outlines the various physiological, psychological, biographic, and interpersonal obstacles unhoused youth face when trying to leave the streets and briefly explores the commonalities among unhoused youth who successfully left the streets. Building off the details of unhoused youth's daily lives presented in part one, part two examinees the fact that unhoused youth often occupy a liminal position in society, participating in both the conventional world of mainstream society and the illicit world of the street. It begins by detailing the ways current typologies do not accurately describe unhoused youth and argues that unhoused youth are more appropriately analyzed using a continuum. Following this, the dissertation addresses the appearances, talk, and activities of unhoused youth that explicitly claim and/or align with an 'on the street' identity as well as those that explicitly claim and/or align with an 'of the street' identity. Since an unhoused youth's participation in mainstream locations and activities is often contingent, however, on not being recognized as unhoused, it also explores the various strategies they use to conceal their status as such. Then, in order to demonstrate the liminal position that unhoused youth frequently occupy, part two concludes with a series of case studies that highlight the variability in the 'on the street' and 'of the street' identity claims and alignments of unhoused youth.

AB  - Aims Homeless mothers with young children in their care contend with high rates of substance use and low self-efficacy. However, a limited number of studies have examined these outcomes associated with housing and supportive services. Design Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) housing + support services (n = 80), (2) housing-only (n = 80), or (3) services as usual (SAU) (n = 80) and were re-assessed at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months postbaseline. Settings The study recruited a community-based sample from homeless service agencies and advertisements in a large Midwestern city. Participants The study recruited two hundred forty (N = 240) women between the ages of 18 to 24 years, experiencing homelessness and with a substance use disorder (SUD) who also had a biological child under the age of 6 years in their care. Measurements We measured frequency of alcohol and drug use using the Form 90 semi-structured interview, and self-efficacy using Pearlin and Schooler's (1978) 7-item Mastery Scale. Findings Overall, mothers showed significant improvement in substance use and self-efficacy over time in each condition. However, as expected, patterns of change differentiated intervention groups with more mothers showing better substance use and self-efficacy outcomes in housing + supportive services than in SAU. Unexpectedly, more mothers in SAU showed better outcomes than those in housing-only. Conclusions Substance use decreased and self-efficacy increased over time, but patterns of change characterized the intervention groups. In particular, findings suggest that when providing housing to this population, supportive services should also be offered.

AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of location on access to justice for vulnerable defendants seeking bail.Design/methodology/approachQualitative interviews were conducted with legal practitioners from rural, suburban and urban areas as part of a larger study into bail support services in Victoria, Australia.FindingsInterview participants identified a dearth of bail support resources in rural, regional and remote (RRR) areas compared to their urban counterparts. This dearth impacted negatively on some defendants’ outcomes in the justice system, particularly for young people and those experiencing homelessness.Practical implicationsThis study helps in improving policy through greater understanding of issues with RRR service provision; adds to knowledge for service providers on access to justice; highlights specific areas of concern for vulnerable populations; and provides a more nuanced understanding of location-based issues.Originality/valueThis research found that resourcing issues cannot be understood simply through an RRR/urban binary and that more complex factors impacting access to justice and access to services for vulnerable people should be incorporated into future analysis and policy development. This more nuanced understanding is useful across national and international contexts when developing policies to improve bail support service provision.

AB  - We recruited a cohort of 157 recent orphans and 480 non-orphans aged 9-15 in a region of high HIV/AIDS mortality in South Africa using stratified cluster sampling to determine the impact of recent parental death on health and food insecurity of school-going orphans compared to non-orphans over time. Between September 2004 and June 2007, household heads, caregivers, and children were interviewed at three annual intervals. Bivariate associations and multivariate models were assessed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). In the health domain, compared to non-orphans, double orphans were more likely to report worse health status and being very ill in the previous 12 months. For those who reported being very ill, maternal or paternal orphans were more than twice as likely not to seek care than non-orphans; no differences were found for double orphans. For nutrition and food insecurity, maternal or paternal orphans were more likely not to have eaten dinner and to have gone to bed hungry the previous night compared to non-orphans; no differences were found for double orphans. Overall, recent school-aged orphans were disadvantaged in health and food insecurity within two years after the death of a parent, compared to their non-orphaned counterparts, but the disparities were smaller than expected. No changes in health, nutritional status, or food insecurity were apparent over the three study rounds. Longer term effects into adulthood may well be more pronounced and warrant careful longitudinal investigation. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Children living in households that have recently become food insecure may be particularly vulnerable to adverse weight and dietary changes, but longitudinal studies examining these associations are lacking. Using data from 501 Head Start preschoolers from Michigan (48% male) who were followed during one school year as a part of a randomized obesity prevention trial, we examined changes in children's adiposity indices and dietary quality according to changes in household food insecurity. Household food insecurity change status was categorized as persistently food secure, became food secure, persistently food insecure, or became food insecure. Linear mixed effects models were used to estimate relative changes in BMI-for-age z scores (BAZ), triceps skinfolds-for-age z scores (TAZ), or diet quality (assessed with the 2010 Healthy Eating Index) over the school year according to food insecurity category. We found that girls from households that became food insecure over the year had a 0.21 unit higher gain in BAZ than girls from households that were persistently food secure, after adjustment for potential confounders (95% CI 0.02 to 0.39, p = 0.03). Girls from households that became food secure had improvements in dietary quality over the year compared to girls from persistently food insecure households (adjusted difference in Healthy Eating Index score change = 9.1 points; 95% CI 3.0 to 15.0; p = 0.003). There were no statistically significant associations with changes in TAZ. Among boys, there were no associations between changes in household food insecurity and changes in BAZ, TAZ, or dietary quality. In summary, we found that BMI and diet quality changes of Head Start preschool girls were correlated with short-term changes in household food insecurity. Continued research efforts should focus on identifying the most effective ways to promote the health of children in food insecure households, especially those who may have recently transitioned or are transitioning into food insecurity.

AB  - Purpose: Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) are vulnerable to multiple adverse health outcomes. Connecting YEH with housing is critical to addressing youth homelessness and to preventing long-term negative health consequences among this vulnerable population. Using administrative data, this study aims to explore correlates of YEH's sustainability in two major housing programs: permanent supportive housing (PSH) and rapid re-housing (RRH) programs. Methods: This study used Homelessness Management Information System administrative data collected from 16 communities across the U.S. between January 1, 2015 and May 1, 2017 (n = 10,902). We conducted Cox proportional hazards survival analyses to explore correlates (e.g., demographics, homeless experiences, and overall vulnerability) of YEH's PSH (n = 577) and RRH (n = 2,883) sustainability separately. Results: For YEH receiving PSH, only individuals' level of vulnerability is associated with greater hazard of exiting PSH. As for RRH sustainability, YEH who were 17 years old or younger, black or Latinx (as compared to white), of higher level of vulnerability, or previously spent most nights couch surfing or in transitional living programs (as compared to on the street) are associated with higher hazard of exiting RRH. Conclusions: Both PSH and RRH programs should incorporate comprehensive services targeting youth experiencing high vulnerability to prevent them from re-entering homelessness. Future RRH programming should also address housing sustainability disparities faced by racial and ethnic minority YEH, especially when they are disproportionately influenced by homelessness. Finally, RRH programs should incorporate services to foster independent living among younger YEH to sustain their housing status once temporary housing subsidies expire.

AB  - Female homeless youths are vulnerable to risky sex and substance use behaviors, yet they have strengths known as psychological capital. A quasi-experimental pre-post research design with repeated measures was used to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a brief intervention to enhance psychological capital, reduce health-risk behaviors, and achieve short-term behavioral goals. Study participants were 80 ethnically diverse homeless women between the ages of 18 and 23 years. Intervention participants had significant improvements in psychological capital, hope, resilience, and self-efficacy to refuse alcohol, social connectedness, and substance use (p< .05). There was a significant group by time interaction for safe sex self-efficacy; intervention participants had greater self-confidence in negotiating safer sex practices than comparison participants. At the follow-up post-test, 82% of intervention participants who remained in the study had met or exceeded their short-term goals. This brief, street-based intervention was feasible and showed preliminary efficacy.

AB  - We compared demographics, socioeconomic status, and food insecurity between households with and without recent orphans in a region of high HIV/AIDS mortality in South Africa. We recruited a cohort of 197 recent orphans and 528 non-orphans aged 9-15 years and their households using stratified cluster sampling. Households were classified into three groups: orphan-only (N = 50), non-orphan-only (N = 377), and mixed (N = 210). Between September 2004 and May 2007, households were interviewed three times regarding demographics, income and assets, and food insecurity. Baseline bivariate associations were assessed using chi-square test and t-test. Longitudinal bivariate associations and multivariate models were tested using generalized estimating equations. At baseline, mixed households generally exhibited greater characteristics of vulnerability than orphan-only and non-orphan-only households. They were larger, had older, less-educated household heads, and reported a much smaller annual per capita income. Orphan households were more likely to report a death in the previous year and less likely to have an adult employed. These differences persisted over the study. Even non-orphan-only households exhibited characteristics of vulnerability, with 14% reporting a death one year before baseline, 45% of whom were prime-age adults. At baseline, a much smaller proportion of orphan households reported receiving the child support grant than the other household types, but notably, there were no differences among households in receipt of the grant by Round 3. Household food insecurity was highly prevalent: more than one in five orphan-only and mixed households reported being food insecure in the previous month. These findings suggest that the effects of HIV/AIDS only exacerbate existing high levels of poverty in the district, as virtually all households are vulnerable regardless of orphan status. Community-level programs must help families address a spectrum of needs, including food security, caregiving, and financial support, as well as better target social welfare grants and make them more accessible to vulnerable households.

AB  - Follow-up rates reported among longitudinal studies that focus on runaway adolescents and their families are relatively low. Identifying factors associated with follow-up completion might be useful for improving follow-up rates and therefore study validity. The present study explored how individual- and family-level constructs, as well as research project activities, influence the follow-up completion rate among runaway adolescents (N=140) and their primary caregiver. Results showed that follow-up completion rates decreased as the number of research assistants (RA) assigned to each case increased and as participants' address changes increased. Additionally, among adolescents, more frequent alcohol use was associated with lower follow-up rates. The current findings suggest that researchers should (1) design their research so that one RA is assigned to each specific case, and (2) adjust their retention strategies to account for the differences in follow-up rates based upon the participants' drug of choice and residential stability.

AB  - Theoretical analyses by anthropologists suggest that food and water insecurity exhibit multiple conceptual parallels, hold similar consequences for wellbeing, and lead to analogous coping strategies aimed at mitigating those consequences. However, these deductions largely originate from studies conducted separately on either food or water insecurity. Thus, these similarities may not bear out when examined in populations facing high rates of both. In particular, some researchers argue that food and water insecurity exert independent but nonetheless iterative effects on mental wellbeing. Others hypothesize that food insecurity mediates the relationship between water insecurity and mental health, especially in agricultural communities. However, relevant studies are limited, and none test this hypothesis in urban areas. Moreover, no data exist on water insecurity and mental wellbeing in adolescents, which hampers comparative analyses of youth resource insecurity. In addition, resource buffering-a long-discussed coping strategy-remains contested with respect to food insecurity and effectively untested with respect to water insecurity. The buffering hypothesis suggests that adults cushion younger household members against resource inadequacies via tradeoffs that yield gender- and age-based disparities in intrahousehold resource distributions. For example, adults may forgo food quality, quantity, or variety in favor of children. It stands to reason that adults similarly buffer children against water scarcity, but, again, this has not been examined. Conducted December 2016-April 2017, this cross-sectional survey included 650 mothers, fathers, boys, and girls living in the slums of Jaipur, India. When controlling for food insecurity, the relationship between water insecurity and psychosocial stress (Perceived Stress Scale-10) was eliminated; water insecurity's effect on anxiety and depression (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-10) remained significant for fathers only. These findings are consistent with the mediation hypothesis. Moreover, pursuant to the buffering hypothesis, parents generally reported more severe resource scarcity than their children; however, girls reported slightly worse water insecurity than fathers.

The questions used in the assessment are illustrated by examples from conversations with the young people and their parents consulting the service, as well as reflections from the team of social workers who trialled the interview guide. The paper shows how working within existing governmental frameworks can still lead to conversations with clients that are respectful, generative, and hopeful.

AB  - Purpose No research has examined childbirth from a national perspective among females emancipating from foster care. The present study fills this gap by: (1) documenting the rates of initial and repeat births among females ages 17 and 19 in a national prospective study and (2) identifying risk and protective factors at age 17 that predict childbirth between ages 17 and 19. Methods This study used data from the National Youth in Transition Database and Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System to identify risk and protective factors associated with childbirth in a national sample of transition-age female youth (N = 3,474). Results The cumulative rate of childbirth by age 19 was 21%, with higher rates reported between ages 17 and 19 (17%; n = 602) compared with age 17 or earlier (9%; n = 313). In logistic regression analysis, black race and Hispanic ethnicity, placement with relatives, runaway status, trial home visit placement, early emancipation from foster care, and lifetime incarceration histories were associated with increased likelihood of childbirth. In contrast, school enrollment and employment skills were associated with decreased likelihood of childbirth. The multivariate odds of childbirth between ages 17 and 19 increased 10-fold if youth already had a child by age 17. Conclusions Sexual health and pregnancy prevention programs should specifically target youths who already have children. Increased attention should be paid to adolescents placed with biological families and those with histories of criminal involvement.

AB  - Assesses the ability of three models -- deviance-prone, affect-regulation, & normative development -- to predict adolescent substance abuse, drawing on scale data from 354 adolescents, ages 13-19, with high rates of deviance, depression, & substance use in Seattle, WA. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses that included tests for curvilinear & gender interaction effects were performed. Results supported the deviance-prone model most strongly, with delinquency, but not aggressive behavior, predicting substance use. The affect-regulation model received support for females but not for males. With respect to the normative development model, moderate substance users were no better off than abstainers in terms of negative affect or interpersonal relationships. 7 Tables, 2 Figures, 68 References.

AB  - The goal of the current study was to identify potential individual and environmental protective factors for sex risk behavior among homeless youth. We explored gender differences in the prediction of unprotected sex and number of sex partners. Data were collected from 192 sexually active, homeless youth who were 14 -21 years old. High rates of sex risk behavior were reported. Significant gender differences were found in STD rates with 19% of females and 2% of males reporting an STD diagnosis during the previous three months. Findings indicated that positive expectations for the future were associated with fewer sex partners for both genders, whereas decision making skills predicted a lower percentage of unprotected sex for males and fewer sex partners for females. For females, univariate analyses indicated that self-esteem and having a natural mentor may reduce the likelihood of unprotected sex, whereas multivariate analysis indicated that being employed or in school may play a protective role with respect to number of sex partners.

AB  - Background In recent years, crowdfunding for medical expenses has gained popularity, especially in countries without universal health coverage. Nevertheless, universal coverage does not imply covering all medical costs for everyone. In countries with universal coverage unmet health care needs typically emerge due to financial reasons: the inability to pay the patient co-payments, and additional and experimental therapies not financed by the health insurance fund. This study aims at mapping unmet health care needs manifested in medical crowdfunding campaigns in a country with universal health coverage.Methods In this exploratory study we assess unmet health care needs in Germany by investigating 380 medical crowdfunding campaigns launched on Leetchi.com. We combine manual data extraction with text mining tools to identify the most common conditions, diseases and disorders which prompted individuals to launch medical crowdfunding campaigns in Germany. We also assess the type and size of health-related expenses that individuals aim to finance from donations.Results We find that several conditions frequently listed in crowdfunding campaigns overlap with the most disabling conditions: cancer, mental disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and neurological disorders. Nevertheless, there is no strong association between the disease burden and the condition which prompted individuals to ask for donations. Although oral health, lipoedema, and genetic disorders and rare diseases are not listed among leading causes of disability worldwide, these conditions frequently prompted individuals to turn to crowdfunding. Unmet needs are the highest for various therapies not financed by the health insurance fund; additional, complementary, and animal-assisted therapies are high on the wish list. Numerous people sought funds to cover the cost of scientifically poorly supported or unsupported therapies. In line with the social drift hypothesis, disability and bad health status being associated with poor socioeconomic status, affected individuals frequently collected donations for their living expenses.Conclusions In universal healthcare systems, medical crowdfunding is a viable option to finance alternative, complementary, experimental and scientifically poorly supported therapies not financed by the health insurance fund. Further analysis of the most common diseases and disorders listed in crowdfunding campaigns might provide guidance for national health insurance funds in extending their list of funded medical interventions. The fact of numerous individuals launching crowdfunding campaigns with the same diseases and disorders signals high unmet needs for available but not yet financed treatment. One prominent example of such treatment is liposuction for patients suffering from lipoedema; these treatments were frequently listed in crowdfunding campaigns and might soon be available for patients at the expense of statutory health insurance in Germany.

AB  - Background Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) face significant obstacles to educational achievement and gainful employment. Drop-in centers offer support services to facilitate these opportunities, but there remains a need to understand which youth are most likely to use them. The present study used a diffusion of innovations framework to examine social network correlates of service use over a three-month period. Positive staff relationships, personal network exposure, and structural network measures were examined. Methods Participants were 253 YEH (Mage = 21.9, SD = 2.2) participating in an HIV-prevention trial at three drop-in centers in Los Angeles. Surveys were completed at baseline (wave 1), 1-month (wave 2) and 3-months (wave 3) post-baseline. Individual characteristics and sociometric network ties to other youth were assessed. Cross-sectional and lagged logistic regression models were used to identify significant network correlates of service use. Results A significant minority of YEH used education (23.6%) or employment (33.7%) services at wave 1, with modest increases at waves 2 and 3. Indegree centrality was associated with education service use at wave 1 (OR = 1.30, 95% CI[1.04, 1.64]). Positive staff relationships were associated with employment service use at wave 1 (OR = 2.05, 95% CI[1.06, 2.99]), and outdegree was associated with employment service use at wave 3 (OR = 1.69, 95% CI[1.13, 2.55]). In addition, education level, housing situation, LGBTQ+ identity, drop-in center location, and duration of drop-in center use were related to service usage. Conclusions Youth who occupy more central network positions and/or report positive relationships with staff are more likely to use higher-level drop-in services. Network approaches to engaging youth in services should be considered along with other individual and contextual factors.

AB  - To examine the differential effects of various forms of child abuse & maltreatment, as well as their combined effects, interview & scale data were collected from 329 homeless adolescents, sampled from drop-in centers in Seattle/King County, WA. Preliminary analyses indicated some degree of matching for family background variables. Any differences in demographic or family characteristics were controlled for statistically. Chi-square analyses revealed significant differences across groups for rates of assault, rape, depression/dysthymia, & attempted suicide. Multivariate analyses indicated significant differences in severity of internalizing problems & cognitive problems. Without exception, those with histories of both physical & sexual abuse exhibited the most severe symptomatology & were at greater risk for revictimization. Multiple regression analyses suggested that abuse histories were predictive of internalizing problems, while family characteristics were more predictive of externalizing problems. Findings indicate that both abuse type & family characteristics contribute to the development of symptomatology. Future prospective & longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the sequelae of abuse, as well as the possible cause & effect relations between abuse, family characteristics, & psychological outcomes. 5 Tables, 1 Figure, 77 References.

AB  - This study explored gender differences, sexual self-concept and life on the street among homeless adolescents who self-reported a history of sexual abuse. Individual interviews were conducted with 13 adolescents (six males and seven females) aged 18-20 years. There were salient themes shared by both males and females (vulnerability, sexual harassment, survival sex), and one theme specific to bisexual adolescents. Both males and females described aspects of their vulnerability related to being male or female. More than half the participants also described incidents of sexual harassment. In addition, both males and females stated that females needed the protection of males. Only one theme specific to youth with a bisexual orientation emerged related to the advantages of being bisexual. The findings indicate that sexual maturation takes place within the context of social and cognitive changes that can profoundly influence an individual's ability to develop a healthy sexual self-concept, including sexual awareness, sexual assertiveness, sexual self-efficacy, sexual esteem, sexual satisfaction and motivation to avoid risky sex. Further exploration related to sexual self-concept, the prevalence of sexual abuse and the impact of a sexual abuse history on the street life of homeless adolescents is warranted.

AB  - Aim:This article documents the impact of a Nurse Practitioner-led primary health service for disadvantaged children living in housing instability or homelessness. It identifies that First Nations children miss out on essential primary care, particularly immunisation, but have less severe health conditions than non-First Nations children living in housing insecurity.Background:Health services for homeless populations focus on the 11% of rough sleepers, little is done for the 22% of children in Australia living in housing instability; many of whom are from First Nations families. Little is known of the health status of these children or their connections to appropriate primary health care.Methods:This research implemented an innovative model of extended health care delivery, embedding a Nurse Practitioner in a homeless service to work with families providing health assessments and referrals, using clinically validated assessment tools. This article reports on proof of concept findings on the service that measured immunisation rates, developmental, medical, dental and mental health needs of children, particularly First Nations children, using a three-point severity level scale with Level 3 being the most severe and in need of immediate referral to a specialist medical service.Findings:Forty-three children were referred by the service to the Nurse Practitioner over a 6-month period, with nine identifying as First Nations children. Differences in severity levels between First Nations/non-First Nations children were Level 1, First Nations/non-First Nations 0/15%; Level 2, 10/17%; and Level 3, 45/29%. Forty-five percent of First Nations children had no health problems, as compared to 29% on non-First Nations children. Immunisation rates were low for both cohorts. No First Nations child was immunised and only 9% of the non-First Nations children. While numbers for both cohorts are too low for valid statistical analysis, the lower levels of severity for First Nations children suggest stronger extended family support and the positive impact of cultural norms of reciprocity.

AB  -  The Food Stamp Program (FSP) is a cornerstone of the food assistance safety net's efforts to reduce household food insecurity, particularly among children. We examine the dynamic relationship between FSP participation and child food insecurity using monthly measures from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, rather than annual measures. Findings demonstrate that child food insecurity increases in the months immediately prior to FSP entrance but then partially recovers in the following months. These dynamic FSP effects are masked when annual measures are employed.

AB  -  The phenomenon of street children could have gender-specific aspects. The cultural hypothesis emphasises the fact that the social roles assigned to boys and girls lead to gender-based differences in the way that the process of migration onto the street is viewed. The validity of this hypothesis is tested using data on street children in Mauritania. Our study analyses the family background of the children. The results support this hypothesis.

AB  - The primary aim of this study was to describe the abuse experiences of sexually exploited runaway adolescents seen at a Child Advocacy Center (N = 62). We also sought to identify risk behaviors, attributes of resiliency, laboratory results for sexually transmitted infection (STI) screens, and genital injuries from colposcopic exams. We used retrospective mixed-methods with in-depth forensic interviews, together with self-report survey responses, physical exams and chart data. Forensic interviews were analyzed using interpretive description analytical methods along domains of experience and meaning of sexual exploitation events. Univariate descriptive statistics characterized trauma responses and health risks. The first sexual exploitation events for many victims occurred as part of seemingly random encounters with procurers. Older adolescent or adult women recruited some youth working for a pimp. However, half the youth did not report a trafficker involved in setting up their exchange of sex for money, substances, or other types of consideration. 78% scored positive on the UCLA PTSD tool; 57% reported DSM IV criteria for problem substance use; 71% reported cutting behaviors, 75% suicidal ideation, and 50% had attempted suicide. Contrary to common depictions, youth may be solicited relatively quickly as runaways, yet exploitation is not always linked to having a pimp. Avoidant coping does not appear effective, as most patients exhibited significant symptoms of trauma. Awareness of variations in youth's sexual exploitation experiences may help researchers and clinicians understand potential differences in sequelae, design effective treatment plans, and develop community prevention programs.

AB  - SummaryThis article describes caregivers' strategies for reaching children on the streets and caring for them at institutions of care. Data was collected over a period of two years from 70 caregivers in 35 organisations in Nairobi, Nakuru and Muranga, identified by snowball sampling strategy. Data was collected using a semi-structured topic guide based on issues emerging from earlier studies with street boys. Direct observation, video recording and photography were used to study interactions between the children and their caregivers.FindingsTwo themes were developed: the "dedicated" caregiver confronting street realities, and making a difference despite the limitations. The way caregivers interacted with the children on the streets and in the institutions influenced the children's decision to leave the streets, to be initiated into residential care, and attend rehabilitation and reintegration programmes. Children were more positive to caregivers who took time to understand them and were soft in establishing rapport with them.ApplicationThe results suggest that caregivers' strategies are potential contributors to reversing trends in the street children phenomenon as they influence the children's decision to leave the streets and undergo rehabilitation at institutions of care. We thus recommend development of educational efforts focusing on helping caregivers develop healthy relationships and positive interactions with the children.

AB  - Estudio transversal cuyo objetivo fue determinar la calidad de vida relacionada con la salud (CVRS) en 92 niños y adolescentes, entre los 8 y los 18 años de edad, que vivían en un hogar temporal de un municipio colombiano. Se aplicaron pruebas para la diferencia de promedios, de correlación y se construyó un modelo logístico con el fin de identificar los factores que se asociaron al desenlace, la CVRS. No se encontraron diferencias entre los promedios del puntaje de la CVRS según sexo (p = 0.094) y además estos en las dimensiones actividad física y salud, sentimientos, autopercepción, autonomía, vida familiar, relación con los pares y entorno escolar fueron mayores que el promedio de la CVRS; ser mujer y haber sufrido algún tipo de limitación, influyen en tener puntajes de la CVRS menores de 70 puntos.

AB  - Sampling methods to study street children often rely on convenience approaches. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a relatively new methodology for sampling hard-to-reach populations utilizing peer-driven recruitment. It includes both field and analytical procedures to account for non-random recruitment patterns and generates statistically valid samples. This article describes RDS and assesses its effectiveness to recruit a diverse sample of street children, defined as children aged 10-17 years who engage in economic activity on the street in Tirana, Albania. This is the first publication on the use of RDS among street children. This article describes the demographic profile of street children and assesses whether they are sufficiently networked to justify the use of RDS as a sampling approach. Beginning with 10 initial recruits, 293 street children were recruited within 9 weeks. The sample included children of various ethnicities and principal work activities, as well as those with both a short and long history of street work. Males greatly outnumbered females (93.9% vs. 6.1%) and 20.6% of children reported sometimes sleeping away from home. Children had dense social network ties, irrespective of whether they slept at home every day. They also formed social networks related to ethnicity and type of work, but less so with respect to gender. Examination of recruitment patterns revealed important biases that may exist in other methods utilized to study this population. The importance of analytical adjustments applied in RDS is also demonstrated. RDS could be an important breakthrough for researchers and policymakers, providing a more accurate profile of street children's characteristics. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This research examined the impact of including a supportive person on the outcomes of two culturally sensitive AIDS education programs, an education-only (traditional) program and a program combining education with self-esteem and coping enhancement (specialized). Research participants in this quasi-experimental study included 241 homeless women, who were randomly assigned by residence (drug treatment program or shelter) to one of four treatment groups. The outcomes measured at baseline, 6, and 12 months were risk behaviors, cognitive factors, and psychological functioning. Study results demonstrated significant improvements at both 6 and 12 months for the entire sample in all psychological, behavioral and cognitive outcome variables except active coping. Women in the specialized program improved more on AIDS knowledge and reduction in non-injection drug use than did those in the traditional program, but their active coping scores declined. Participation of a supportive person did not appear to have any effect on outcome.

AB  - The study tests the short-term impact on housing stability of the Family Unification Program (FUP), a permanent housing program for child welfare-involved families at risk of separation from children due to inadequate housing. Families eligible for FUP (n = 150) received housing case management services as usual, and half were referred for permanent housing vouchers made available through FUP. Families referred for FUP secured more enriched home learning environments, while more precariously housed families exhibited greater housing stability when referred for FUP. The intervention did not relate with housing affordability or improvements in neighborhood quality. Findings suggest benefits of FUP-especially for more vulnerable families-in key areas that support child development; however, families continue to struggle in the context of poverty.

AB  - Purpose: This study is an outcome evaluation of Cottage Housing Incorporated's Serna Village Program (CHI), a supportive housing program serving homeless families in Sacramento, California. Methods: This quasi-experimental study examined a sample of 293 children and youth who lived with their parents in CHI between 2002 and 2009. Results: 71% of the children had a history of foster care before CHI; 10% of the youth reentered foster care after graduating from CHI (compared with reentry rates of 20-40% from other studies). The CHI youth overall spent less time in care after foster care reentry when compared to other Sacramento County youth. Child welfare costs of the sample before entering CHI were $1,313,262, yet at reentry, child welfare costs were $295,632 (2.5 to 5 years after leaving CHI). Conclusions: Child welfare recidivism rates and total child welfare costs after reentry may decrease for homeless families by providing them with permanent housing and support services.

AB  - PURPOSEThis study explored differences between lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB)‐housed and homeless students regarding substance use patterns on and off school grounds and the unique contribution of homelessness to substance use in school.METHODSData were from the 2013‐2015 California Healthy Kids Survey, a statewide survey of school protective factors and risk behaviors. A representative sample of 9th‐ and 11th‐grade students (N = 20,337) was used. Comparisons between housed (n = 19,456) and homeless (doubled up: n = 715; acute homeless: n = 166) LGB students were conducted. We used chi‐square tests to compare rates of lifetime, past‐30‐day, and in‐school substance use and conducted multivariate logistic regression models for each substance use variables.RESULTSChi‐square test results indicated significant differences in rates of substance use among students experiencing homelessness (both categories) and housed LGB students. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual students experiencing homelessness were more likely to report substance use off and on school grounds. Results from logistic regression analyses indicated that LGB students who experience homelessness were significantly more likely to report recent and in‐school substance use. For example, students experiencing acute homelessness were about 3 times as likely to report heavy episodic drinking (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.13, 4.26) and more than 5 times as likely to smoke marijuana in school (AOR = 5.38; 95% CI = 3.46, 8.36), compared to housed LGB students.CONCLUSIONSLGB students who experience homelessness are at higher risk than housed LGB students of substance use on and off school grounds. Findings highlight the need to provide support in the school context for this subpopulation.

The AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) pandemic is inextricably linked to homelessness & is a particularly devasting threat to the welfare of the world's disenfranchised youth. Here, specific recommendations regarding clinical care, prevention programs, & research, & implications for policy & legislative action, are discussed in relation to reducing the incidence & impact of the human immunodeficiency virus. The provision of AIDS education & prevention for street children within the context of health care services is emphasized, particularly by the promotion & training of physicians & other health professionals in street-based care. 55 References.

AB  - This study examined the HIV risk behaviors and life experiences of 151 transgender female youth, ages 15--24, in Los Angeles and Chicago. Descriptive analyses and logistic regression modeling were used to identify life factors associated with ever having engaged in sex work. Sixty-seven percent of participants had ever engaged in sex work and 19% self-reported being HIV positive. Many factors were significantly associated with sex work for this sample population. A final multivariate logistic regression model found that lower education status, homelessness, use of street drugs, and perceived social support remained significantly associated with sex work when controlling for other factors. Findings highlight the complex HIV risk environment and suggest a need for sex work initiation research for transgender female youth. HIV prevention efforts for this population need to include broad-based approaches that take into account individual, social, and community-level factors relevant to the lives of transgender female youth.

AB  - This paper examines the association between food stamp program participation and bodyweight among 1,723 eligible women who were respondents of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Cohort. The study sample was stratified by race/ethnicity and two time periods, i.e., 1987-1996, 1998-2002, to allow for genetic and cultural differences and a potential structural break due to the 1996 welfare reform. We test a hypothesis based on the nutrigenomic literature suggesting that genetic heterogeneities result in varying effects of nutrition or food-borne components on metabolism. Differences in socioeconomic characteristics between participants and eligible non-participants were identified. We find a positive association between food stamp program participation and bodyweight among Hispanic women, particularly those of foreign-born. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The study examined differences in produce intake by food security status of adult mothers aged 18 and older with young children living on Prince Edward Island (PEI) and using Family Resource Centre services. Validated measures of household adult food security and produce intake/related behaviors were utilized. Participants (n = 282) were primarily white (n = 262, 92.9%) and married (n = 164, 58.2%). Age ranged from 18 to 53 years (30 ± 5 years, n = 280). Regarding household adult food security (n = 281), 168 (59.6%) experienced food security during the previous 12 months, and 113 (40.1%) experienced food insecurity (food insecure-marginal [n = 29, 10.3%]; food insecure-moderate [n = 46, 16.4%]; food insecure-severe [n = 38, 13.5%]). Total produce (P < .001), fruit (P < .001), and vegetable (P = .001) differed by household adult food security; mothers who experienced severe food insecurity consumed less total produce than food secure or food insecure-moderate mothers by 1.8 and 1.3 servings daily, respectively. Mothers of young children living on PEI who experienced severe food insecurity had lower produce intake compared to other mothers. Further exploration of programs and services to improve food insecurity among these mothers is warranted.

AB  - Adolescent street boys are a highly mobile population and difficult to reach. They are recognized to be vulnerable to substance, physical and sexual abuse. Our objective was to conduct a study among adolescent street boys of Mumbai City to assess substance, physical and sexual abuse and the factors associated with them. Most of the studies on adolescent street boys were conducted either in observation homes or via surveys, but we have adopted a unique approach in which a cross-sectional study was conducted in a 3-day Diwali Festival Mela, an annual celebration when these adolescent street boys come from almost all areas of Mumbai City in large numbers. During this period they are relaxed and provide confidential information in privacy; the response rate was 83.5%. Of 163 street boys, 132 (80.98%) were substance abusers; 52 (31.9%) had been sexually abused and 87 (53.3%) had been physically abused. The most common reasons for substance abuse or the perceived functions of substance use mentioned by participants were peer pressure (62.1%), experimentation (36.3%) or to boost self-confidence (28.7%). Almost three-quarters (70 %) of all substance users wanted to quit and about 40% had tried to quit. A multiple logistic regression statistical method was used in which increasing age, family pathology, substance abuse among peers and those who were living only on-street were at a greater risk of substance abuse (P < 0.05), while concerning sexual abuse the above factors were not statistically significant (P> 0.05). Those adolescent street boys with family pathology were at more risk of physical abuse, with a statistical significance of P < 0.05. This study will help in the intervention and evaluation of programmes intended for a most elusive population at extreme risk for various abuses and its adverse consequences.

AB  - To effectively combat the AIDS health crisis among adolescents, future research must address three key issues: (a) the risk of disease for culturally differing adolescent populations, particularly African-American adolescents; (b) the need for empirical investigations to identify and understand the variables influencing adolescents 'adoption of HIV-preventive sexual practices; and (c) the development of more effective prevention programs to reduce adolescents' existing HIV-associated risk behaviors. This article reviews the relevance of these issues for prevention research and suggests policy recommendations. These recommendations argue for: (a) expanded funding for basic behavioral surveys to identify the prevalence of risk-taking behavior among adolescents in general, and among high-risk adolescent subgroups, for example, incarcerated and homeless adolescents; (b) encouraging more epidemiologic and ethnographic research to understand the psychosocial and cultural variables associated with high and low-risk behavior among understudied and underserved racial/ethnic populations such as African-American adolescents; and (c) urging that evaluation of HIV prevention programs include multisite trials and larger samples in ethnically and geographically diverse populations.

AB  - This systematic review explores empirical research published between 2002 and 2012 regarding the effectiveness of prevention programs for intimate partner violence. To assess whether and to what extent programs might be applicable to implementation with a homeless youth population, we categorize studies as being tested with the general youth population or with at-risk youth populations. Quality of the research is assessed by comparing participant selection, study design, assessment instruments, and program outcomes. Applicability to homeless youth is assessed by examining setting, participants, curriculum, duration of intervention, target outcomes, measures and instruments, and results. After retrieving abstracts from various databases using search words that reflected our research questions, we identified 14 studies that met the review inclusion criteria. Of the 14 programs reviewed, 7 were implemented with the general youth population and 7 programs were implemented with "at-risk" youth. Although some programs show sufficient promise to warrant further research (e.g., efficacy and effectiveness trials), whether these programs can be adapted to fit the needs of homeless youth remains unclear. Therefore, preventing intimate partner violence among homeless youth might require efforts to develop a new intervention that not only meets the needs of homeless youth but also meets the needs of those providing services for homeless youth.

Findings from this study suggest the efficacy of Family Finding in establishing relational permanence for youth. Findings from qualitative analyses indicate that Family Finders modified the actual steps of the model. Both youth-recommended and Family Finders-recommended Family Finding services begin when children and youth enter child welfare. However, quantitative findings suggest there is not any significant difference in Family Finding outcomes for younger and older youth.

AB  - Many women become homeless each year, both women who are alone and women with children. Both groups face substantial risks to their physical and mental health, as do the children of homeless mothers. Little is known about the similarities and differences between these two groups in terms of their demographic characteristics, their circumstances on presentation to specialist homelessness services, and the factors that have contributed to their homelessness. The current study analysed data from 163 single mothers with children and 126 lone women who presented to a specialist homelessness service in Australia. It found some similarities between groups, but also considerable heterogeneity. Single mothers were more likely to be younger, to have been born overseas, and to have been homeless in the past 12 months. Lone women were more likely to have medical issues, a mental health condition, addiction issues, admission to a psychiatric ward in the past 12 months, and to not be in the labour force. Implications for service delivery are discussed.

AB  - In this article, I explore how different groups of the precariat endure and struggle with specific and hierarchical forms of precarity in Seoul. By paying attention to which precarity matters, and to whom it belongs, I examine the friction between the educated youth—the “deserving” precariat that can speak—and the urban poor, who endure abandonment. This collaborative project, in which university students encountered welfare recipients and homeless people through interviews with antipoverty activists, unveils the complex reality that one group’s attempt to react to their precarity risks marginalizing or exacerbating the precarity faced by another group. The affective discourses of fairness and security, which are often embodied and fetishized by precarious youth who are struggling to survive, turn out to have fostered a deeper marginalization and criminalization of the urban poor. Instead of reducing this finding to a critique of the differential distribution of precarity, I reposition my ethnography as an experimental and pedagogical project, in which an anthropologist’s “field” is created with the expansion of research inquiries, findings, reflections, and actions. As such, ethnography serves as a kind of activism to connect the bounded circles of the precariat and demonstrate new predicaments and possibilities in an open-ended manner.

AB  - This study uses geocoded address data and information about parents' economic behavior and children's development from four random-assignment welfare and anti-poverty experiments conducted during the 1990s. We find that the impacts of these welfare and anti-poverty programs on boys' and girls' developmental outcomes during the transition to early adolescence differ as a function of neighborhood poverty levels. The strongest positive impacts of these programs are among boys who lived in high-poverty neighborhoods at the time their parents enrolled in the studies, with smaller or nonstatistically significant effects for boys in lower-poverty neighborhoods and for girls across all neighborhoods. This research informs our understanding of how neighborhood context and child gender may interact with employment-based policies to affect children's well-being. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the Foster Care Independence Act (FCIA) of 1999 and its impact on the outcomes faced by former foster youth after emancipating from care. Given that former foster youth continue to experience issues of homelessness, lack of education, unemployment and incarceration, David Gil's framework was used to analyze the objectives, values and the effects of the FCIA. This policy emphasized the importance of self-sufficiency and permanency. Although it encouraged support through mentors or dedicated adults, biological family involvement was excluded. Not only did emancipated youth continue to experience poor outcomes after passage but it was also found that many eligible youth were not receiving available services. It is recommended to implement a tracking system to ensure that services are being provided to all eligible youth. Lastly, more research and evaluations of current programs are essential to work toward improvement of programs and outcomes.

AB  - Primary education in Vietnam is free and compulsory for five years. The majority of school-aged children continue into lower secondary school, but significant numbers drop out. This study investigated the health and social situation of adolescents aged 11-16 years (between primary education and legal employment age) to compare the situation of adolescents in school with those working, including possible gender differences. The data were collected by questionnaire on a randomly selected sample of adolescents, aged 11-16 years, living in Hanoi. A total of 1547 adolescents were interviewed. Adolescents from Hanoi were healthy, continuing their education, lived with parents, and only a few reported behaviour detrimental to their health. They knew about HIV, but their knowledge about prevention was poor. The working adolescents had moved to Hanoi to earn an income. The girls were staying mainly with relatives, while the boys lived with employers or in rented rooms. Very few were homeless and these were exposed to more risks to their health due to a more risky lifestyle and less knowledge about HIV prevention. For urban adolescents, their right to education, basic health and to be cared for by their parents was fulfilled. More of the rural adolescents had left school early, were responsible for their own daily life and were exposed to greater risks and a more risky lifestyle. The living and working conditions of these rural adolescents need further investigation and action to ensure their rights to welfare, development and health are met. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The objective of this article is to analyze the relationship between suffering from stressful life events (SLE) and subsequent suicidal behavior among women in a homeless situation, examining the differences in the number and characteristics of SLE experienced by attempters and nonattempters. The study was carried out based on the data obtained from a sample of women living homeless in Madrid (Spain; n = 138). The information was gathered using a structured interview. The results show that 46% of these women living homeless in Madrid had attempted suicide, and 32% of them had done so for the first time when they were homeless. We observed a high level of SLE among the women in a homeless situation, with a substantial increase in the number and severity of the stressors suffered by the interviewees who had attempted suicide, both during their childhood and adolescence and in their later lives.

AB  - While there is a growing body of research on intimate partner violence (IPV) experienced by the housed youth population, a limited amount is known about IPV experienced by homeless youth. To our knowledge, no previous studies have examined how homeless youths' experience of IPV is related to their social network, even though the social networks of homeless youth have been shown to be significant indicators of health and mental health. The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship between IPV, gender, and social networks among a sample of 386 homeless youth in Los Angeles, California. Results revealed that one fifth of the sample experienced IPV in the past year. Stratified regression models revealed that IPV was not significantly related to any measure of male social networks; however, females who experienced IPV had more male friends (β = 2.03, SE = 0.89, p < .05) than females who did not experience IPV. Female homeless youth who witnessed family violence during childhood had more male friends (β = 2.75, SE = 1.08, p < .05), but those who experienced sexual abuse during childhood had fewer male friends (β = -2.04, SE = 0.93, p < .05). Although there was no significant difference in the rate of IPV victimization across genders, the context of this abuse appears to be drastically different. The results suggest that females with more male friendships are at greater risk for exposure to IPV. To date, there are few effective youth-targeted IPV prevention programs and none have been shown to be effective with homeless youth. These results provide insight into future program development.

These urban street children face struggles at every turn. They are exposed to hazardous cultural practices like drug use, sexual exploitation, & crime. This environment negatively affects the development of propositional logic & identity. These youth rarely have the chance to experiment with more positive identities or envision a future as full human beings. Intervention programs need to address these realities & provide alternatives.

AB  - Although a substantial body of literature demonstrates high prevalence of street victimization among homeless youth, few studies have investigated the existence of victimization classes that differ on the type and frequency of victimization experienced. Nor do we know how substance use patterns relate to victimization classes. Using latent class analysis (LCA), we examined the existence of victimization classes of homeless youth and investigated substance use predictors of class membership utilizing a large purposive sample (N = 601) recruited from homeless youth-serving host agencies in three disparate regions of the U.S. Results of the LCA suggest the presence of three distinct victimization profiles -- youth fit into a low-victimization class, a witness class, or a high-victimization class. These three victimization classes demonstrated differences in their substance use, including rates of substance abuse/dependence on alcohol and/or drugs. The presence of distinct victimization profiles suggests the need for screening and referral for differential services. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - A large administrative data set allows us to examine shelter use by single adults, youth, and families in Toronto. We find important differences in shelter use by single adults, youth, and families. We introduce an approach that allows us to identify a noticeable increase in the percentage of shelter clients whom we define as chronic users of the shelter system-people for whom each episode of shelter use is typically very long. This should be a concern because chronic users of the system, although they make up only a small fraction of all shelter clients, fill more than 40 percent of shelter capacity. A growing number of chronic shelter users will strain the ability of the shelter system to provide shelter to those seeking temporary relief while they re-establish themselves into housing. Homeless shelters are a response to a serious social problem. They are not the cause of nor are they the solution to that problem. Growing shelter use is an indication of a social order in trouble.

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk characteristics & sources of HIV information were examined during 1992-1994 interviews with 430 sexually active street youths recruited in Seattle, WA. The majority (80%) reported having multiple sex partners in the prior 30 days. Condom use was reported more frequently for nonmain vs main partners. Some 33+% had injected drugs, & almost all reported use of alcohol or other substances. Basic HIV knowledge & recent exposure to information were relatively high. The most frequently mentioned channels of information were small media (eg, brochures, flyers), followed by interpersonal & mass media sources; street-based small media were received by 63% of the sample & were the only specific source of HIV information to reach 50+% of the youths. Significant differences in sources of information were observed for gender & homeless status. Information exposure via small media channels was postively associated with several psychosocial variables pertaining to condom use with main sex partners, while exposure to any source was not related to variables associated with condom use with nonmain partners. Implications for prevention campaigns targeting street youth are discussed. 6 Tables, 29 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - In this paper we present national estimates of the association between the housing circumstances of young Australian families and the developmental outcomes of children aged between 4 and 9 years old using the third wave of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). We find large differences in measures of both receptive vocabulary and emotional and behavioural problems according to the housing tenure of childrens families with children in public housing displaying the worst outcomes. We also find evidence that residential mobility adversely affects the outcomes of some children. Interestingly, we do not find that housing stress, as measured by the 30/40 rule, has any association with the developmental outcomes of children after taking into account the low household incomes of these families.

AB  - Homeless women are very different from homeless men, but few studies have reported data separately on them or compared them directly with men. This report on a study of 600 homeless men and 300 homeless women in St. Louis presents comparison data on these populations. The pivotal difference between homeless men and women was that unlike men, most women had young children in their custody. The women were also younger than men, more likely to be members of a minority group, and more often dependent on welfare. They had been homeless for a shorter period and spent less time in unsheltered locations. Compared to men, they had less frequent histories of substance abuse, incarceration, and felony conviction. Solitary women (without children with them), compared to women with children in their custody, were more likely to be white, had been homeless longer, and more often had a history of alcoholism or schizophrenia. On most variables, values for solitary women lay somewhere between those for men and for women with children. The population of homeless women is therefore heterogeneous, with at least two subgroups. These groups are likely to benefit from intervention programs that are designed to address their specific problems and needs, which are not necessarily the same as those of homeless men.

AB  - IntroductionHomelessness and mental illness are associated with poor service engagement, health and health service use outcomes. Existing literature suggests that financial incentives may effectively support service engagement of this population, but studies investigating key stakeholder perspectives are lacking. This study aimed to elicit, using qualitative methods, nuanced service user and provider experiences by using financial incentives to support service engagement among adults experiencing homelessness and mental illness.MethodsThis qualitative study is part of a larger mixed‐methods pragmatic trial of financial incentives (Coordinated Access to Care for the Homeless—Financial Incentives [CATCH‐FI]) within a community‐based brief case management programme (CATCH) in Toronto, Ontario. Twenty‐two CATCH‐FI participants were purposefully recruited to participate in in‐depth, semi‐structured interviews; five CATCH service providers participated in a focus group and seven key informants in individual interviews. Data collection occurred between April 2019 and December 2020. All interviews and the focus group were audio‐recorded and transcribed. Topic guides prompted participant perspectives on and experiences of using financial incentives to support engagement, health and well‐being. Grounded theory and inductive thematic analysis guided coding and interpretation of transcripts. Triangulation and member‐checking enhanced the analytical rigour and validity of findings.ResultsCATCH service providers, key informants and subgroup of CATCH‐FI participants perceived financial incentives to directly facilitate service engagement. The majority of CATCH‐FI participants however highlighted that intrinsic motivation and service quality may be relatively more important facilitators of engagement. Most study participants across stakeholder groups perceived that financial incentives have direct positive influences on health and well‐being in enabling access to basic needs and simple pleasures.ConclusionsOur data suggest that for some adults experiencing homelessness and mental illness, financial incentives can directly support service engagement. In addition, financial incentives may positively impact health and well‐being by easing financial stress and enabling deeper attention to individual health needs. Further research on the effectiveness and acceptability of financial incentives is needed to improve understanding and uptake of a promising intervention to support health and health service use outcomes in an underserved population.Patient or Public ContributionStudy participants provided input into the study research questions, study design, interview guides and interpretation of findings.

The social exclusion framework from Murray (2007)was used to examine the correlates of parental incarceration for youth who themselves are incarcerated. Cluster analysis identified 10 factors that showed significant differences among low, medium, and high rates of parental incarceration. These factors were associated with negative life events, parental substance abuse, experience with public assistance and/or foster care, neighborhood quality and instability, stigma, and negative youth outcomes.

Both addressees' affiliations & distribution location were associated with returned responses, with the lowest rates being for the Prevent Lesbian Homelessness Program affiliate overall & for the city of Pensacola, respectively. Antigay prejudice toward a deviant group may still be strong even when a helping act can be performed without intimate contact involving members of a deviant group. Neither distribution location, nor the sender, or return address conditions were associated with different returned responses. Further testing of the lost letter technique, as a measure of public response, may be warranted. 1 Table, 25 References. Adapted from the source document.

A model for identifying risk antecedents & marks is proposed, including family dysfunction, poverty, quality of neighborhood, school performance & grade retention, out-of-home placement/foster care, problem behavior, early sexual behavior, homelessness, running away, substance abuse, & criminal behavior. The outcomes that are injurious to the youth's development into productive adults include: sexually transmitted diseases; adolescent morbidity & mortality due to accidents, homicide, & suicide; & chronic problem behavior. Current barriers that impede programs aimed at prevention are federal funding structures & eligibility guidelines. Three programs are outlined in TN, CO, & TX, states that emphasize comprehensive service-integration strategies. 66 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This study reports the mental health outcomes of a small randomized clinical trial (n = 60) that compared housing and supportive services (Ecologically-Based Treatment, EBT) to community based housing and support services (treatment as usual, TAU). Mothers receiving EBT, but not those receiving TAU, reported reductions in their children's behavioral health problems. Reductions in mothers' mental health problems and intimate partner violence were observed in both TAU and EBT. The current findings provide evidence supporting the efficacy of independent housing and integrated support services. Given that EBT showed similar, and in some cases superior findings to TAU, EBT may be an effective alternative for communities that do not have shelters available for those families experiencing homelessness.

AB  - The purpose of this dissertation was to better understand the psychosocial problems (mental health problems, substance use problems, and sexual risk behaviors) and the associated contextual risk factors by comparing homeless sexual minority youths with their heterosexual counterparts. This study used an ecological perspective (Bronfenbrenner, 1989) and a risk and protective factors framework (Hawkins, Catalano, & Miller, 1992) to identify contextual risk factors at the microsystem, mesosystem, and macrosystem levels that are associated with the psychosocial problems of homeless sexual minority and homeless heterosexual youths. Individuals aged 16-24 were recruited from three drop-in programs serving homeless youths in downtown Toronto (N=147). Structured interviews were conducted with each participant. Bivariate analyses indicated statistically significant differences between homeless sexual minorities (n=66) and their heterosexual counterparts (n=81) regarding mental health, substance use and sexual risk behaviors, as well as contextual factors such as peers, family communication, stigma, and discrimination with sexual minority youths faring more poorly. Results of multiple regression analyses indicated that sexual identity moderated the relationship between negative peers and three psychosocial behaviors: sexual risk behaviors, condom use and substance use. Among sexual minorities, having peers who engaged in negative behaviors was associated with increased risky behaviors, but for homeless heterosexual youths, there was no effect between negative peers and their sexual risk behaviors and substance use. Results also indicated that sexual identity did not moderate the relationship between other contextual factors (i.e., family communication, stigma, or discrimination) and psychosocial outcomes such as mental health, substance use, and sexual risk behaviors. Understanding the nature and direction of the differences between homeless sexual minority youths and their heterosexual counterparts is an important first step in reducing disparities regarding negative outcomes of this population of youths.

AB  - Finding fulfillment of basic psychological needs may be difficult for parents living in shelters after becoming homeless or after escaping violence. This study tested if experiencing nature was associated with the basic psychological needs of parents in shelters. Need satisfaction and need frustration were measured among parents in shelters (N = 160), with one measurement in the standard indoor context of the shelter and one measurement while experiencing nature. Experiencing nature was associated with enhanced need satisfaction (d = 0.28) and reduced need frustration (d = −0.24). The effect was especially pronounced for parents with young children. Our findings suggest that the physical environment matters for parents’ basic psychological need fulfillment as they interact with their children in the context of sheltering. This finding opens a potential avenue for supporting parental functioning and resilience in the face of risk if these effects were to be replicated across settings using controlled experimental designs. At the very least, the findings may be discussed with practitioners and parents in the context of making shelter life and work more conducive to mental health and family functioning.

AB  - Studies of children's perceptions have shown that self-esteem is an important factor in their social & school performance & that, over time, low self-esteem is at the root of much problematic behavior among adolescents. This study focuses on children in poverty, adding a home domain dimension absent in most self-esteem scales, & examining gender differences. The study findings show that a process of discounting exists between home & school domains & self-worth gender comparisons show a significant deficit for girls. These results contradict previous research that place the onset of deterioration of girls' self-esteem at an older age. The praxis implications of this exploratory research on the intersection of poverty, age, & gender are discussed. 4 Tables, 81 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This paper has two purposes. First, it documents the historical context of MINCOME, a Canadian guaranteed annual income field experiment (1974 to 1979). Second, it uses routinely collected health administration data and a quasi-experimental design to document an 8.5 percent reduction in the hospitalization rate for participants relative to controls, particularly for accidents and injuries and mental health. We also found that participant contacts with physicians declined, especially for mental health, and that more adolescents continued into grade 12. We found no increase in fertility, family dissolution rates, or improved birth outcomes. We conclude that a relatively modest GAI can improve population health, suggesting significant health system savings. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This community-based exploratory study examined the effects of a history of violence, ethnic identification, and acculturation status on HIV risk among a majority Latino sample of youth living in a large metropolitan area of the Southwest in the United States. The participants reported high rates of violence and attitudes that put them at risk for HIV/AIDS infection. They participated in one of two prevention interventions offered by a local non-governmental organization. The first intervention was tailored for adjudicated youth (N = 49) who were either institutionalized or returning to the community after involvement with the criminal justice system. The second intervention targeted youth (N = 32) who were homeless/runaway and/or self-identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender (GLBT). T-tests and linear regression were used to determine the differences between youth reporting a history of violence by type of perpetrator, its relationship with HIV risk, and the role of ethnic identification and acculturation status as potential protective factors. Violence by a family member was the most common type of violence reported, with a history of violence positively related to HIV risk. Ethnic identification and linguistic acculturation had a protective effect against HIV risk among the homeless and GLBT youth but not among the adjudicated youth. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This article compares heterosexual and sexual minority street-involved youth across a number of sociodemographic, risk and current mental health, victimization and delinquency measures with a particular focus on gender differences. The sample consists of 147 homeless and street-involved young men and women aged 16-21 years in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Bivariate analyses indicate that many of the differences between the heterosexual and sexual minority youth are driven by differences among the young women. Multivariate analyses are then used to test for interactions between gender and sexual minority status alongside controls. The results suggest that gender, sexuality and street involvement intersect to shape outcomes in more complex ways than are acknowledged by the notion of accumulating or multiplying disadvantage common in the literature. The article concludes with a discussion focused on providing a more nuanced view of the experience of youth homelessness at the intersection of gender and sexuality. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk characteristics & sources of HIV information were examined during 1992-1994 interviews with 430 sexually active street youths recruited in Seattle, WA. The majority (80%) reported having multiple sex partners in the prior 30 days. Condom use was reported more frequently for nonmain vs main partners. Some 33+% had injected drugs, & almost all reported use of alcohol or other substances. Basic HIV knowledge & recent exposure to information were relatively high. The most frequently mentioned channels of information were small media (eg, brochures, flyers), followed by interpersonal & mass media sources; street-based small media were received by 63% of the sample & were the only specific source of HIV information to reach 50+% of the youths. Significant differences in sources of information were observed for gender & homeless status. Information exposure via small media channels was postively associated with several psychosocial variables pertaining to condom use with main sex partners, while exposure to any source was not related to variables associated with condom use with nonmain partners. Implications for prevention campaigns targeting street youth are discussed. 6 Tables, 29 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Background Lack of knowledge about sexual violence, its consequences, substance use and homelessness are major problems that make street dwellers susceptible to sexually transmitted diseases. Hence, this study assessed knowledge, attitudes and treatment-seeking behaviors related to sexually transmitted diseases among street dwellers in southern Ethiopia.Methods An explanatory sequential mixed-methods study design was conducted among 842 respondents. A simple random sampling technique was used to select seven cities among fourteen major cities of the region. The sample was allocated proportionally to each selected city. In order to identify and fill in the required sample size, a snowball sampling technique was used. A pre-tested and structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data. The collected data were entered using Epidata and exported to SPSS version 23.0 for further analysis. Unstructured questionnaires were also used to collect 21 in-depth interviews and 10 key informants’ interviews. Respondents for in-depth interviews were selected purposively during quantitative data collection.Results Most street dwellers were aware of (86.7%) and had a favourable attitude towards (84.4%) prevention and management of sexually transmitted diseases. A portion of respondents experienced bad-smelling genital discharge (13.8%), genital ulcers (11.2%) and a burning sensation (14.5%) during urination, in the previous year. Among those who experienced symptoms of sexually transmitted disease, only 15.3% of them received treatment from a health care provider. Fear of questions raised by providers was one of the reasons for not seeking care according to our qualitative findings.Conclusions In this study, a significant number of street dwellers reported experiencing symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease. Despite having awareness about sexually transmitted diseases, seeking treatment from a health center was found to be low based on both quantitative and qualitative findings. We recommend that health care providers should undergo special training to address the sexual and reproductive health problems of street dwellers.

AB  -  Parenting models are generally based on families in stable homes, rather than in transitional situations such as in foster care, homeless shelters, and other temporary, atrisk residences. Consequently, these models do not recognize the unique challenges of families in transition. This study explored the domains of the Circumplex Model and examined its fit for transitional families using tenets from community-based participatory research. Findings suggest that in addition to the Circumplex Model's components, caregivers with children living in transition believe that managing the scrutiny of external authority systems and countering the negative influences of poverty and racism are two indicators that contribute to parenting success. Obtaining consumer-informed views of parenting not only is an important contributor to standards of practice, but also a promising avenue for future research. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - As challenges to child well-being through economic disadvantage, family disruption, and migration or displacement escalate world wide, the need for cross-culturally robust understanding of childhood adversity proportionately increases. Toward this end, developmental risk was assessed in four contrasting groups of 107 Nepali children ages 10-14 years that represent distinctive, common conditions in which contemporary children grow up. Relative cumulative burden (allostatic load) indexed by multiple dimensions of physical and psychosocial stress was ascertained among homeless street boys and three family-based groups, from poor urban squatter settlements, urban middle class, and a remote rural village. Biomarkers of stress and vulnerability to stress included growth status, salivary cortisol, antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus, acute phase inflammatory responses (alpha1-antichymotrypsin), and cardiovascular fitness and reactivity (flex heart rate and pressor response). Individual biomarkers of risk and allostatic load differed markedly among groups, were highest in villagers, and varied by components of allostatic load. Such data suggest a need for critical appraisal of homelessness and migration as a risk factor to youth, given prevailing local conditions such as rural poverty, and represents the only multidimensional study of childhood allostatic load and developmental risk in non-Western settings.

AB  - Families experiencing homelessness struggle with food access and face a high burden of nutrition-related diseases. We assessed feasibility of Feastworthy, a prepared meal delivery program for families in motel-shelters with meals made from surplus food from local colleges. We used pre-and post-program surveys and semi-structured interviews, comparing participating families with families in a nearby shelter. During the three-month pilot, Feastworthy delivered 4,875 meals to 38 families; 33 families participated in the study (20 intervention and 13 control). Families reported that the motel-shelter worsened their diet and health, and reported increased food security and healthier diets with Feastworthy. In difference-in-differences analyses, vegetable intake trended upward by 0.6 servings/day (p=.08) among participants relative to comparison-site individuals. Changes in food security scores and out-of-pocket food expenses were no different. A delivered meal program was feasible and may provide health benefits for homeless families. Future larger-scale, longer-term studies will clarify its befits.

AB  - Evidence from American and Canadian studies over the last three decades demonstrates that youth exiting foster care are at a much higher risk to face a multiplicity of challenges than their peers who are not in care. These challenges result in negative outcomes, such as high rates of homelessness, under-education, unemployment or under-employment, poverty, mental health issues and post-traumatic stress, substance abuse and early pregnancy or parenthood. This systematic review addresses Independent Living Program (ILP) and Independent Living Services (ILS) studies in the U.S. and Canada published between 2000 and 2018. In order to compile a list of relevant ILP and ILS impact studies, a bibliographic search of six databases was conducted for the peer-reviewed literature, and the grey literature was searched using Google and expert consultation. The search yielded a total of 64 studies after applying our study selection protocol, with 50 from the peer review literature and 14 from the grey literature. The clear majority of studies originated from the U.S., with only three Canadian studies emerging from the grey literature. This is most likely due to differences in mandated data collection and reporting. In the U.S., data collection and reporting is mandatory under the Foster Care Independence Act in 1999. In Canada, there is no such mandatory reporting as child welfare services are under the sole jurisdiction of the provinces, with no Federal government involvement aside from First Nations children and youth. Studies to date suggest that ILP and ILS are not producing the intended outcomes, with limited to no impact demonstrated on youth leaving care wellbeing outcomes. In fact, some of the studies found a negative impact, especially related to social support. Much of the ILP and ILS studies did not incorporate the voices of youth in care, but rather focused on program process and components, staff experiences, and outcome measures such as social support, employment, income, housing and self-sufficiency. Of the limited ILP and ILS studies incorporating youth perspectives, youth in care often indicated that emotional support and mentoring are crucial needs during the transition to adulthood, which are often not the focus of ILP or ILS. Moreover, compared to the U.S., program impact studies in Canada are sorely lacking; more research needs to be done in this area to build our knowledge of evidence-based and best practices. This systematic review highlights two main conclusions: (1) Both the U.S. and Canada sorely need innovation with respect to preparing youth in care for the transition to adulthood; and (2) We also must commit to using rigorous research designs with such programming to determine the impact of such new approaches. In sum, we must reconceptualize our investment in youth in care and focus on their interdependence in order to realize their potential. This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

AB  - Stable housing is widely recognized as a prerequisite for the functioning of individuals and families. However, the housing stability of fathers is understudied, particularly for fathers living apart from their children. This analysis measures the extent and nature of fathers' housing insecurity using the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a national longitudinal survey of urban families. Housing insecurity affects a substantial portion of fathers, with 25% experiencing insecurity at least once in their child's first 9 years. However, few fathers report persistent insecurity that spans consecutive waves. Data also indicate significant differences in rates of housing insecurity between fathers living with, and apart from, the mothers of their children, with nonresident fathers far less likely to report secure housing and more likely to experience incarceration. The nature of insecurity experienced by nonresident fathers is also qualitatively different than that experienced by their coresident counterparts.

AB  - While there is a growing body of research on intimate partner violence (IPV) experienced by the housed youth population, a limited amount is known about IPV experienced by homeless youth. To our knowledge, no previous studies have examined how homeless youths' experience of IPV is related to their social network, even though the social networks of homeless youth have been shown to be significant indicators of health and mental health. The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship between IPV, gender, and social networks among a sample of 386 homeless youth in Los Angeles, California. Results revealed that one fifth of the sample experienced IPV in the past year. Stratified regression models revealed that IPV was not significantly related to any measure of male social networks; however, females who experienced IPV had more male friends (Beta = 2.03, SE = 0.89, p < .05) than females who did not experience IPV. Female homeless youth who witnessed family violence during childhood had more male friends (Beta = 2.75, SE = 1.08, p < .05), but those who experienced sexual abuse during childhood had fewer male friends (Beta = -2.04, SE = 0.93, p < .05). Although there was no significant difference in the rate of IPV victimization across genders, the context of this abuse appears to be drastically different. The results suggest that females with more male friendships are at greater risk for exposure to IPV. To date, there are few effective youth-targeted IPV prevention programs and none have been shown to be effective with homeless youth. These results provide insight into future program development.

AB  - Parents & their adolescent children from 199 poor families in Hong Kong responded to the Chinese Perceived Causes of Poverty Scale (that assesses beliefs about causes of poverty in terms of personal problems, exploitation, lack of opportunities, fate, & external causes) & measures of psychological well-being over two consecutive years. Results showed that measures of beliefs about causes of poverty (particularly beliefs in terms of fate & external factors over which one has little control) were concurrently & longitudinally related to psychological well-being. Prospective analyses further showed that the relations between these two domains were bi-directional in nature. Parent-adolescent differences (parents vs adolescents) & parental differences (fathers vs mothers) in the linkages between beliefs about causes of poverty & psychological well-being were found. The present findings suggest that family therapists & allied helping professionals should be sensitive to the role played by beliefs about causes of poverty held by family members when they work with families experiencing economic disadvantage. 3 Tables, 38 References.

AB  - Homeless youth are a vulnerable and understudied group who has consistently reported elevated levels of substance use. Understanding the factors associated with substance use within this population may help guide future intervention efforts. Although few studies have examined the role of abstinence self-efficacy and coping in substance use among homeless youth, some research indicates that higher abstinence self-efficacy and greater use of task-oriented coping are related to lower substance use, while greater use of emotion-oriented and avoidance-oriented coping are related to higher substance use. Accordingly, the current study examined the relationship between abstinence self-efficacy, coping, and substance use among homeless youth, while controlling for the effects of age, gender, and ethnicity. A sample of 40 homeless youth (ages 17 to 24) was recruited from the only drop-in center in a Midwestern city. Data were obtained at one point in time, and included information regarding abstinence self-efficacy, coping, and frequency of alcohol and drug use. A series of hierarchical regression analyses were conducted. In order to control for the effects of age, gender, and ethnicity, these variables were entered in the first step, and abstinence self-efficacy and coping were included in the second step of analysis. A significant relationship was found between abstinence self-efficacy and alcohol and drug use. Specifically, higher abstinence self-efficacy was related to lower alcohol and drug use. Additionally, an interaction between abstinence self-efficacy and substance use was found in which African American, compared to non-African-American youth, reported reduced alcohol use as their level of abstinence self-efficacy in social pressure to use increased. However, coping was not associated with substance use. The current study provides empirical support for the relationship between abstinence self-efficacy and substance use among homeless youth. The findings have practical implications. Although a longitudinal design and an intervention trial is needed to confirm, increasing abstinence self-efficacy through intervention efforts may be an effective strategy for reducing substance use among these youth.

AB  - Public programs like domestic violence shelters and family shelters are developed for a specific purpose, domestic violence and homelessness respectively. Analysis comparing two separate samples (n = 147 and n = 291) of single-female-headed families using either type of shelter found many more similarities than differences between the populations. Among the similarities are the rates of mental health and substance abuse problems, lifetime rates of victimization and trauma, and issues related to poverty, including difficulty paying bills and rent. These similarities suggest families at both types of shelters may have similar service needs, and families at homeless family shelters would benefit from the wider range of services provided to domestic violence clients, including attention to trauma and violence issues.

AB  - In a 3-month experiment conducted in the municipality of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, educators worked in a middle-class park with extensive greenspace with residents (age 2-15) of slum areas in an attempt to understand the relationship between environment, culture, & developmental growth. Participants did not have access to safe, clean, or uncrowded play spaces & generally came from deprived backgrounds. During the experiment, several stages of behavior were expressed. During the first 2 months, participants were aggressive, refusing to participate in organized activities. After making administrative & structural changes, the children were less aggressive & confrontational, & more involved in games & activities with toys. Though the experiment has ended, many participants still use the park & are participating in the informal & ongoing process of personal education & development. J. MacDowell

AB  - Reviews the literature to ascertain the probability that adolescents who experiment with risky behaviors -- eg, gang activity, drug & alcohol abuse, criminal activities, truancy, & early sex -- will not develop into productive & successful adults. A model for identifying risk antecedents & marks is proposed, including family dysfunction, poverty, quality of neighborhood, school performance & grade retention, out-of-home placement/foster care, problem behavior, early sexual behavior, homelessness, running away, substance abuse, & criminal behavior. The outcomes that are injurious to the youth's development into productive adults include: sexually transmitted diseases; adolescent morbidity & mortality due to accidents, homicide, & suicide; & chronic problem behavior. Current barriers that impede programs aimed at prevention are federal funding structures & eligibility guidelines. Three programs are outlined in TN, CO, & TX, states that emphasize comprehensive service-integration strategies. 66 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This pilot study explores issues of culture & alcohol & other drug use in relation to substance abuse prevention with high-risk youth, with a particular interest in Latinos/as & acculturation. Many of the prominent prevention studies are school based, missing some of the youth at very highest risk for alcohol & drug use & abuse. Consequently, this study was conducted in community settings with youth from high-risk neighborhoods & environmental conditions including a homeless youth shelter, an alternative learning setting, & a low income community program. The data indicated a high lifetime prevalence of drug use (over 80% for Whites & Latinos for beer, wine, liquor, & marijuana), with consistently lower prevalence rates observed among African-Americans. In addition, the study found significant ethnic differences in substance use (last 30 days) in the sample (median age = 16), with African-Americans reporting significantly lower incidence of marijuana & cocaine use (p < .05) than other youth. Implications for prevention, intervention & future research are discussed. References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - BackgroundIllicit drug use in adolescence has been linked to drug use and poor mental health in adult life, but few studies have examined the relation between adult economic and criminal justice outcomes.MethodsWe analysed data from 14 082 participants (6999 women) in the 1970 British Birth Cohort Study. Illicit drug use over study members’ lifetime and in the past year were self-reported at 16 years of age. Thirteen outcomes were self-reported at 30 years of age, including illicit drug use, smoking, problems with alcohol, mental and physical health, experience of socioeconomic disadvantage and experiences with the criminal justice system.ResultsAt 16 years of age, 20.3% of the participants had ever tried an illicit drug and 7.2% had used in the past year. After adjustment for ﻿childhood socioeconomic status and mental health problems, and following correction for multiple testing, there was a dose–response association between illicit drug use at 16 years with illicit drug use in adult life in the past year (OR; 95% CI – 1.83, 1.51 to 3.12), experiencing homelessness (1.74, 1.16 to 2.62), being arrested (1.57, 1.29 to 1.92) and cautioned (1.97, 1.50 to 2.57) by the police, and being found guilty at court (1.73, 1.34 to 2.23).ConclusionsAdolescent drug use was associated with an array of social and criminal outcomes in later life.

AB  - The relationship between perceived level of maternal support & adolescent well-being as measured by level of self-esteem was examined in a sample of 103 black child participants living in urban formal housing & urban informal housing. The study findings support previous research demonstrating a relationship between maternal support & adolescent psychological well-being. The findings also point to the benefits of an authoritative style of maternal support that is context-specific. Authoritative or strict maternal parenting in this study, operationalized in terms of an achievement-oriented maternal support, was significantly related to mental well-being of children living in informal settlements. Affiliative-related maternal support & lack of social isolation were related to increased adolescent well-being in urban formal housing. Gender differences in perceived maternal support were also evident in the sample. Mother's presence at home was also related to increased psychological well-being as measured by self-esteem. 3 Tables, 42 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) is a federal cash welfare program for low-income, working families with children in the United States that requires participation with child support enforcement, if one parent is noncustodial, to receive the cash benefit. cash assistance has been linked to improved child health and academic achievement, but sanctions to benefits can increase health risks. Our community-engaged, mixed-methods research project sought to identify barriers to TANF among families with young children in Illinois. In this study we analyzed TANF sanctions related to child support enforcement, using analysis of TANF administrative data and semistructured interviews with TANF customers. We conducted logistic regression and Fisher's test to explore demographic differences in sanctioning and sanction types. Black families were 111 percent more likely than White families to receive at least one sanction in 2018-19. Black families who were enrolled in TANF received more sanctions for child support noncompliance (2018: 42 percent; 2019: 50 percent) than White families (2018: 30 percent; 2019: 34 percent). Mothers who were survivors of intimate partner violence voiced particular challenges with child support compliance. Policy recommendations include shifting to alternative cash assistance models and removing pass-through funding so that families receive the full child support benefit.

AB  - This paper investigates children's experiences of hyperdiversity in public spaces in inner city and suburban neighbourhoods in Auckland, New Zealand. As children walk through, and talk about, their everyday places of play and mobility they sense and reveal material and relational diversity in the places and people they encounter. We examine temporal and affective changes in children's experiences of familiar places when in the presence of strangers - older youth and homeless people. We draw on walking interview and/or focus group data gathered from children aged 9-12 years living in socio economically and ethnically diverse neighbourhoods. Declining rates of physical activity and independent mobility in children and calls for urban spaces that nurture children's agency and wellbeing provide the research context. Ideas of enabling places are adapted to explore the way constructs of otherness, inclusion and difference can be fortified through social and material expressions of hyperdiversity in the urban landscape. We explore the contention that how children and adults behave, identify and feel within particular urban spaces arises from everyday encounters and affective relations with place itself. In so doing, we seek a conceptual broadening of place as an enabler of children's mobility, agency and wellbeing.

AB  - This study uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and highlights the extent of poverty and working poverty between 1986 and 2004 (N= 5,164). Over one third (34.2%) of the study sample lived in a poor family at least one year, and nearly one fourth (24.2%) lived in a working poor family at least one year. In addition, almost three fourths (70.1%) of those who lived in a poor family at least one year also lived at least one year in a working poor family. Differences were found by gender and race/ethnicity. Findings suggest that poverty as a social problem is better formulated in terms of working rather than nonworking poverty and that gender and race/ethnicity disparities are prevalent. Policy options, such as expansion of the earned income tax credit and implementation of a basic income guarantee, are explored. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - BackgroundChildhood abuse and homelessness are independently associated with substance use. Though childhood abuse and homelessness are strongly correlated, research on the joint effect of exposure to both traumatic life events on substance use is limited. Objective: To estimate independent and joint effects of childhood abuse and homelessness on substance use risk during emerging adulthood and adulthood. Methods: Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 12,288), we measured associations between exposure to physical or sexual abuse in childhood, homelessness in childhood or emerging adulthood, or exposure to both traumas and outcomes of binge drinking, marijuana use, cocaine use, methamphetamine use, and prescription opioid misuse during emerging adulthood (Wave III, ages 18–26 years) and adulthood (Wave IV, ages 24–32 years). Results: In adjusted analyses, exposure to childhood abuse alone, homelessness alone, and both childhood abuse and homelessness were significant correlates of most substance use indicators in emerging adulthood. Those jointly exposed to childhood abuse and homelessness had disproportionate risk of substance use, particularly use of cocaine (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=4.25, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.70, 6.71) and methamphetamine (AOR = 6.59, 95% CI: 3.87, 11.21). The independent and combined effects of abuse and homelessness generally persisted into adulthood though associations tended to weaken. Conclusions/Importance: Those with exposure to abuse, homelessness, and both adverse outcomes constitute a high-risk population for substance use. Addressing abuse and homelessness should be a component of preventing drug risk for screening, treatment, and prevention efforts.

AB  - ObjectivesTo systematically review interventions that include an element of menstrual education delivered to young adolescent girls.DesignThis was a systematic review and meta-analysis. Selected articles were quality assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool quality appraisal checklist. A meta-analysis was conducted on a subset of articles, and the effect size of the intervention was calculated using Cohen’s d. A logic model was constructed to frame the effect of menstrual education interventions on menstrual health.SettingPapers reporting on interventions in high-income and low-income and middle-income countries were sought.Information sourcesSeven electronic databases were searched for English-language entries that were published between January 2014 and May 2020.ParticipantsThe interventions were aimed at younger adolescent girls aged 10–14 years old.InterventionsThe interventions were designed to improve the menstrual health of the recipients, by addressing one or more elements of menstrual knowledge, attitude or practices (KAP).Eligibility criteriaInterventions that had not been evaluated were excluded.Primary and secondary outcomesThe most common type of output was a difference in knowledge or skill score ascertained from a pre and post test. Some studies measured additional outcomes, such as attitude or confidence.ResultsTwenty-four eligible studies were identified. The number of participants varied from 1 to 2564. All studies reported improvements in menstrual KAP. The meta-analysis indicates that larger effect sizes were attained by those that encouraged discussion than those that distributed pamphlets.ConclusionsEducation interventions are effective in increasing the menstrual knowledge of young adolescent girls and skills training improves competency to manage menstruation more hygienically and comfortably. Interactive interventions are more motivating than didactic or written. Sharing concerns gives girls confidence and helps them to gain agency on the path to menstrual health.Trial registration numberFor this review, a protocol was not prepared or registered.

AB  - Background Children living in challenged humanitarian settings (including those in rural/underserved areas, the displaced, refugees, in conflict/post conflict situations) are at greater risk of mental health difficulties or behavioural problems, with caregivers acting as their main protective factors. While many family skills programmes exist, very few were developed for, or piloted in, low resource settings (settings with limited infrastructure, typical of humanitarian settings). We therefore designed a brief and light programme; the Strong Families (SF) programme, consisting of 5 h contact time over 3 weeks. We conducted a pilot study with the aim to test the feasibility of implementation, and a preliminary look at the effectiveness of SF, in improving child behaviour and family functioning in families living in Afghanistan.Methods We recruited female caregivers and children aged 8–12 years through schools and drug treatment centres in Afghanistan and enrolled them in the SF programme. Demographic data, emotional and behavioural difficulties of children and parental skills and family adjustment measures were collected from caregivers before, 2 and 6 weeks after the intervention. Outcome was assessed through the SDQ (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), assessing children’s behavioural, emotional, and social issues, and PAFAS (Parenting and Family Adjustment Scales), measuring parenting practices and family functioning.Results We enrolled 72 families in the programme with a 93.1% retention rate (n = 67) for data collection 6 weeks post intervention. Mean age of caregivers was 36.1 years, they had 3.8 children on average and 91.7% of them had experienced war/armed conflict in their past. The average total difficulty score of the SDQ (ranging from 0 to 40, with scores above 16 being indicative of high problems) of the 72 children reduced significantly, from 17.8 at pre-test to 12.9 at post-test and 10.6 at second follow-up, with no difference in gender and most noticeably amongst those with the highest scores at baseline. Likewise, PAFAS scores decreased significantly after the programme, again with caregivers with the highest scores at baseline improving most.Conclusions The implementation of a brief family skills programme was seemingly effective and feasible in a resource-limited setting and positively improved child mental health and parenting practices and family adjustment skills. These results suggest the value of such a programme and call for further validation through other methods of impact assessment and outcome evaluation.Trial registration ISRCTN76509384.

AB  - Youths who experience homelessness are at high risk of victimization, yet little is known about school violence in the context of students experiencing homelessness. Specifically, limited research has considered different subgroups of students experiencing homelessness according to the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act (nonsheltered, sheltered, doubled up) in comparison with nonhomeless students. Using a representative sample ofCalifornia public high school students (N = 390,028), authors applied bivariate and multivariate analyses to examine differences among nonsheltered, sheltered, and doubled-up students experiencing homelessness regarding levels of discriminatory bullying, behavioral victimization, and weapon victimization at school. Findings show that students experiencing homelessness across all subgroups are at high risk of experiencing school violence. The severity of findings and differences among subgroups emphasize the need to develop school-based responses for each subgroup. Providers serving youths experiencing homelessness are encouraged to consider schools as a site for prevention and intervention for this population.

AB  - The article describes a study carried out with a representative sample of homeless people in Madrid (Spain; N = 188). This study aims to corroborate the relationship identified in the literature between stressful life events and suicidal behaviour in a group in a situation of social exclusion, to assess the differences in the number and characteristics of stressful life events experienced by homeless people who are attempters and non‐attempters, and to identify which combination of stressful life events enables discrimination for suicide attempts among homeless people. The results show that 30% of homeless people in Madrid had attempted suicide, and 57.9% of them had done so for the first time when they were homeless. The interviewees are shown to have experienced a large amount of stressful life events, with substantially more stressors experienced by the homeless people who tried to commit suicide, during both their childhood and adolescence and throughout their life. Finally, we found that the combination of 7 stressful life events provided the best possible discrimination between homeless attempters and non‐attempters.

AB  - Background Supportive housing is a promising intervention for insecurely housed families in the child welfare system. Objectives We examined factors associated with housing and child welfare outcomes to understand whom supportive housing benefits the most. Participants and setting Analyses included 500 insecurely housed families involved in child protective services across five U.S. sites. Researchers randomized families to receive supportive housing or the usual services offered to families in local child welfare systems. Methods We examined predictors of homelessness and child welfare outcomes with logistic regression, survival analysis, and receiver operating characteristic curves. We also examined supportive housing's effect across risk levels for each outcome and tested theoretical moderators of intervention effects. Results Consistent with findings from the larger project of which this was a part, supportive housing improved housing outcomes for families, especially those most at risk form homelessness. Its effects on child welfare outcomes varied by study site more than by risk level. Family characteristics and experiences that predicted housing and child welfare outcomes also varied by site and added limited accuracy to predictive models. Theoretical moderators did not influence supportive housing's effects. Conclusions Supportive housing increases housing security and may influence child welfare outcomes in some contexts. Family characteristics and experiences marginally improve targeting of supportive housing to insecurely housed families involved with CPS.

AB  - Cognitive distortions are conceptualized as one of the most potent predictors of suicide. However, little is known about the mediating and moderating mechanisms linking cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation. The present study examined a prospective moderated mediation model linking cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation, with drug use, social problem-solving, and perceived burdensomeness as the mediators and childhood sexual abuse as the moderator. Participants included 150 homeless youth who participated in a randomized clinical trial for suicide intervention. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. We analyzed the data using a multiple-group path model. Findings showed that social problem-solving and perceived burdensomeness sequentially mediated the association between cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation regardless of childhood sexual abuse, whereas drug use mediated the association between cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation only among youth reporting no history of sexual abuse. Findings highlight how coping processes, both adaptive and maladaptive, operate differently to predict suicidal ideation contingent on the effects of childhood sexual abuse in the context of cognitive distortions. Findings also underscore the importance of addressing the effects of childhood abuse to facilitate the efficiency of interventions that seek to reduce suicidal ideation among a vulnerable population.

AB  - Levels of adherence to HIV treatment are lower among adolescents compared with older and younger individuals receiving similar therapies. We purposely sampled the most and least adherent adolescents from a 300-adolescent longitudinal HIV treatment adherence study in Gaborone, Botswana. Multiple objective and subjective measures of adherence were available and study participants were selected based on sustained patterns of either excellent or poor adherence over a one-year period. Focus group discussions (FGD) and in-depth interviews (IDI) were conducted with the adolescents and a subset of their caregivers with the goal of revealing barriers and facilitators of adherence. Focus groups were segregated by adherence classification of the participants. Following coding of transcripts, matrices were developed based on participants' adherence classifications in order to clarify differences in themes generated by individuals with different adherence characteristics. 47 adolescents and 25 adults were included. The non-adherent adolescents were older than the adherent adolescents (median age 18 years (IQR 16-19) vs. 14 years (IQR 12-15 years)), with median time on treatment near 10 years in both groups. Interference with daily activities, concerns about stigma and discrimination, side effects, denial of HIV status, and food insecurity arose as challenges to adherence among both those who were consistently adherent and those who were poorly-adherent to their medications. Low outcome expectancy, treatment fatigue, mental health and substance use problems, and mismatches between desired and received social support were discussed only among poorly adherent adolescents and their caregivers. Challenges raised only among adolescents and caregivers in the non-adherent groups are hypothesis-generating, identifying areas that may have a greater contribution to poor outcomes than challenges faced by both adherent and non-adherent adolescents. The contribution of these factors to poor outcomes should be explored in future studies.

AB  -  This article explores street children's exposure to and responses to violence based on data collected in 21 major towns in Uganda. Findings show that violence among Ugandan street children is endemic, perpetuated by both street children against each other and adults. Both male and female children suffer outright abuse from police, occasional strangers, and from each other. Boys were more frequently physically abused while girls were more frequently abused emotionally and sexually. The study recommends policy-oriented actions linked to addressing the variations in the vulnerability to violence among children on the basis of gender, age and other risk factors and targeting the change of attitudes and behavior among duty bearers in various settings, which result in violence against children on the street.

AB  - In an essay in Critical Social Work, Robert Fairbanks suggests that space perspectives need to be accounted for in social work practice if the profession is to procure a more nuanced understanding of the production of social relationships. Yet, Fairbanks's analysis fails to account for the problematic of a spatialised politics of belonging for racialised subjects, and for the connections between racialising practices and (neo)liberal governance on localized social-spatial relations. This paper addresses these shortcoming by accomplishing three objectives: (1) To introduce a renewed vector of space thesis by borrowing from post-colonial writings; (2) To enliven that frame by critically reading visual images produced within the context of social service agencies in Toronto. I examine how these images attempt to reorient codes of difference and belonging in relationship to the representational and material contexts in which they were produced; and (3) To provoke a Social Work response to its own animation of these theoretical precepts. I argue that client produced representations reposition a practice sight-line away from a positioning of client subjectivity as redeemable only in its neo-liberal guise or as surplus in its democratic value, towards one that allows for an inter-subjective unfolding of identity, place and belonging.

AB  - The impact of low-wage employment of mothers who previously received welfare on the development of their children, ages 5-14, is examined through analysis of National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data on 1,154 children whose mothers were single & received Aid to Families with Dependent Children at some point, 1986-1990. Maternal employment in general was associated with lower levels of behavioral problems among girls, & employment at wage levels of $7.50 was associated with lower levels of behavior problems for all children. Girls of mothers who worked had higher math scores compared to girls of nonworking mothers, but no difference in math scores for boys with working vs nonworking mothers were found. 2 Tables.

AB  - In 2007 Jayne Mooney observed that violence against women was a public anathema and a private commonplace all at the same time. In the decade since this observation was made it would not be hard to conclude that the situation remains the same despite the increasing public policy profile afforded to such violence(s). The purpose of this paper is to consider how and why such forceful observations can still be made and it will do so by reflecting on five inter-connected ongoing tensions for the community safety agenda in addressing violence against women. These tensions are: epistemic (who can know what); methodological (how things, like violence against women, can be known); conceptual (how to make sense of what we think we know); saliency (what variables count and when); policy (what can be done in the light of the foregoing issues); and global (the Northern bias ners, lovers, colleagues, co-workers. In these relationships women learn to deal with  harassment, incest, violence, and rape over the course of their lives. These learning  experiences are not easily separable into a public and private domain. For example,  the routine fears experienced by young mothers in Palestine, the associated surveil-  lance of their bodies, and their resistance to such oppression reported by Shalhoub-  Kevorkian (2015), stand in stark contrast to the blinkered vision of how and when  fear is experienced as articulated in criminal victimisation survey data. Thus the  feminist path offers an appreciation of women’s lives as differently and differentially  informed by the everydayness of ordinary fears. Importantly for community safety  agendas this demands acknowledging that women are just as likely to fear men that  they know and with whom they live and/or are close to as they are strangers. This is  telling advice for all those crime prevention and community safety initiatives want-  ing to spend money on improved street lighting, or better lit car parks, comforting as  such initiatives might be. Importantly notions of who we might be afraid of are also  tied to who might be thought of as risky. So implicit to the myriad of work focusing  on the fear of crime is also the concept of risk.  O’Malley (2006: 49) has pointed out, ‘crime prevention has succeeded in marry-  ing risk with a more traditional social and behavioural form of criminology by trans-  lating the old causes of crime into risk factors’. This pre-occupation with risk factors  is evident from the local to the global illustrated by the adoption of the World Health  Organisation’s ‘ecological model’ of violence into national violence prevention  289Reflections on community safety: the ongoing precarity of…  programmes. This model assumes that violence can be prevented by reducing the  violent characteristics of individuals. However it also begs the questions; what does  violence mean and who does what to whom? (Hester 2013). Indeed a further ques-  tion might be: How is it possible to understand the risk factors of violent behaviour  when arguably violence and the recourse to violence exist in the folds of everyday  life (to borrow a phrase from Das 2007). The problematic nature of these issues is  particularly well demonstrated by Shalhoub-Kevorkian (2003: 603), who, in dis-  cussing femicide, asks;  What is the alternative if her male adult ‘protector’ abuses her (sexually, emo-  tionally, physically), and how can she speak about her abuse if she has never  learned that it is possible to voice personal matters? How can she speak out  when she knows that customs and cultural codes may be used to cause her  death? How can she ask for help when her protectors might also be her ene-  mies? …..What happens if the legal system supports her femicide?  Under these kinds of conditions what counts as risk and who counts as risky are  arguably quite differently informed than any identification of risk factors might lead  us to believe. It is a view which also carries with it huge implications for under-  standings of what counts as community and community safety when seen through  such a differently informed gendered and ethnicised lens (see also the work of Gill  and Harrison 2016). Nevertheless the identification of risk factors has been a signifi-  cant driver of policy interventions in the crime prevention field in relation to vio-  lence against women and some of these risk factors have been derived from criminal  victimisation survey data.  The ‘discovery’ of the repeated nature of criminal victimisation from criminal  victimisation survey data, especially in relation to intimate partner violence, had  an important effect on informing policy responses, especially policing responses to  such violence. For example, initial responses in the UK ‘flagged’ such victims on  police computer systems so that they could be dealt with appropriately. However,  as Pease suggests in this issue, responding to the phenomenon of repeat victimisa-  tion was quickly left behind. This happened as the risk assessment tools used in the  context of multi-agency responses to violence against women became increasingly  accepted as the preferred community-based response to such violence. Contem-  porarily there is a wide range of risk assessment tools available, from the Spousal  Risk Assessment Guide (SARA), the Propensity for Abusiveness Scale (PAS); to the  Partner Abuse Prognostic Scale (PAPS) (all quoted in Hoyle 2008: 327). The DASH  model is favoured by most police forces in the UK (Domestic Abuse, Stalking and  Harassment, and Honour Based Violence). McCulloch et al. (2016) review a further  nine tools (including DASH) designed to inform responses to intimate partner vio-  lence and used to assess the levels of risk judged to be present in individual cases.  Some risk assessment practices endeavour to pay greater attention to the victim’s  voice in the assessment process, and as Hoyle (2008: 332) observes, these typically  include getting the victim to agree to ‘safety plans’ for which ‘victims are made indi-  vidually accountable—in part, at least—for minimising the risk of further violence’.  Simultaneously such plans fail to ‘take into consideration women’s own assessments  of the danger they are in, independent of other risk factors, even though most studies  290 S. Walklate  suggest it is highly predictive of serious domestic assault’ (ibid. 330; see also Camp-  bell 2004; Heckert and Gondolf 2004).  These observations reveal the tensions referred to above in relation to who can  know what and who is listened to as a consequence. Indeed there are multiple exam-  ples of cases in which the failure to listen to women’s own voices appropriately  resulted in their subsequent death and/or serious injury. The fact remains that the  number of women murdered by their partners or ex-partners has remained unremit-  tingly consistent over the last 20 years in England and Wales as well as elsewhere.  From the Thurman Case in the USA in the early 1980s that led to the introduction of  mandatory arrest policies in cases of domestic violence, to the case of Kelly Thomp-  son in Melbourne, Australia, in 2015 who was killed by her partner after 38 calls to  police over a 3-week period for breaches of intervention orders, little has changed  in the capacity for policy responses to prevent these kinds of fatal outcomes. The  multi-agency community-based activities of MARAC’s (multi-agency risk assess-  ment conferences) and the presence of IDVA’s (independent domestic violence advi-  sors: in 2018 there were 815 such advisors in England and Wales) have made little  impact on such fatal outcomes either. Of course, since 2008 much of the work in  relation to policing in general and responses to violence against women has been  subjected to the effects of the wider cuts in policing budgets as a result of austerity  measures. Nevertheless, as Walklate (2018) has argued, the difficulties in engaging  in meaningful risk assessment practices for at-risk victims in this arena amount to  conceptual failure (Lewis and Greene 1978). Indeed the faulty theoretical founda-  tions of risk on which these practices are actually built are now well established  (Mythen 2014). Moreover, McCulloch et al. (2016: 58) state ‘there is a paucity of  empirical research evaluating the outcomes of [international] risk assessments…’,  with Westmarland (2011:300–301) observing that the relationship between such risk  assessment exercises and subsequent incidents of femicide is somewhat arbitrary.  Taken together these problems comprise an inability to think about security through  a gendered lens.  Since the events of 11 September 2001 and like events since, it is possible to  argue that the framing of community safety has become increasingly informed  by questions of security. The UK Government’s PREVENT agenda has become a  central feature of these concerns in which the question of the relationship between  community, crime, and crime prevention has become increasingly informed by the  potential or otherwise for radicalisation. Put specifically the concern with the pre-  vention of violent extremism is one in which the security of the state has taken prec-  edence over security as a local and/or individual sense of well-being (see amongst  others Walklate et al. 2017). This pre-occupation has had a number of telling effects  one of which is the extent to which the continuities between violence against women  and violent extremism, particularly ‘lone’ terrorist attacks (see Hamm and Spaij  2017), have taken a back seat in the rush to target communities presumed to be a  risk to national security. Lack of space dictates an inability to unwrap all of the  issues that the question of security raises for community safety, but the failure to  envision communities as structured spaces in which some voices are heard and oth-  ers not is an important one. Contemporarily policy agendas outside of community  control can frame what safety might look like and for whom within communities.  291Reflections on community safety: the ongoing precarity of…  This means that those who are not heard remain locked into very informal networks  of support and control: some of which can work well, some of which do not. Honour  killings and forced marriage are perhaps two of the more contentious and contested  issues which serve to illustrate the bigger problem of the failure to think through  the consequences of such policies for those who remain invisible in them. For the  purposes of the discussion here, this means taking account of gender. This leads  into the more recent focus on the question of vulnerability in informing responses to  community safety.  The concept of vulnerability has rarely been explored in its own right (Green  2007), and a good deal of policy takes what might be called inherent vulnerabil-  ity (that characterised by age, mental capacity, or physical ability) as the grounds  for special treatment. For Sparks (1982) vulnerability is not physical but rather is  informed by who is considered to be at risk and who is considered to be harmed by  such risk. This is a view embraced by criminal victimisation surveys in which the  data gathered measure vulnerability by measuring who is at most risk from crime  and then linking those data with other information about who crime has the most  impact on. The relationship between these two variables determines who is the most  vulnerable. However the most vulnerable are not always those positively targeted by  policy particularly at the community level. The hierarchy of victimisation identified  by Carrabine et al. (2004) illustrates this. At the bottom of this hierarchy would be  the homeless, the drug addict, the street prostitute: all those for whom their lifestyle  renders them prone to victimisation (vulnerable but denied victim status), and nearer  the top would be the elderly female victim of violent crime (the least prone to such  crime, but assumed to be vulnerable and readily assigned victim status). Contem-  porarily the concept of vulnerability has increasingly informed policy and practice,  explicitly in terms of who policy is directed towards (for example communities vul-  nerable to the risk of radicalisation) and implicitly in terms of resource allocation  (for example the assumed progression from low, medium to high risk in cases of  intimate partner violence when there is little evidence that such progression exists,  see Johnson et al. 2017). Taken together, these issues point to the importance of the  relationship between policy and saliency.  Saliency, policy, and the global  Recently Kruttschnidt (2016) has reiterated the point that as yet still not enough  is known about when gender is the salient variable. Social lives are complicated  and it would be naïve to assume that any particular course of action, including  being a victim or a perpetrator of violence against women, was not equally com-  plex. However under some circumstances it is known that gender does matter.  The statistical evidence is for the most part irrefutable: it is predominantly men  who are violent towards women, and it is also the case that some women are  violent towards some men. How these data are read informs how such violence  is responded to. The intervention by Welch (2008) referenced above focused  detailed attention on how understandings of who the perpetrators are and who the  victims are in community-based responses to domestic violence and illustrates  292 S. Walklate  the importance of this issue. Thus the question of saliency and the extent to  which gender is considered the salient variable is deeply entrenched in the kind of  policy response which flows from the data.  Contemporarily, in comparison with 1998, there has been a shift towards the term  gender which is now commonly used by policy makers and practitioners (and indeed  some academics) as a substitute for sex. This shift assumes that this deals with the  contested nature of the relationship between sex and gender and in so doing erases  the questions that a serious embrace of gender can pose. For example, it remains the  case that male-dominated criminal justice systems (which most still are) can and do  have an important impact on responding to gendered crimes like domestic violence  and rape (for both men and women as victims of these crimes). Similarly under-  standing communities as gendered communities in policy terms still has some way  to travel in appreciating that the lived reality of communities looks different for men,  women, and other groups who occupy different structural positions within a com-  munity. Referring back to Genn’s (1988) profound observation of violence as ‘just  part of life’ aptly captures this policy dilemma. Recognising this dilemma requires  more than simply substituting the term gender for sex. An appreciation of structural  location serves also to remind us that in this arena, like many others, criminal justice  policies travel, not just from one locality to another but also globally and the direc-  tion of that travel is more often than not from the global north to the global south.  This paper has referred to this phenomenon in relation to violence against women  using Goodmark’s (2015) label of ‘exporting without a licence’. This conveys much  that is contentious in the policy transfer process. On the one hand exportation might  serve to problematise behaviour previously considered unproblematic. For example,  campaign groups in some European countries have used the Istanbul Convention  (which became effective in 2014) to assert pressure on their governments to take  violence against women seriously. On the other hand those same processes can also  erase and silence the issues of location, specificity, and cultural difference. Fitz-Gib-  bon and Walklate (2017) have subjected Clare’s law (the Domestic Violence Dis-  closure Scheme introduced in England and Wales in 2014) and the pro-arrest stance  towards domestic violence as illustrative of both of this. Cunneen and Rowe (2015:  15) point the finger at the epistemic violence done by the beliefs in the superior-  ity of, what they call, Eurocentric thinking. This, they observe, has crucial conse-  quences insofar as  … Eurocentric domestic violence, law and policy imposed in Indigenous con-  texts is often predicated on an incongruent ontological and epistemological  reality – a reality based on the potential for autonomous and individualised  decision making  Assuming a potential for ‘autonomous and individualised decision making’, whether  that be for a woman living with coercive control in England and Wales, or for a  member of an Indigenous community already labelled as risky in Australia, runs  through the tensions discussed in this paper. All of which when taken together act  as barriers to effective policy responses to crime prevention and community safety.  Such barriers can assume a uniform and unified subject and object of intervention  the dangers of which are reflected in the conceptual failure discussed above.  293Reflections on community safety: the ongoing precarity of…  Conclusion: The ongoing precarity of women’s lives  Loader and Walker (2001) observed that our sense of security is deeply embed-  ded in our relationships with others. For women living with violence this involves  a precarious existence between keeping themselves and their children safe in  ways that might demand they stay with the person who threatens them most. The  policy activity documented above represents a plethora of initiatives few of which  have impacted upon this fundamental ‘truth’. The failure to commit to the kind  of whole systems approach advocated by Wilson in 1983will continue to embed  women’s lives in a precariousness which is often compounded by the policies  intended to support and help them. Perhaps the time is ripe for a Royal Commis-  sion on Violence Against Women which could take a long hard look at what has  and has not worked over the last 20 years. Such a commission would need to take  to heart that for some (women) violence is ‘just part of life’ before any in-roads  could be made to render community safety an inclusive experience. So much  remains to be done both in how community safety is understood, the evidence  based on which such understandings are constructed, and the extent to which  gendered thinking informs both of these issues. Some in-roads have already been  made on these questions (see for example the measurement work reported by  Walby et al. 2016). There is more to do.

AB  - Objective: We characterized lifetime drinking trajectories among persons living with HIV (PLWH) and examined how trajectories are related to health. Method: Adults (ages 20–71) were recruited between 2015 and 2017 for a cohort study examining the impact of alcohol use on geriatric comorbidities in PLWH in New Orleans. The New Orleans Alcohol Use in HIV (NOAH) Study (n = 356; 68.8% male) included in-person interviews, anthropometric measurements, and biospecimen collection. Average monthly drinks per decade of life was derived from participants' reported average quantity and frequency of alcoholic beverages for each decade. Health indicators included CD4 count, viral load, health-related quality of life, frailty, comorbidities, body mass index, heavy drinking, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Participants also reported lifetime experiences with homelessness and incarceration. Latent curve modeling was applied in MPlus to derive lifetime drinking trajectories. Latent trajectory parameters were modeled as predictors of physical, mental, and social health, controlling for demographics. Results: Alcohol consumption increased significantly between the teen years and midlife (31–40), declining thereafter through ages 50–60. Significant interindividual differences were observed in all trajectory parameters. Persons with higher starting points of alcohol consumption showed worse mental health (depression and anxiety) and social experiences (homelessness and incarceration history) at study baseline. A steeper increase in volume of alcohol consumption after ages 10–20 was associated with worse health-related quality of life, greater frailty and comorbidities, and greater odds of current heavy drinking. Conclusions: Understanding lifetime alcohol consumption patterns is important in addressing physical and mental health among adult PLWH.

AB  -  This study examined risk and protective outcomes by comparing homeless sexual minority youths to heterosexual homeless youths regarding family, peer behaviors, school, mental health, stigma, discrimination, substance use, and sexual risk behaviors. Structured interviews (N = 147) were conducted with individuals aged 16 to 24 years old in Toronto. Bivariate analyses indicated statistically significant differences between homeless sexual minorities (n = 66) and their heterosexual counterparts (n = 81) regarding all variables: family, peer behaviors, stigma, discrimination, mental health, substance use, and sexual risk behaviors, with the exception of school belonging. Implications for future research are suggested. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Causal attributions of homelessness may affect both the design and acceptance of public policies aimed at improving the situation of homeless people and the strategies that homeless people themselves decide to adopt in order to cope with their situation. This article analyzes the differences in causal attributions of homelessness based on gender, age, nationality, educational background, perceived social class, evolution of personal economic situation, and future expectations between the members of 2 groups: (a) "homeless group", consisting of a representative sample of homeless people in Madrid, Spain (n = 188); and (b) "domiciled group", consisting of a sample of people in Madrid at no risk of homelessness (n = 180), matched for sex, age and nationality. Results show that among domiciled population, women, older people, those without university education, those considering themselves to belong to lower income social classes, those who considered their economic situation to have worsened, and those who expressed negative expectations for the future attributed homelessness to individualistic courses to a greater extent. Meanwhile, among homeless group, younger people, those without university education, those considering themselves to belong to higher social classes, those who perceived their economic situation as having improved in recent years, and those who expressed positive expectations for the future generally attributed homelessness to individualistic courses to a greater extent.

AB  - House of Ruth Maryland is a comprehensive intimate partner violence (IPV) service provider. Our academic-practitioner partnership conducted a prospective, quasi-experimental evaluation (n = 70) of on-site transitional housing and community-based rapid rehousing to meet the safety and stability needs of individuals made homeless because of IPV. By 6-month follow-up, both IPV revictimization and housing instability significantly improved (P < .001). Housing supports through an IPV service provider advanced the dual goals of safety and housing stability for IPV survivors. Safe, affordable housing is an IPV prevention strategy.

AB  - Welfare receipt often is correlated negatively with children's cognitive & behavioral outcomes. Yet, virtually all children in households that receive public assistance are poor, prompting the question of whether poor outcomes are an effect of welfare, a spurious relationship between welfare & child outcomes, or a result of welfare selection. This question is addressed using data on 850 white & 554 African American children, born 1978-1983, whose mothers were drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1992 sample, controlling for poverty & selection into welfare. Controlling for child & maternal characteristics accounts for the majority of bivariate associations between welfare & outcomes among black children. Controlling for poverty does little to change the relationship between welfare & outcomes for black or white children. Controlling for selection into welfare further reduces the relationship between welfare receipt & outcomes among white children & has little discernible effect among black children. 10 Tables, 28 References.

AB  - Homeless, street-dwelling youths are an at-risk population who often use survival behaviors to meet their basic needs. The traditional outreach approach brings services into the streets, yet does not adequately replace the youths' high-risk behaviors. Similarly, job training programs often fail to address the mental health issues that constitute barriers to their productive employment. Drawing on social development principles, the Social Enterprise Intervention (SEI) model is proposed as an alternative approach. The SEI seeks the tripartite effect of employment, service-related, and mental health outcomes for street youths. This article compares existing intervention models and suggests that through the SEI, homeless youths can acquire vocational and business skills, clinical mentorship, and linkages to services that otherwise would not be available to them, given their street-dwelling status.

AB  - Little is known regarding the specific types of service models and collaborations that are necessary to support diverse populations of youth in transition out of homelessness. Transitional supports addressing the complex needs of this population are needed to stabilize the array of housing arrangements that youth access. This study was a pilot randomized controlled trial of one such critical time intervention, called the Housing Outreach Program-Collaboration (HOP-C). HOP-C is a multicomponent, multidisciplinary intervention that provides 6 months of mental health and peer support, along with transitional case management to youth who have transitioned into some form of stable housing out of homelessness. In this trial, 65 youth were randomized to receive HOP-C plus treatment as usual or transitional case management plus treatment as usual. Outcome assessments were completed by 30 treatment and 28 control participants. The findings suggest that this intervention is feasible with mental health, employment or education, and housing metrics favoring HOP-C with odds ratios ranging from 2.28 to 3.18 and better subjective housing stability. Other indicators showed less change. HOP-C appears feasible and should be tested in a fully powered trial, providing the intervention for a duration longer than 6 months. Overall, these data suggest the potential benefit in fostering city-level, multidisciplinary teams sourced from several organizations to support youth transitioning out of homelessness. Pragmatic trial method considerations for this population are also addressed as are the ethical considerations pertinent to engaging highly marginalized youth in clinical trials.

AB  - Objective: In this study we test the effect of a time-limited case management model targeting homeless mothers who are experiencing mental health problems. Adapted from an empirically informed intervention to prevent recurrent homelessness among individuals, the Family Critical Time Intervention (FCTI) supports mothers with children for a 9-month period as they move from homeless shelters into affordable housing. The case management team uses a structured intervention to encourage mothers to create and maintain necessary connections in the community for key family supports. Method: We use a longitudinal randomized controlled trial (N = 210) to test whether homeless mothers referred to FCTI experience greater declines in psychopathology compared with those receiving homeless services-as-usual. All families receive access to affordable housing. Hierarchical linear models examine changes in symptomatology at shelter entry and 3, 9, and 15 months later. Results: Results suggest all homeless mothers report significant and clinically meaningful declines in mental distress over time, regardless of intervention condition. Treatment effects do not vary by prior homelessness experiences or receipt of mental health services. Conclusions: Homelessness presents acute stress for mothers that diminishes over time after families rehouse. In addition, improvements in maternal mental health fail to explain prior findings that associated FCTI with benefits in child and adolescent behavior. Taken together, FCTI with connection to affordable housing provides a useful approach with homeless families; however, additional research needs to articulate mechanisms involved in the intervention.

AB  - Moral, efficiency, and rights-based arguments have sparked widespread acknowledgment in both academic and policy circles that children deserve a special focus in poverty measurement. Children can be considered to have a "differential experience" of poverty in childhood, setting their situation apart from adults as well as from other children depending on their life stage. The European Union (EU) is among those bodies that have recognized the need for child-focused indicators in monitoring poverty and social exclusion and is currently in the process of developing, testing, and comparing single indicators of child well-being across member states. In this article, we seek to add to this debate by providing a micro-analysis of the breadth of child poverty in the EU by analyzing the overlap of deprivations across monetary and multidimensional indicators of poverty. Thereby, we aim to gain insight into the breadth of child poverty and degree of overlap between measures of monetary and multidimensional poverty in the EU. Particular attention will be paid to the investigation of cross-country and cross-domain differences. Using the 2007 wave of the EU-SILC data, we compare the EU monetary "at-risk-of-poverty" indicator to a range of child deprivation indicators at the domain level in four EU member states (Germany, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom). Overall, the article's findings provide a strong call for the need to take a multidimensional approach toward the measurement of child poverty in the EU context. Size and group differences between children faced with income poverty and/or deprivation in other domains are considerable and underline the need to take a broader perspective to identify those who are vulnerable. Overlap analysis of income and domain poverty suggests considerable mismatch across the board, regardless of the particular country under consideration. This suggests a considerable breadth of child poverty in the EU, meaning that deprivation in monetary and non-monetary terms does not seem to be concentrated on a few particular groups but rather spread out across the population, with large numbers of children likely to face deprivation in a few domains. Although dependent on the domain and country under consideration, single parenthood, living in a rented dwelling, low work intensity, and income poverty are found to be significantly and considerably the risk to poverty.

AB  - The focus for this article is child poverty in a Nordic welfare state context. With data from two qualitative studies from Sweden and Norway, we discuss child poverty from the children's point of view, in the framework of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, articles 27 and 28. In article 27, food, housing and clothing are mentioned as particularly important for an adequate standard of living. In poverty studies where children's voices are being heard there has been little focus on these necessities. We find that a few of the children living with economic hardship experience a lack of necessities such as food, housing and clothing. We also explore whether children experience limited possibilities in relation to education. Despite of the state policies recognition of equal opportunities in relation to schooling, we find differences due to economy. In some cases this leads to young people dropping out of school to work. Overall we find that children take responsibility in relation to their families' financial situation. In the final discussion we pay attention to the powerlessness of the children's situation between the parents and the states' responsibilities for providing for the children's basic needs. We argue for the need for a discussion about the children's position between rights and protection. If poor children are loaded with more responsibilities than their peers from better-off families, it will add to the burden of worry and distress in an already complicated situation.

AB  - Adults who were involved in the foster care system may have experienced developmental disruptions that subsequently impacted the acquisition of social networks and independent living skills (Brown &; Wilderson, 2010). Having a mentoring relationship with a non-parental adult is a normative aspect of adolescence and is related to positive developmental outcomes (Langhout, Rhodes, &; Osborne, 2004). Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health data set, this study explored if former foster care involved adults (n=346) between the ages of 18 and 26 experienced higher rates of economic disadvantage and report of lifetime homelessness, and lower rates of mentorship when compared with a matched sample of non-foster care involved adults (n=346). Three chi-square analyses determined that former foster care involved adults were more likely to report economic disadvantage and lifetime homelessness than their peers, and there was no significant difference in reporting mentorship. This study also explored predictors of economic disadvantage for former foster care involved adults. Results from the hierarchal logistic regression revealed that sex, adoption status, abuse by a biological parent, and lifetime homelessness predicted economic disadvantage. The former foster care involved adults who were most likely to experience economic disadvantage were female, never adopted, experienced abuse by a biological parent, and were homeless at some point in their lifetime. Mentorship did not predict or have a moderating effect on reporting economic disadvantage. Findings also indicated that academic disparities existed between former foster care involved adults and their peers, and that academic achievement was related to economic disadvantage.

AB  - On a bright Ohio morning a full month before Halloween, the orange holiday regalia was already out in force at the upscale open-air shopping mall in Perrysburg, ten miles south of Toledo. And in a booth at the local Bob Evans, Mark Redding was sketching a female stick figure to explain the social determinants of health. It's an intuitive and appealing concept-that such basic, nonmedical factors as employment, education, housing quality, and access to transportation, to name just a few, play a far greater role in health outcomes than direct medical care-and it is now widely viewed as self-evident. Far from obvious, however, is how to resolve, much less mitigate, the deleterious impacts of these often debilitating social determinants of health. Redding, fifty-eight, has long, fine grained fingers and the benign mien of a veteran pediatrician, and when he doesn't agree with you, he might push back by saying: "I would nudge you on that." But on the subject of the Pathways Community HUB, the care coordination model he developed with his wife, Sarah Redding, a fifty-seven-year-old physician who specializes in preventive medicine, his tone is messianic. It is, he says, "absolutely potentially transformative." The Reddings' model is rooted in the belief that a meticulous and coordinated attack on an individual's social determinants of health led by a trained, local community health worker can mitigate many negative social determinants and produce better health outcomes for people at high risk. In some cases, says Mark Redding, such an approach can help families break out of the multigenerational cycle of poverty in which they live. It's not that "care coordination" is a novel concept. Indeed, along with "social determinants," it is one of the buzziest phrases in health care today. However, the Pathways HUB model differs from other social determinants models on at least two important counts: First, it manages its clients with community health workers who come from the same neighborhoods as the people they serve. And second, the model's financial framework is premised on a monetary incentive that is realized by care coordination agencies-that is, the community health workers' employers-when HUB clients achieve measurable, positive outcomes in a host of factors, both large and small.Central to the Reddings' model is the targeting of "individual modifiable factors of risk," with risk being defined as a lack of something-be it housing, a medical home, food, employment, or training in parenting skills or nutrition. In other words, risk is any social determinant that leads to an unwanted medical or socioeconomic outcome. Just as important, however, is the notion that these risk factors are linked. An expectant teenage mother at risk for a low-birthweight, preterm delivery who is simultaneously homeless, depressed, and without access to medical care must have all three factors addressed, since fixing one by itself is unlikely to make much difference in the outcome, says Mark Redding. "You can't break people apart and treat their parts."

AB  - In an essay in Critical Social Work, Robert Fairbanks suggests that space perspectives need to be accounted for in social work practice if the profession is to procure a more nuanced understanding of the production of social relationships. Yet, Fairbanks's analysis fails to account for the problematic of a spatialised politics of belonging for racialised subjects, and for the connections between racialising practices and (neo)liberal governance on localized social-spatial relations. This paper addresses these shortcomings by accomplishing three objectives: (1) To introduce a renewed vector of space thesis by borrowing from post-colonial writings; (2) To enliven that frame by critically reading visual images produced within the context of social service agencies in Toronto. I examine how these images attempt to reorient codes of difference and belonging in relationship to the representational and material contexts in which they were produced; and (3) To provoke a Social Work response to its own animation of these theoretical precepts. I argue that client produced representations reposition a practice sight-line away from a positioning of client subjectivity as redeemable only in its neo-liberal guise or as surplus in its democratic value, towards one that allows for an inter-subjective unfolding of identity, place and belonging.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine stressful life events (SLEs) among homeless women and how SLEs were related to patterns and trajectories of homelessness. Specifically, the study aimed to replicate and build upon by Muñoz et al. (2005) by using cluster and discriminant analysis in a sample of 116 homeless women. The sample was classified based on SLEs, and the relationship between the resulting subgroups and sociodemographic characteristics, homeless trajectories, physical and mental health, and social support was examined. The results suggest that the three‐cluster solution was theoretically and structurally meaningful: (a) the “Shorter homelessness trajectories and best health and mental health” subgroup was characterized by low levels of SLEs, a shorter homeless trajectory, lower prevalence of physical and mental health problems, and lower rates of alcohol and substances consumption; (b) the “Early onset of homelessness and poorer health and poorer mental health” subgroup was characterized by a higher prevalence of childhood and adolescence SLEs, an early onset of homelessness and greater chronification, mental health problems, and alcohol consumption; and (c) the “Chronic homelessness and poorest health and mental health” subgroup was mainly characterized by a higher prevalence of typically adulthood SLEs, as well as some SLEs that may be unique to women, a greater number of periods of homelessness, physical health problems, disabilities, and substance misuse. Increased knowledge about the different subgroups and trajectories of homeless women, as well as their specific characteristics and needs, will help us design social services and policies sensitive to all these differences.

AB  - Presents a conceptual model of how poverty jeopardizes childhood & adulthood abilities, drawing on a review of related social science research. Findings reveal that low family income compromises children's physical growth, cognitive development, & socioemotional functioning. It decreases the achievement of children when they are in school & puts them at heightened risk of dropping out of school early. Studies also reveal that low childhood income impairs productivity later in life, partly through limited educational attainment. 3 Tables, 2 Figures, 61 References. Adapted from the source document

AB  - Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) populations exhibit elevated rates of psychiatric disorders compared to heterosexuals, and these disparities emerge early in the life course. We examined the role of exposure to early-life victimization and adversity -- including physical and sexual abuse, homelessness, and intimate partner violence -- in explaining sexual orientation disparities in mental health among adolescents and young adults. Data were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, Wave 3 (2001-2002), a nationally representative survey of adolescents. Participants included gay/lesbian (n = 227), bisexual (n = 245), and heterosexual (n = 13,490) youths, ages 18-27. We examined differences in the prevalence of exposure to child physical or sexual abuse, homelessness or expulsion from one's home by caregivers, and physical and sexual intimate partner violence according to sexual orientation. Next we examined the associations of these exposures with symptoms of psychopathology including suicidal ideation and attempts, depression, binge drinking, illicit drug use, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse. Finally, we determined whether exposure to victimization and adversity explained the association between sexual orientation and psychopathology. Gay/lesbian and bisexual respondents had higher levels of psychopathology than heterosexuals across all outcomes. Gay/lesbian respondents had higher odds of exposure to child abuse and housing adversity, and bisexual respondents had higher odds of exposure to child abuse, housing adversity, and intimate partner violence, than heterosexuals. Greater exposure to these adversities explained between 10 and 20% of the relative excess of suicidality, depression, tobacco use, and symptoms of alcohol and drug abuse among LGB youths compared to heterosexuals. Exposure to victimization and adversity experiences in childhood and adolescence significantly mediated the association of both gay/lesbian and bisexual orientation with suicidality, depressive symptoms, tobacco use, and alcohol abuse. Exposure to victimization in early-life family and romantic relationships explains, in part, sexual orientation disparities in a wide range of mental health and substance use outcomes, highlighting novel targets for preventive interventions aimed at reducing these disparities.

AB  - Children who experience homelessness display substantial variation in outcomes, but little attention has been given to potential mechanisms linking their housing experiences to their functioning. This study explores these mechanisms using qualitative coding of 80 interviews with parents participating in a randomized control trial of housing interventions for families experiencing homelessness. Interviews were conducted an average of 7 months after families entered a homeless shelter, when most families had exited shelters to a variety of other housing options. Many parents described children as faring poorly on behavioral and educational outcomes while in shelters but displaying improvement after leaving the shelter. Parents commonly viewed shelters as contributing to behavioral disruptions, with restored autonomy and routines after exiting shelters contributing to recovery in functioning. Parents offered long-term rental subsidies viewed having a stable, adequate place of their own as helping their children fare better from reduced family stress, improved routines, and changes in children's expectations about stability. Findings indicate the importance of understanding differences in housing stability and quality among families who experience homelessness for how children fare-including differences in how housing interventions affect stability and quality. Policies expanding access to long-term rental subsidies could help improve outcomes for children.

AB  - Future expectations of youth surviving on the streets of Porto Alegre, Brasil, were examined. The sample consisted of 35 boys and 34 girls aged 10-18 (M age 14.4) who participated in a sentence completion task and semi-structured interviews. Responses to two incomplete sentences regarding the future revealed a mismatch between hoped-for and expected events. When completing the sentence, "In the future, I hope..." the majority of youth gave optimistic (but generally non-specific) responses. In contrast, the sentence "For me, the future..." elicited more pessimistic responses. Few gender or age-related differences emerged. Findings are discussed in light of prior research with general populations of adolescents as well as studies of street youth. Taken as a whole, results suggest that life on the street shapes and constrains how youth see their futures. Implications of the findings for policy makers and practitioners are addressed.

AB  - Lebanon is a small country whose citizens are religiously diverse. It is accommodating 1.5 million refugees from Arab countries. Child poverty is a serious social problem, for it affects child development and has negative outcomes for all children affected. Youth poverty constrains youth achievements. Some 1.35 million Lebanese are living below the poverty line, and there are more than 1,500 street children, most of whom are Syrian refugees. High unemployment is another serious social problem, with an estimated 18.7 percent of males and 24.7 percent of females being unemployed. Unemployment among youth leads to lower levels of happiness and well‐being and to feelings of not being accepted in society. Youth unemployment is also associated with drug and alcohol use as well as higher incidences of criminal and antisocial behaviors. The problem of youth is worsening in Lebanon because of Arab youth refugees, but, at the same time, the Lebanese government has not set out any comprehensive and appropriately designed policies that meet Lebanon's specific social, economic, and political problems being experienced.

AB  - Few effective methods of intervention exist for youth at risk for negative life outcomes. One method used successfully with both adults with chronic mental illness and adults with substance abuse problems is strengths-based case management (SBCM). Based on the principles of strengths theory, SBCM aims to assist individuals in identifying and achieving personal goals, with an emphasis on the case manager-client relationship and client self-determination. In the current study, the authors report findings from a feasibility study that implemented SBCM with adolescent runaways. Challenges to implementation, such as financial status, the role of families, abuse and neglect, developmental issues, education, peer relationships, and transportation, are examined. The current findings suggest that it is feasible to successfully implement SBCM with adolescents, but the challenges to application are different with this group compared with adults, given the developmental differences between adolescents and adults.

AB  - Shared decision making (SDM) is the process by which health care providers and patients collaborate to make health care decisions. This collaboration leads to informed decision making and improved outcomes. However, research on SDM specific to the field of youth mental health is scarce. ACCESS Open Minds (ACCESS OM) is a youth mental health research and evaluation project that implemented and evaluated SDM practices within its various activities and operations. The ACCESS OM network spans a diversity of youth mental health settings across Canada, and includes various stakeholders such as youth, family members and carers, clinicians, researchers, and policy makers. The project values all types of knowledge (specifically, experiential, cultural, clinical, and scientific knowledge) as necessary to lead to better health research, care delivery, and outcomes for patients and their communities. Similarly, it acknowledges the lived experience of patients and, family and carers as expertise. Through the integration of SDM practices, ACCESS OM has formulated valuable insights that can be applied to other health problems and settings. This paper, written by youth and family council members, operational staff, and researchers from the project, will share challenges and solutions that arose in the integration of SDM practices within ACCESS OM's knowledge translation strategy, governance structures, clinical contexts, and capacity-building initiatives.

AB  - The coming out process is an important milestone in the lives of homosexual youth. A positive resolution leads to an easier integration into modern American society whereas a poor resolution can lead to multiple social difficulties, including substance use, suicide, homelessness, depression, risk of HIV infection, poor self-esteem, and other issues. Coming out is a concern to the social work community as it is faced with youth on a daily basis in social agencies, group homes, hospitals, schools, and universities. Many models of coming out are available to the practitioner, but only a handful of thew models have been tested empirically, with inconclusive results. A Rites of Passage model is of interest in that this model attempts to integrate social/cultural issues into a psychosocial model of development and ascribe a theoretical framework to the coming out process This project empirically investigated a Rites of Passage model of coming out by means of an anonymous cross-sectional mail survey design. The sample was drawn from a population of male college students, as students typically form their overall sexual identity during college. Male students were selected as them are significant differences between men and women with regards to the coming out process. The sampling site for this project was a large urban university in the Northeast United States, and all registered male students received a mail survey (N = 1850). Students were asked if they would voluntarily interview with the principle investigator. Seventy surveys were returned by mail; seven surveys were removed as they were incomplete or the respondent was heterosexual. A response rate of 3.4% was recorded for the survey (63 surveys). Nine students responded to the request to interview mid five interviews were ultimately completed. The results indicated, using an exploratory factor analysis, that there was a potential three-stage model of coming out as gay, providing preliminary support for a Rites of Passage model. The project also found, via a correlation analysis, that having a satisfying relationship with one's mother, being active in the gay community, having gay political beliefs, and being on a college campus were statistically significant concerning the coming out process for the gay male students. Further, using a Rites of Passage model, an additional correlation analysis was run to investigate practice implications of this three-stage model. Implications of these findings for social work theory, practice, policy and research are discussed.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between a mother's motivation, capacities, and opportunities, and how much supervision her children received. Ninety-five mothers who adequately supervised their children were compared with a demographically comparable sample of 37 mothers who did not. Mothers who provided inadequate supervision were less motivated, had fewer problem-solving and social skills, and were more likely to move, be homeless, and have inadequate housing. No differences were found between the groups on perceived social support. Families with supervision problems tended to have an adult or child in the family with one or more problems. A discriminant analysis showed that less education and poorer problem-solving skills made the largest contribution to the function.

Patients with schizophrenia from the San Juan de Dios Psychiatric Hospital, female students from Almen High School, and participants from their social context (parents, hospital staff, and teachers) were included, using purposeful sampling. Data were collected from 51 participants (15 patients, nine students, 11 hospital staff, six teachers, 10 parents) via non-participant observation, focus groups, informal interviews, researchers’ field notes and patients’ personal diaries and letters. A thematic analysis was performed.Results The themes identified included a) learning to live together: students and patients participate and learn together; b) the perception of the illness and the mentally-ill: the barrier between health and disease is very slim, and society tends to avoid contact with those who are ill; c) change: a transformation takes place in students, in their self-perception, based on the real and intense nature of the experience; d) a trial and an opportunity: patients test their ability to live outside the hospital; e) discharge and readmission: discharge is experienced as both a liberation and a difficulty, whereas relapse and readmission are experienced as failures.Conclusions Our findings can help us to better understand schizophrenia and encourage a more positive approach towards both the illness and those who suffer from it. These results may be used for the development of cohousing programs in controlled environments.

AB  - This study provides a description of the physical, psychological, and substance use problems of adult homeless women who are and are not caring for children. We also examined differences in the characteristics of these two groups of women. Interviews were conducted with 148 homeless women from three mid-sized U.S. cities, 24.3 % of whom were caring for at least one child. Our results showed that women caring for children were more likely to be sheltered and have health insurance. Homeless women caring for children and solitary homeless women were generally similar in terms of substance abuse problems. However, rates of Borderline Personality Disorder were higher among women caring for children than among solitary homeless women. Our results are somewhat consistent with previous research, with the exception of substance abuse problems and mental health problems, which were shown to be equally problematic for all women, regardless of current caregiving status.

AB  - A two-year ethnography conducted among 16 dually diagnosed clients yielded two longitudinal findings. First, four "positive quality of life" factors were strongly correlated with clients' efforts to cease using addictive substances. Second , the study revealed that five "negative background factors" in participants' childhood homes were predictive of long-term continuation of substance use. The implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Smaller groups of victims of violence, abuse, neglect or exploitation – such as male victims of intimate partner violence (IPV), victims of elder abuse, victims of abuse by carers, victims of parent abuse, victims of human trafficking, girls and boys below 18 years engaging in sex work, victims of sexual exploitation by gangs or groups and victims of honour based violence (such as forced marriages and female genital mutilation) – are often in contact with the health care system without being identified as such and frequently do not receive appropriate treatment. To address this problem, two things need to happen: 1) that ALL groups of victims of violence, abuse, neglect or exploitation are explicitly listed in policies and protocols, and 2) that both the similarities as well as the differences between the groups with regard to identification, support and referral – described in this article – are explained, so that health providers are appropriately supported in this important function.

AB  - Following the financial crisis of 2008, the UK government accelerated a number of market-based interventions into public problems. Experimenting with new forms of intervention provided a moment to effectively problematize the public sector as a whole and its budgets, opening up for discussion the basis for making an intervention, and the methods and costs involved. Questions were posed of the apparently irreducible costs associated with supposedly intractable problems of government (such as homelessness, vulnerable children or crime). In particular, crisis and austerity became a means to give new momentum to a series of experimental ways to shape the social investment market that had been under discussion in various forms since at least 2000. Social Impact Bonds form one particular type of intervention. They involve drawing together investors with delivery agencies, the third sector and national and local government, coordinated by a commissioner. In the recent move by the UK government to set up and use Social Impact Bonds, much has been made of the opportunity they represent to introduce competition, efficiency, efficacy, private sector thinking and investment to a range of different social problems. As the first results of these experiments are now emerging, this article reports on a study conducted into a market-based intervention that experiments with the transformation of ‘children at-risk’ into an investment proposition through a Social Impact Bond. The article suggests that the Social Impact Bond can be usefully explored by drawing on Science and Technology Studies (STS) treatments of markets as collective, heterogeneous assemblages. However, in contrast to scholars who focus on market devices, the article argues that the Social Impact Bond in practice operates as something akin to an anti-market device. The article begins with an introduction to Social Impact Bonds. It then explores the means through which market-based competition and an investment proposition were anticipated, but did not emerge through the composition and enactment of the Bond. It concludes with an assessment of the anti-market device and the future of Social Impact Bonds.

AB  - Until there are sufficient resources to end homelessness in the United States, communities will struggle with how to allocate limited homeless services. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requires communities to establish a coordinated assessment system using a standardized tool to prioritize services.1 Until recently, the most widely used tool was the VI-SPDAT (Vulnerability Index-Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool) for single adults or a modification for youths and families.2 The tool assesses individuals' level of vulnerability across their history of housing and homelessness, individual risk factors, socialization and daily functions, and wellness. It then prioritizes people with the highest scores for permanent supportive housing, those with intermediate scores for short-term, rapid-rehousing subsidies, and those with the lowest scores for minimal services. Typically, use of the VI-SPDAT conflates risk assessment with allocation of services, where only the vulnerability score is used to match people to housing and services. The tool has been criticized as invalid and unreliable3 and racially biased,4 but also defended as predicting returns to homelessness.5 There is little justification for the cutoffs between recommended housing options (although, frequently, communities lack sufficient resources to follow these recommendations). Ultimately, widespread concerns led the VI-SPDAT's creators to stop supporting its use.2 This change requires communities to confront both empirical and ethical questions that the availability and near field-wide adoption of a tool, however flawed, allowed them to avoid. To aid communities as they confront these questions, we discuss three issues central to the design of a coordinated assessment processes: risk assessment (what should count as risk?), prioritization (who should get services first?), and matching (who should receive what?). In addition, we draw on bioethical frameworks for allocating scarce medical interventions to inform decisions.

AB  - Background Against a backdrop of more than four decades of war, conflict and insecurity, Afghanistan is recognised as suffering from endemic violence and children are exposed to multiple forms of violence, including at the family and school levels. This paper presents the results of an evaluation of school-based peace education and a community-based intervention to change harmful social norms and practices related to gender and the use of violence in conflict resolution, implemented in Afghanistan with the aim of reducing violence against and between children.Methods The evaluation consisted of a cross-sectional, interrupted time series design with three data collection points over 12 months. Data was collected from students in 11 secondary schools (seven girls’ and four boys’ schools) in Jawzjan province of Afghanistan, with a total of 361 boys and 373 girls sampled at endline. All children were interviewed with a questionnaire developed for the study. Key outcomes included children’s experience of peer violence (both perpetration and victimization) at school, corporal punishment both at home and at school, and observation of family violence. Other outcomes included children’s gender equitable attitudes, attitudes towards child punishment, depression and school performance.Results Between baseline and endline evaluation points, there were significant reductions in various forms of violence at the school level, including both boys’ and girls’ past month experience of peer violence victimization, peer violence perpetration, and corporal punishment by teachers. There were also significant reductions in boys’ and girls’ experience of corporal punishment at home and observation of family violence, with a particularly strong effect observed among girls. Both boys and girls had significantly more equitable gender attitudes and significantly less violence-supportive attitudes in relation to children’s punishment, and significantly fewer symptoms of depression. Girls’ school attendance was also significantly higher at endline.Discussion To our knowledge this is the first time that a peace education program has been evaluated in Afghanistan, with or without a community intervention to change harmful social norms and practices related to gender and the use of violence for conflict resolution. The evaluation suggests that the intervention may have led to a reduction in various forms of violence, including children’s peer violence, corporal punishment of children both at school and at home, and in children’s reports of domestic violence against women at the household level.

AB  - The scaling out of Housing First (HF) programs was examined in six Canadian communities, in which a multi‐component HF training and technical assistance (TTA) was provided. Three research questions were addressed: (a) What were the outcomes of the TTA in terms of the development of new, sustained, or enhanced programs, and fidelity to the HF model? (b) How did the TTA contribute to implementation and fidelity? and (c) What contextual factors facilitated or challenged implementation and fidelity? A total of 14 new HF programs were created, and nine HF programs were sustained or enhanced. Fidelity assessments for 10 HF programs revealed an average score of 3.3/4, which compares favorably with other HF programs during early implementation. The TTA influenced fidelity by addressing misconceptions about the model, encouraging team‐based practice, and facilitating case‐based dialogue on site specific implementation challenges. The findings were discussed in terms of the importance of TTA for enhancing the capacities of the HF service delivery system—practitioners, teams, and communities—while respecting complex community contexts, including differences in policy climate across sites. Policy climate surrounding accessibility of housing subsidies, and use of Assertive Community Treatment teams (vs. Intensive Case Management) were two key implementation issues.

AB  - Living in poor and segregated neighborhoods has detrimental effects on children's life chances. In an attempt to improve poor children's outcomes, the Chicago Child-Parent Center (CPC) program engages parents and their children in kindergarten and the primary grades to enhance academic achievement. This study looks further at the children's social and emotional development. In particular, it examines the moderating effect of poverty and segregation and the program's ability to enhance developmental outcomes for youth in early adolescence. Using a quasi-experimental research design, findings show that, above and beyond the main CPC impacts, those children living in high poverty and highly segregated areas fare additionally well through their CPC program participation. Effect sizes range from about 0.15 to about 0.40, depending on the outcome. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Children rely on their parents or other primary caregivers to support the neurodevelopmental underpinnings of resilience, including social and emotional skills and neurocognitive executive functions. When adversity compounds a child’s risk for poor outcomes, the functioning and wellbeing of parents may add to, or buffer children from, negative impacts. With a sample of 231 children ages 3–5 and their parents experiencing homelessness, we screened parents for depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTS), and overreactive parenting and assessed how these factors were associated with children’s neurodevelopment. We used confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling to identify a latent variable of caregiver distress. Results are displayed as standardized coefficients to increase the interpretability of the latent variables, rendering them in standard deviation units. Key findings indicate significant associations between caregiver mental health and multiple domains of child development. Results indicate that a one unit increase in parent distress was negatively associated with child neurodevelopmental functioning equivalent to several months delay. Within the parent functioning construct, depression and PTS showed strong loadings, while overreactive parenting was moderately associated. This represents a substantial difference in the real lives of parents and children experiencing homelessness. Implications for practice and policy and the need for two-generational and family-centered approaches are discussed.HighlightsParental traumatic stress was negatively associated child self-regulation skills in a sample of families experiencing homelessness.Parent depression was the strongest predictor of child neurodevelopmental delays, and post-trauma stress symptoms were moderately correlated with child neurodevelopmental outcomes.Overreactive parenting was moderately correlated with child neurodevelopmental functioning.Results support a family centered approach to address family homelessness including early screening of all family members, and access to support and treatment for parents to lower child developmental risks.

AB  - Researchers have long known that poverty in childhood is linked with a range of negative adult socioeconomic outcomes, from lower educational achievement and behavioral problems to lower earnings in the labor market. But few researchers have explored whether exposure to a disadvantaged background affects immigrant children and native children differently. George Borjas uses Current Population Survey (CPS) data on two specific indicators of poverty-the poverty rate and the rate of participation in public assistance programs-to begin answering that question. He finds that immigrant children have significantly higher rates both of poverty and of program participation than do native children. Nearly half of immigrant children are being raised in households that receive some type of public assistance, compared with roughly one-third of native children. Although the shares of immigrant and native children living in poverty are lower, the rate for immigrant children is nonetheless about 15 percentage points higher than that for native children-about the same as the gap in public assistance. Poverty and program participation rates among different groups of immigrant children also vary widely, depending in part on place of birth (foreign- or U.S.-born), parents (immigrant or native), and national origin. According to the CPS data, these native-immigrant differences persist into young adulthood. In particular, the program participation and poverty status of immigrant children is strongly correlated with their program participation and poverty status when they become young adults. But it is not possible, says Borjas, to tell whether the link results from a set of permanent factors associated with specific individuals or groups that tends to lead to "good" or "bad" outcomes systematically over time or from exposure during childhood to adverse socioeconomic outcomes, such as poverty or welfare dependency. Future research must explore the causal impact of childhood poverty on immigrant adult outcomes and why it might differ between immigrant and native families. Developing successful policies to address problems caused by the intergenerational breeding of poverty and program participation in the immigrant population depends on understanding this causal mechanism.

AB  - This study examined whether children who become homeless differ from other low-income children in their mental health service use before and after their first homeless episode, and to what extent homelessness is associated with an increased likelihood of mental health service use. Differences between children with and without new onset of sheltered homelessness in the use of mental health services emerged following homelessness and widened over time. Sheltered homelessness and foster care placement history were associated with increased odds of receiving inpatient and ambulatory mental health services. Findings underscore the importance of collaborations between homeless assistance, foster care, and mental healthcare in efforts to mitigate family homelessness and collateral needs among homeless children.

AB  - This article summarizes physical health, mental health, and substance abuse problems of users of four of Detroit's largest homeless shelters. Shelter users with mental illness or substance abuse problems were compared with those without these problems. Alcohol abusers were significantly more likely to have low blood pressure, symptoms of liver disease, and a tuberculosis treatment history. No health differences were found for those with or without a history of psychiatric hospitalization. Contrary to expectations, few gender differences were found. Aside from the obvious need for low-income housing, comprehensive and integrated treatment approaches from health care, mental health, and substance abuse agencies are needed to help homeless individuals. Social workers need to become more directly involved in service and policy issues for this vulnerable population.

AB  - The Department of Education’s (ED) definition of homelessness includes any child who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence, but the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) uses a narrower definition that excludes doubled-up families. These definitions determine how resources are prioritized for families, yet we know very little about the differences in risks faced by children identified by these departments. We leverage a data linkage between public schools and homeless management information systems in Minnesota to provide novel evidence on the educational risks faced by children identified as homeless by ED and HUD. We find that ED-identified-homeless and HUD-identified-homeless children experience comparable increases in chronic absenteeism and school instability in the year they experience homelessness, challenging the popular conception that doubled-up families face lower educational risks. Using these findings, we discuss strategies to integrate homelessness data better, assess needs, and prioritize resources for children experiencing homelessness.

AB  - The delivery systems for caring for dependent children have undergone a radical transformation in Reform-era China. Beginning in the mid-1980s, a dramatic resurgence in the number of abandoned infants as well as homeless youths from rural to urban areas placed great strains on the existing framework of state-run institutions for the young. China's Civil Affairs branch has responded to the crisis by embracing a policy of 'multi-approachism'[CJK characters removed.] that places primacy on local experimentation and initiative. Civil Affairs workers have expressed the need to 'societalize'[CJK characters removed.] social welfare work, in which the government works hand-in-hand with both outside organizations and Chinese families to provide a better future for at-risk children. These findings suggest that societalization has led not to the privatization of services or the withdrawal of the state, but rather to the formation of creative partnerships between government and nongovernment entities in aiding the dependent child. Throughout the post-Mao period, we can also observe a paradigmatic shift from institution-based care to a family-centered approach that aims at providing the disadvantaged youngster with the warmth and love of the kin unit.

AB  - ObjectivesTo assess the global prevalence estimates of depressive symptoms, dysthymia and major depressive disorders (MDDs) among homeless people.DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.Data sourcesDatabases including PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were systematically searched up to February 2020 to identify relevant studies that have reported data on the prevalence of depressive symptoms, dysthymia and MDDs among homeless people.Eligibility criteriaOriginal epidemiological studies written in English that addressed the prevalence of depressive problems among homeless people.Data extraction and synthesisA random-effect meta-analysis was performed to pool the prevalence estimated from individual studies. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were employed to compare the prevalence across the groups as well as to identify the source of heterogeneities. The Joanna Briggs Institute’s quality assessment checklist was used to measure the study quality. Cochran’s Q and the I2 test were used to assess heterogeneity between the studies.ResultsForty publications, including 17 215 participants, were included in the final analysis. This meta-analysis demonstrated considerably higher prevalence rates of depressive symptoms 46.72% (95% CI 37.77% to 55.90%), dysthymia 8.25% (95% CI 4.79% to 11.86%), as well as MDDs 26.24% (95% CI 21.02% to 32.22%) among homeless people. Our subgroup analysis showed that the prevalence of depressive symptoms was high among younger homeless people (<25 years of age), whereas the prevalence of MDD was high among older homeless people (>50 years of age) when compared with adults (25–50 years).ConclusionThis review showed that nearly half, one-fourth and one-tenth of homeless people are suffering from depressive symptoms, dysthymia and MDDs, respectively, which are notably higher than the reported prevalence rates in the general population. The findings suggest the need for appropriate mental health prevention and treatment strategies for this population group.

AB  -  Despite the increase in consumer-driven interventions for homeless and mentally ill individuals, there is little evidence that these programs enhance psychological outcomes. This study followed 197 homeless and mentally ill adults who were randomized into one of two conditions: a consumer-driven "Housing First" program or "treatment as usual" requiring psychiatric treatment and sobriety before housing. Proportion of time homeless, perceived choice, mastery, and psychiatric symptoms were measured at six time points. Results indicate a direct relationship between Housing First and decreased homelessness and increased perceived choice; the effect of choice on psychiatric symptoms was partially mediated by mastery. The strong and inverse relationship between perceived choice and psychiatric symptoms supports expansion of programs that increase consumer choice, thereby enhancing mastery and decreasing psychiatric symptoms.

AB  - Background Ghana has experienced recent polio outbreaks. Behavioral insights can be used to understand behavior and create demand for the polio vaccine.Methods This cross-sectional study is based on an interactive mobile phone survey that explored factors influencing the uptake of the polio vaccine among Ghanaian mothers with children younger than five years old. The survey also explores the mothers’ intention to vaccinate their children in the future as well as an experiment with short polio vaccine voice message nudges to identify the most effective message frames in encouraging vaccination. The study sample was drawn from volunteers from a mobile service platform. Linear probability model regressions with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates were used to analyze the data.Results In total, data from 708 caregivers was assessed. Out of the sample, 35% (n = 250) had not vaccinated their children against polio, around 8% (n = 53) of respondents stated they did not plan to do so, while 28% expressed intent to do so during the next polio vaccination campaign. Higher vaccination of children against polio, i.e. better uptake of the polio vaccine, appeared to be associated with children’s caregivers knowing that polio causes paralysis (with a coefficient of 0.13 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.24), i.e. 13% more likely than not to have their child vaccinated). Higher vaccine uptake also appeared to be associated with the perception that the polio vaccine is safe (with a coefficient of 0.11 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.22), i.e. 11% more likely than not to have their child vaccinated). Another factor in increasing vaccine uptake is whether caregivers receive support from healthcare workers with a coefficient of 0.11 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.20), i.e. 11% more likely than not to have their child vaccinated. Crucially, difficulty accessing the polio vaccine appeared to be associate with a negative change in vaccine uptake (with a coefficient of -0.16 (95% CI: -0.23, -0.08), i.e. 16% less likely to have their child vaccinated). Satisfaction with the information provided by vaccinators was also associated with better vaccine uptake (with a coefficient of 0.12 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.20) i.e. 12% more likely than not to have their child vaccinated); and having seen or heard something negative about the polio vaccine with a coefficient of 0.10 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.17), i.e. 10% more likely than not to have their child vaccinated. The social norms message frame was statistically significant with a coefficient of 0.06 (95% CI: -0.004, 012).Conclusion The findings from this study suggest that most women with children under the age of 5 appear to have vaccinated their children against polio. Many more caregivers express an intention to vaccinate their children, never having done so before. The behavior and the intention to vaccinate are both driven by a number of factors that must be addressed to create demand for the polio vaccine. Targeted message frames appeared to be statistically significant drivers of vaccine uptake. However, more research is required to understand how they impact vaccine behavior and future intention for vaccination.

AB  - Children's school enjoyment and satisfaction with their teachers is crucial to their quality of life. Still, we have little knowledge about what shapes positive outcomes in this respect, and to what extent groups of children and youth differ from each other. This article compares immigrant children with Norwegian children from low-income families and with a reference group of children from normal-income families. The children were interviewed at age 10 -12 years, and again at age 13 -15 years; thus, we can follow changes over time. Immigrant children from income-poor families express significantly higher school and teacher satisfaction than any other category of 10 -12-year-olds. However, for the 13 -15-year-olds, there are no systematic differences between group averages, but there are more signs of polarisation among low-income immigrant children. Explanations for these patterns are sought in the literature on social capital in immigrant families. Accepted for publication March 18, 2008. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Critical reading of much of the research on street children shows that many writers regularly disregard their own findings in favor of predetermined conclusions based on largely Northern hemisphere, middle-class mores. This article highlights some of these under-reported findings and suggests three reasons why they may be overlooked: (adult) society's fear of the children of the poor; differences between Northern and Southern constructs of childhood; and ethnocentric premises of developmental psychology. It is concluded that if, instead of regarding street children negatively, their strengths are examined, then, in effect, their way of life can be seen as a liberation movement empowering them to surmount their poverty. Some recommendations for collective action based on this thesis follow.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  -  A disproportionate number of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth experience homelessness each year in the United States. LGBT youth who are homeless have particularly high rates of mental health and substance use problems, suicidal acts, violent victimization, and a range of HIV risk behaviors. Given the intense needs of LGBT youth experiencing homelessness, it is imperative to understand their unique experiences and develop responsive practices and policies. The range and severity of health risks vary across subgroups of all homeless LGBT youth, and because the population is nonhomogeneous, their particular needs must be identified and addressed. Thus, the purpose of this article is to review the causes of homelessness among LGBT youth, discuss the mental health and victimization risks faced by this population, address differences among homeless LGBT subgoups, and recommend effective interventions and best practices. The authors conclude by discussing promising future research and public policy directions.

AB  - Government agencies use varying criteria in defining homelessness. While scholars debate over and use different definitions of homelessness, little research has explored the impacts the definition has on perceived problem severity and the types of communities receiving aid. I first explore four definitions of child and youth homelessness used by United States’ federal agencies. I then use panel data for school districts, which report homelessness by subgroup, to analyze how the definition of homelessness changes its prevalence and leads to disparate impacts. I find the definition of homelessness including students living doubled-up leads to a higher growth rate. Definitions also change which districts have high rates of homelessness and characteristics of these districts, suggesting resources following students experiencing homelessness go to different types of communities. Scholars should consider how a problem is defined, differences in the measurement used between studies, and how the definition affects where resources go.

AB  - This study examined the impact on children of services delivered through a collaborative initiative designed to provide supports to working poor families who are homeless or at immediate risk of becoming homeless. Overall, a number of positive findings can serve to inform the development of promising intervention strategies for children in homeless families and highlight areas for further research. Along with improved housing status, there was a statistically significant improvement in the economic self-sufficiency of the families served, regardless of whether they completed the full programme cycle. In addition, youth self-report data indicated significant improvements in externalizing and internalizing behaviour. The ability to combine programme data with school data for participating children also made it possible to explore school performance outcomes. Although these results did not indicate a change in participants' levels of attendance or reading performance, there was a statistically significant improvement in students' math scores. Moreover, when participating children were compared with a group of students matched on their level of academic performance at baseline who had not received housing or homeless services, no significant differences were detected between groups post-intervention, indicating that services may help reduce the risk of homeless students' falling further behind their peers academically.

AB  - Background: Children of street-connected women in Kenya are at risk of child maltreatment. There have been increasing calls for positive parenting programs for parents experiencing homelessness, however never has one been implemented with this population. We therefore adapted the evidence-based Parenting for Lifelong Health for Young Children program using participatory methods, and piloted the adapted program with street-connected mothers in Kenya. Objectives: To (a) determine if the adapted program was feasible and acceptable with street-connected mothers, and (b) assess indicative effects on child maltreatment, positive parenting, and parental stress. Participants and setting: Two groups of 15 mothers (ages 19+, and 20−) participated between June-July 2018 in Eldoret, Kenya. Participants were eligible if they (a) were the mother of at least one child and (b) self-identified as street-connected. Methods: Feasibility was measured via enrollment, attendance, drop-out rates, and engagement in take-away activities. Focus groups explored program acceptability and program outcomes. Self-report surveys assessed pre-post changes in child maltreatment, parental stress, parental sense of inefficacy, and positive parenting practices. Results: 70% of participants attended >3/4 of sessions, 10% dropped out, and >50% of take-away activities were completed. Participants reported high acceptability and requested its continuation for themselves and other parents. There was an increase in supporting good behaviour (t(21) = 8.15, p < .000) and setting limits (t(18) = 10.03, p < .000); a reduction in physical abuse (t(23) = −2.15, p = .042) and parental stress (t(22) = −7.08, p < .000); results for parental inefficacy were not statistically significant (t(22) = 0.15, p = .882). Conclusions: The adapted program is feasible and acceptable to street-connected mothers, and may reduce child maltreatment and parental stress, and increase positive parenting. Further research should test program effectiveness.

AB  - Purpose: This study examined whether differences exist among women with mental health issues who had either young, adult, or no children in relation to their individual and social vulnerabilities, health, and quality of life. Methods: The design of this study was a secondary quantitative analysis of data extracted from a larger Canadian 5-year study focused on mental health and housing. This study's sample included 234 female psychiatric consumer/survivors: 108 (46%) women reported having no children, 68 (29%) had at least one child younger than 18 years of age, and 58 (25%) had children 18 years of age or older. The women completed structured interviews between 2004 and 2006. Findings: Seventy-nine percent of mothers were separated from their young children. In comparison with women with older children and those without children, women with young children were more often homeless, had fewer strengths/resources, greater physical but lower cognitive/intellectual functioning, and a low perception of quality of life regarding their financial situation. In addition, women with young children reported the greatest problem with substance use and poorest quality of life regarding daily activities, health, and overall quality of life. These results, however, were mediated by the confounding effects of housing. No differences were identified between groups regarding utilization of health and social services. Conclusion: These findings support the need for early integrated health and social interventions that assist women achieve their well-being.

AB  - Objective:  This study examined factors that influenced caregiver status for African-American mothers who use crack cocaine but are not receiving drug treatment and participated in an HIV prevention study in North Carolina. Method:  Caregiver mothers who were living with at least one of their children at intake (n = 257) were compared with non-Caregivers who were separated from all of their children (n = 378). Bivariate analyses and logistic regression were used to compare these mothers at intake on current drug use, risky sex practices, psychological symptoms, victimization, and aggression. Results:  Compared with Caregiver mothers, non-Caregivers reported higher frequencies of drug use, risky sex practices, psychological distress, and victimization experiences. Caregiver mothers were more likely than non-Caregiver mothers to have health insurance, but were less likely to have received drug treatment. Logistic regression found that non-Caregiver mothers were significantly more likely than Caregiver mothers to be older, to have been physically abused as children, to trade sex more frequently, to be homeless, and to have no health insurance. Recent crack use, psychological symptoms, and victimization were not significantly related to caregiver status. Conclusions:  Findings that socio-environmental factors were more strongly associated with caregiver status than crack use underscore the importance of contextual issues such as housing, victimization history, and resources in serving maternal crack users. Community outreach and interventions that engage mothers who use drugs and live with their children may be more effective strategies than formal office-based services to link mothers who use crack and their children to needed drug treatment and family and child services.

AB  - Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), are used to compare estimates of the effects of long-term poverty (based on a 13-year average of income) vs poverty based on a single year of income on child development. Findings reveal substantial developmental deficits among children who, on average, are poor over a number of years relative to those who are not. These deficits are approximately twice as large according to the long-term income measure as compared to those based on the single-year measure, & are not explained by differences in maternal education, family structure, maternal behaviors during pregnancy, infant health, nutritional status, or age of mother at first birth. However, an index of the home environment accounts for 33%-50% of the developmental disadvantages (net of other factors) of children who experience long-term poverty. 5 Tables, 4 Appendixes, 42 References.

AB  - Background Child marriage is a human rights violation disproportionately affecting girls in lower- and middle-income countries and has serious public health implications. In Ghana, one in five girls marry before their 18th birthday and one in 20 girls is married before her 15th birthday. This paper uses a unique dataset from Northern Ghana to examine the association between child marriage and adverse outcomes for women among a uniquely vulnerable population.Methods Baseline data from on ongoing impact evaluation of a government-run cash transfer programme was used. The sample consisted of 1349 ever-married women aged 20–29 years from 2497 households in the Northern and Upper East regions of Ghana. We estimated a series of ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression models to examine associations of child marriage with health, fertility, contraception, child mortality, social support, stress and agency outcomes among women, controlling for individual characteristics and household-level factors.Results Child marriage in this sample was associated with increased odds of poorer health, as measured by difficulties in daily activities (OR = 2.08; CI 1.28–3.38 among women 20–24 years and OR = 1.58; CI 1.19–2.12 among women 20–29 years), increased odds of child mortality among first-born children (OR = 2.03; CI 1.09–3.77 among women 20–24 years) and lower odds of believing that one’s life is determined by their own actions (OR = 0.42; CI 0.25–0.72 among women 20–24 years and OR = 0.54; CI 0.39–0.75 among women 20–29 years). Conversely, child marriage was associated with lower levels of reported stress (regression coefficient = − 1.18; CI -1.84–-0.51 among women 20–29 years).Conclusions Child marriage is common in Northern Ghana and is associated with poor health, increased child mortality, and low agency among women in this sample of extremely poor households. While not much is known about effective measures to combat child marriage in the context of Ghana, programmes that address key drivers of early marriage such as economic insecurity and school enrolment at the secondary level, should be examined with respect to their effectiveness at reducing early marriage.Trial registration: Registered in the Registry for International Development Impact Evaluations (RIDIE) on 01 July 2015, with number RIDIE-STUDY-ID-55942496d53af.
