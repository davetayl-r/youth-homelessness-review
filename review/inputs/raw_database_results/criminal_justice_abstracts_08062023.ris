AB  - Adolescent and young adult health, development, and behavior lay a foundation for future population health. Increasing rates of young adult homelessness mean there is a need for research which generates evidence to support a stronger focus on population-level prevention. Using longitudinal data from a population-based sample of young adults participating in the cross-nationally matched International Youth Development Study, we examined adolescent antecedents of young adult homelessness in Washington State in the USA and in Victoria, Australia. Participants were surveyed using a modified version of the Communities That Care youth survey. Analyses of prospective, longitudinal data from 1945 participants, recruited as state-representative secondary school samples at grade 7 (average age 13, 2002) and longitudinally compared at young adulthood (average age 25, 2014), showed that young adults in Washington State reported higher rates of past year homelessness (5.24%) compared to those in Victoria (3.25%). Path modeling showed less positive family management strategies at age 13 uniquely increased risk for age 25 homelessness. This effect remained after accounting for age 15 antecedents in peer-group, school, and community environments. Friends' drug use, school suspension, academic failure, and low neighborhood attachment at age 15 mediated the association between less positive family management strategies at age 13 and age 25 homelessness. Despite observing some cross-national differences in levels of family, peer-group, school, and community antecedents, we found that these factors equally increased risk for age 25 homelessness in both states, suggesting similar cross-national influences for young adult homelessness. The findings indicate cross-nationally common adolescent antecedents for young adult homelessness that could be targeted by prevention strategies across international settings.

T1  - Prevalence and Correlates of Non-Dating Sexual Violence, Sexual Dating Violence, and Physical Dating Violence Victimization among U.S. High School Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences Survey, United States, 2021.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic created an environment of disruption and adversity for many adolescents. We sought to establish the prevalence of non-dating sexual violence, sexual dating violence, and physical dating violence victimization among adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate whether experiences of disruption and adversity placed adolescents at greater risk for these forms of interpersonal violence. We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Adolescent Behavior and Experiences Survey, collected January to June 2021 from a nationally representative sample of U.S. high school students (N = 7,705). Exposures included abuse by a parent; economic, housing, and food and nutrition insecurity; interpersonal connectedness; and personal well-being. Among female students, 8.0% experienced non-dating sexual violence; 12.5% experienced sexual dating violence; and 7.7% experienced physical dating violence. Among male students, 2.2% experienced non-dating sexual violence; 2.4% experienced sexual dating violence; and 4.9% experienced physical dating violence. Among female students, both emotional and physical abuse by a parent was related to non-dating sexual violence, emotional abuse was related to sexual dating violence, and physical abuse was related to physical dating violence. Among males, emotional abuse by a parent was related to physical dating violence and physical abuse by a parent was related to sexual dating violence. Hunger was associated with sexual and physical dating violence among female students and homeless was associated with physical dating violence among male students. Although there were differences by sex, abuse by a parent, hunger, and homelessness created precarity that may have increased the likelihood that adolescents would be exposed to risky peer or dating relationships. Adolescents need support that stops and prevents experiences of non-dating sexual and dating violence connected to interventions that address adversities experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - HIV researchers use short messaging service (SMS)-based surveys to monitor health behaviors more closely than what would be possible with in-person assessment. Benefits are tempered by nonresponse to completing surveys. Understanding response patterns and their associated study participant characteristics would guide more tailored use of SMS-based surveys for HIV studies. We examined response to weekly 7-item SMS surveys administered as part of an HIV prevention trial. Using Mixture hidden Markov models (MHMM), we identified the underlying response patterns shared by subgroups of participants over time and quantified the association between these response patterns and participant characteristics. Three underlying response patterns were identified; responders, responders with phone-related errors, and non-responders. Non-responders versus responders were more likely to be younger, male, cis-gender, Black and Latinx participants with histories of homelessness, incarceration, and social support service utilization. Responders with phone-related errors compared to non-responders were more likely to be Black, Latinx, female, students, and have a history of incarceration and social support service utilization. More nuanced results from MHMM analyses better inform what strategies to use for increasing SMS response rates, including assisting in securing phone ownership/service for responders with phone-related errors and identifying alternative strategies for non-responders. Actively collecting and monitoring non-delivery notification data available from SMS gateway service companies offers another opportunity to identify and connect with participants when they are willing but unable to respond during follow-up.

AB  - Background: At‐risk youth may be defined as a diverse group of young people in unstable life circumstances, who are currently experiencing or are at risk of developing one or more serious problems. At‐risk youth are often very unlikely to seek out help for themselves within the established venues, as their adverse developmental trajectories have installed a lack of trust in authorities such as child protection agencies and social workers. To help this population, a number of outreach programmes have been established seeking to help the young people on an ad hoc basis, meaning that the interventions are designed to fit the individual needs of each young person rather than as a one‐size‐fits‐all treatment model. The intervention in this review is targeted outreach work which may be (but does not have to be) multicomponent programmes in which outreach may be combined with other services. Objectives: The main objective of this review was to answer the following research questions: What are the effects of outreach programmes on problem/high‐risk behaviour of young people between 8 and 25 years of age living in OECD countries? Are they less likely to experience an adverse outcome such as school failure or drop‐out, runaway and homelessness, substance and/or alcohol abuse, unemployment, long‐term poverty, delinquency and more serious criminal behaviour? Search Methods: We identified relevant studies through electronic searches of bibliographic databases, governmental and grey literature repositories, hand search in specific targeted journals, citation tracking, and Internet search engines. The database searches were carried out in September 2020 and other resources were searched in October and November 2021. We searched to identify both published and unpublished literature, and reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews were searched. Selection Criteria: The intervention was targeted outreach work which may have been combined with other services. Young people between 8 and 25 years of age living in OECD countries, who either have experienced or is at‐risk of experiencing an adverse outcome were eligible. Our primary focus was on measures of problem/high‐risk behaviour and a secondary focus was on social and emotional outcomes. All study designs that used a well‐defined control group were eligible for inclusion. Studies that utilised qualitative approaches were not included. Data Collection and Analysis: The total number of potentially relevant studies constituted 17,659 hits. A total of 16 studies (17 different interventions) met the inclusion criteria. Only five studies could be used in the data synthesis. Eight studies could not be used in the data synthesis as they were judged to have critical risk of bias and, in accordance with the protocol, were excluded from the meta‐analysis on the basis that they would be more likely to mislead than inform. Two studies (three interventions) did not provide enough information enabling us to calculate an effect size and standard error, and one study did not provide enough information to assess risk of bias. Meta‐analysis of all outcomes were conducted on each conceptual outcome separately. All analyses were inverse variance weighted using random effects statistical models incorporating both the sampling variance and between study variance components into the study level weights. Random effects weighted mean effect sizes were calculated using 95% confidence intervals. Too few studies were included to carry out any sensitivity analyses. Main Results: Four of the five studies used for meta analysis were from the USA and one was from Canada. The timespan in which included studies were carried out was 32 years, from 1985 to 2017; on average the intervention year was 2005. The average number of participants in the analysed interventions was 116, ranging from 30 to 346 and the average number of controls was 81, ranging from 32 to 321. At most, the results from two studies could be pooled in a single meta‐analysis. It was only possible to pool the outcomes drug (other than marijuana) use, marijuana use and alcohol use each at two different time points (one and 3 months follow up). At 1 month follow up the weighted averages varied between zero and 0.05 and at 3 months follow up between −0.17 and 0.07. None of them were statistically significant. In addition, a number of other outcomes were reported in a single study only. Authors' Conclusions: Overall, there were too few studies included in any of the meta‐analyses in order for us to draw any conclusion concerning the effectiveness of outreach. The vast majority of studies were undertaken in the USA. The dominance of the USA as the main country in which outreach interventions meeting our inclusion criteria have been evaluated using rigorous methods and within our specific parameters clearly limits the generalisability of the findings. None of the studies, however, was considered to be of overall high quality in our risk of bias assessment and the process of excluding studies with critical risk of bias from the meta‐analysis applied in this review left us with only five of a total of 16 possible studies to synthesise. Further, because too few studies reported results on the same type of outcome at most two studies could be combined in a particular meta‐analysis. Given the limited number of rigorous studies available from countries other than the USA, it would be natural to consider conducting a series of randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of outreach for at‐risk youth in countries outside the USA. The trial(s) should be designed, conducted and reported according to methodological criteria for rigour in respect of internal and external validity to achieve robust results and preferably reporting a larger number of outcomes.

AB  - Economic vulnerability, such as homelessness and unemployment, contributes to HIV risk among U.S. racial minorities. Yet, few economic-strengthening interventions have been adapted for HIV prevention in this population. This study assessed the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial of a 20-week microenterprise intervention for economically-vulnerable African-American young adults. Engaging MicroenterprisE for Resource Generation and Health Empowerment (EMERGE) aimed to reduce sexual risk behaviors and increase employment and uptake of HIV preventive behaviors. The experimental group received text messages on job openings plus educational sessions, mentoring, a start-up grant, and business and HIV prevention text messages. The comparison group received text messages on job openings only. Primary feasibility objectives assessed recruitment, randomization, participation, and retention. Secondary objectives examined employment, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV preventive behaviors. Outcome assessments used an in-person pre- and post-intervention interview and a weekly text message survey. Several progression criteria for a definitive trial were met. Thirty-eight participants were randomized to experimental (n = 19) or comparison group (n = 19) of which 95% were retained. The comparison intervention enhanced willingness to be randomized and reduced non-participation. Mean age of participants was 21.0 years; 35% were male; 81% were unemployed. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of experimental participants completed ≥ 70% of intervention activities, and 74% completed ≥ 50% of intervention activities. Participation in intervention activities and outcome assessments was highest in the first half (~ 10 weeks) of the study. Seventy-one percent (71%) of weekly text message surveys received a response through week 14, but responsiveness declined to 37% of participants responding to ≥ 70% of weekly text message surveys at the end of the study. The experimental group reported higher employment (from 32% at baseline to 83% at week 26) and lower unprotected sex (79% to 58%) over time compared to reported changes in employment (37% to 47%) and unprotected sex (63% to 53%) over time in the comparison group. Conducting this feasibility trial was a critical step in the process of designing and testing a behavioral intervention. Development of a fully-powered effectiveness trial should take into account lessons learned regarding intervention duration, screening, and measurement. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - Homelessness is associated with a range of negative health and behavioral outcomes, yet life-course pathways to homelessness from adolescence to early adulthood are not well-documented. This study asks to what extent do early-mid adolescent risk and protective factors predict young adult homelessness, and whether the predictive nature of these factors is similar in Victoria, Australia, and Washington State in the USA. As part of the International Youth Development Study, adolescents were recruited as state representative secondary school samples at grade 7 (age 13, 2002) and longitudinally compared at average age 25. Higher rates of past year homelessness were reported by Washington State (5.24%), compared to Victorian young adults (3.25%). Although some cross-state differences in levels of adolescent demographic, individual, family, peer group, school, and community predictors were found, cross-state comparisons showed these factors were equally predictive of young adult homelessness in both states. In univariate analyses, most adolescent risk and protective factors were significant predictors. Unique multivariate adolescent predictors associated with young adult homelessness included school suspension (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.76) and academic failure (AOR = 1.94). No significant unique protective effects were found. Prevention and intervention efforts that support adolescents' academic engagement may help in addressing young adult homelessness. The similar cross-state profile of adolescent predictors suggests that programs seeking to support academic engagement may influence risk for homelessness into young adulthood in both states. The similarity in life-course pathways to homelessness suggests that the USA and Australia can profitably translate prevention and intervention efforts to reduce homelessness while continuing to identify modifiable predictors.

AB  - This seminal study from Turkey investigates sexual abuse (SA) victimization, psychological symptoms, and hopelessness in female adolescents with runaway behavior. A total of 76 female adolescent participants aged 15–18 completed the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). Among these adolescents, 63.1% (n = 48) were victims of SA, 61.8% (n = 47) had a Global Severity Index (GSI) T-score of 63 or above, and 68.4% (n = 52) had moderate–severe hopelessness. Although there was no significant difference, the SA rate was higher in those who had experienced SA before running away. 'Intrafamilial relationship problems' and 'SA-related factors' were the most frequently reported reasons for runaway behavior. Victims of SA had significantly higher scores in all BSI subdimensions and global symptom severity than those previously not SA victims. The results suggest that high levels of psychological symptoms, hopelessness, history of SA, and poor parent–child relationships are possible factors that can describe female adolescents who have run away from home. Psychosocial prevention programs involving adolescents and parents are needed to prevent at-risk female adolescents from running away from home. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - There is increasing recognition and attention towards the patterns of police encounters with citizens. In this study, we examine the determinants of being stopped and questioned by the police among a heterogenous sample of adolescents and young adults, who were either people who use drugs and a comparison group, in three non-metropolitan areas of British Columbia, Canada. We conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses to identify the unique variation of frequent police encounters based on demographic characteristics and potential confounders. Of 448 young people, 92.0% reported at least one event where police stopped and questioned them in the past five years, and half (49.8%) reported frequent (four or more) police encounters in this time frame. The demographics of race, age, and gender were not significant in the analyses, whereas weekly illicit drug use, homelessness, and high visibility in the community were significantly related to frequent police encounters. Findings suggest that, controlling for demographic variables, young people who have precarious housing, use drugs, and have higher community visibility are at higher risk of police contact. Our findings also show when street involvement and drug use are controlled for, race does not determine police encounters. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Little is known about human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination uptake among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH), who may be at higher risk for HPV than their housed counterparts. We examined the prevalence and associations of HPV vaccination initiation and completion among YEH. Guided by the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, we analyzed cross-sectional data collected from YEH (N = 1074; ages 18-26) in seven U.S. cities to assess HPV vaccination prevalence and to identify predisposing, enabling, and need factors associated with HPV vaccination status. Due to timing differences in the release of HPV vaccine recommendations, we conducted separate logistic regression analyses for men (n = 673) and women (n = 401). Approximately 19% of men and 37% of women had initiated and completed HPV vaccination. Several factors among men (i.e., older age, Latinx ethnicity, San Jose or St. Louis residence compared with New York City, never having had sex, and not previously being tested for STIs) and women (i.e., lower education level, San Jose or Houston residence compared with New York City, and never having had sex) were associated with lower odds of HPV vaccination initiation, completion, or both. Gay men had higher odds of initiating and completing the vaccination series than their heterosexual counterparts. Our findings reveal that HPV vaccination uptake is low among YEH and that there are vaccination disparities among subgroups of YEH. HPV vaccination strategies and resources that are easy-to-understand, facilitate point-of-care services, and address societal and system-level vaccination barriers encountered by YEH are needed.

AB  - The study reported in this article assessed prevalence and demographic correlates of sex trafficking in a purposive sample of 270 young people experiencing homelessness in three U.S. cities (Philadelphia; Phoenix; and Washington, DC) and at five host agencies. Participants were 57% male, 38% female, 4% transgender, and 1% other. The average age of participants was 20.7 years (SD = 2.0 years). The majority of the participants were African American (56%), followed by white (14%) and multiracial (14%). The Human Trafficking Interview and Assessment Measure detected that nearly one in five young people were victims of sex trafficking, either due to force, fraud, or coercion (FFC); age; or both. Those who were sex trafficked were more likely than those who were not sex trafficked to be female, sexual minorities, or Latino and to have either dropped out of high school or obtained a GED. Differences between being trafficked due to FFC and being trafficked due to age were also investigated. Findings support the need for development of targeted prevention and intervention efforts for young people experiencing homelessness that address sex trafficking victimization and related risk factors.

AB  - Homeless young adults are more likely than their never-homeless counterparts to abuse substances and engage in sexual risk behaviors. This study evaluated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of OnTrack, a smartphone application to self-monitor substance use and sexual risk behaviors, plus a brief motivational intervention (BMI), in reducing substance use and sexual risk among homeless young adults. A randomized controlled pilot trial (N = 60) compared OnTrack + BMI to treatment as usual (TAU) at an inner-city crisis shelter for homeless young adults (aged 18-21 years). Participants were assessed at baseline and 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks after baseline to evaluate substance use and sexual risk behaviors. Kruskal-Wallis tests determined differences between baseline and postintervention assessments. Logistic regression models examined treatment effect on change in outcomes between baseline and postintervention follow-up assessment, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in OnTrack + BMI significantly reduced past 2-week number of drinks (p = .023), times used marijuana (p = .046), times engaged in unprotected sex (p = .012), and times used drugs before sexual activity (p = .019). No reductions of substance use or sexual risk behaviors were found among participants in TAU (all ps > .05). After adjusting for baseline levels of substance use and sexual risk, participants in OnTrack + BMI had significantly lower odds than those in TAU for drinking alcohol (adjusted OR = 0.14; p = .01) and having unprotected sex (adjusted OR = 0.151; p = .032). OnTrack + BMI is feasible and effective in reducing past 2-week alcohol use and unprotected sex among homeless young adults. A larger randomized trial is warranted to replicate and extend present results. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Extensive research suggests that transition-age youth (TAY) disproportionately experience periods in which they are either homeless or precariously housed. However, less is understood on the experiences of homelessness among female TAY who are parenting (TAY-M), a particularly vulnerable subgroup of TAY. In an effort to understand the characteristics and needs of TAY-M, this study conducted chi-squared tests to evaluate the differences between homeless and housed TAY-M on demographics, general functioning, and service use at age 21. Findings of this study emphasize the need for targeted interventions for TAY-M who experience homelessness. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background:Homeless young adults are more likely than their never-homeless counterparts to abuse alcohol and engage in risky sexual behaviors, yet no interventions to simultaneously reduce both these behaviors among this vulnerable population have been systematically designed and evaluated. We therefore developed a brief intervention (BI) to reduce both alcohol use and sexual risk behaviors among homeless young adults. The results of a randomized trial testing the BI against an education comparison (EC) are presented. Method:Young adults (N = 61; age 17–22 years) from an urban, Northeastern crisis shelter were randomly assigned to either the two-session, individual-level BI or a time-matched, two-session, individual-level EC. Generalized linear mixed models for repeated measures determined effects of treatment condition on outcomes. Results:The BI significantly increased participant readiness to change alcohol use. However, it did not significantly decrease primary alcohol or HIV sexual risk outcomes, independently or relative to EC (allps > 0.05). Participants in the EC reduced times engaged in unprotected sex between baseline and post-intervention to a significantly greater extent (p < 0.01) than those in the BI condition. Participants in both conditions reported satisfaction with respective interventions. Conclusions:Findings suggest that the BI was acceptable and successful in getting participants to consider changing their drinking. However, lack of change in alcohol and sexual behavior outcomes indicates the need for further research to determine how to translate readiness to change into actual behavioral change among homeless young adults.

AB  - Youths who experience homelessness are at high risk of victimization, yet little is known about school violence in the context of students experiencing homelessness. Specifically, limited research has considered different subgroups of students experiencing homelessness according to the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act (nonsheltered, sheltered, doubled up) in comparison with nonhomeless students. Using a representative sample ofCalifornia public high school students (N = 390,028), authors applied bivariate and multivariate analyses to examine differences among nonsheltered, sheltered, and doubled-up students experiencing homelessness regarding levels of discriminatory bullying, behavioral victimization, and weapon victimization at school. Findings show that students experiencing homelessness across all subgroups are at high risk of experiencing school violence. The severity of findings and differences among subgroups emphasize the need to develop school-based responses for each subgroup. Providers serving youths experiencing homelessness are encouraged to consider schools as a site for prevention and intervention for this population. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objectives: The current study sought to test hard drug use outcomes for youth receiving a strengths-based outreach and advocacy intervention that linked youth to either a shelter or a drop-in center. Methods: Homeless youth (14–24 years old) were engaged by research assistants (RAs) at soup kitchens, parks, libraries, and other locations that homeless youth were known to frequent. Youth were randomly assigned to receive six months of advocacy that focused on linking youth to a drop-in center (n = 40) or to a crisis shelter (n = 39). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Hard drug use over time was the main outcome. Intervention condition and service connection were used as predictors for the baseline level and the slope of change in hard drug use over time. Data analysis was conducted with Bernoulli Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling in HLM7. Results: The current study found that those who were in the drop-in linkage condition exhibited a greater reduction in their odds of using hard drugs during the follow-up points than their counterparts in the shelter linkage condition. And finally, those who utilized services more often during the follow-ups were those who exhibited less hard drug use at baseline and less reduction in their odds of using hard drugs. Conclusions: This study suggests that drop-in centers, which are often characterized by low-demand programming and few behavioral restrictions, are effective for addressing hard drug use among homeless youth.

AB  - Outreach and service linkage are key for engaging marginalized populations, such as homeless youth, in services. Research to date has focused primarily on engaging individuals already receiving some services through emergency shelters, clinics, or other programs. Less is known about those who are not connected to services and, thus, likely the most vulnerable and in need of assistance. The current study sought to engage non-service-connected homeless youth (N = 79) into a strengths-based outreach and advocacy intervention. Youth were randomly assigned to receive 6 months of advocacy that focused on linking youth to a drop-in center (n = 40) or to a crisis shelter (n = 39). All youth were assessed at baseline and 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Findings indicated that youth prefer drop-in center services to the shelter. Also, the drop-in center linkage condition was associated with more service linkage overall (B = 0.34, SE = 0.04, p < 0.01) and better alcohol-l [B = -0.39, SE = 0.09, t(75) = -4.48, p < 0.001] and HIV-related outcomes [B = 0.62, SE = 0.10, t(78) = 6.34, p < 0.001] compared to the shelter linkage condition. Findings highlight the importance of outreach and service linkage for reconnecting service-marginalized youth, and drop-in centers as a primary service option for homeless youth.

AB  - Homeless youth frequently experience victimization, and youth with histories of trauma often fail to detect danger risks, making them vulnerable to subsequent victimization. The current study describes a pilot test of a skills-based intervention designed to improve risk detection among homeless youth through focusing attention to internal, interpersonal, and environmental cues. Youth aged 18 to 21 years (N = 74) were recruited from a shelter and randomly assigned to receive usual case management services or usual services plus a 3-day manualized risk detection intervention. Pretest and posttest interviews assessed youths’ risk detection abilities through vignettes describing risky situations and asking youth to identify risk cues present. Separate 2 (intervention vs. control) × 2 (pretest vs. posttest) mixed ANOVAs found significant interaction effects, as intervention youth significantly improved in overall risk detection compared with control youth. Post hoc subgroup analyses found the intervention had a greater effect for youth without previous experiences of indirect victimization than those with previous indirect victimization experiences.

AB  - Most studies of condomless sex among homeless youth have focused on peer norms, while excluding other potentially pertinent influences. This study explored how different types of relationships contributed to norms about condomless sex and whether such norms were associated with engagement in condomless sex among homeless youth. Additionally, because recent work has noted gender differences in social networks of male and female homeless youth, gender differences in social network norms of condomless sex were also assessed. Egocentric network data were collected from homeless youth accessing services at two drop-in centers in Los Angeles, CA (N = 976). Multivariate analyses (non-stratified and stratified by gender) assessed associations between descriptive, injunctive, and communicative norms and participants' engagement in condomless sex. Multivariate analyses indicated that perception of peer condom use and communication with sexual partners were significantly associated with not engaging in condomless sex. These relationships, however, varied by gender. Implications for interventions are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Experiencing sexual victimization prior to becoming homeless is common among homeless youth and is associated with increased HIV risk behavior. This study examined mediating variables that underlie this association, adding to the understanding of gender differences in these paths. Participants were homeless youth in Los Angeles recruited through service access centers who completed a computerized self-administered interview in English or Spanish using an iPad. Findings indicate a high presence of sexual victimization across both genders. Female participants experienced posttraumatic stress disorder and subsequent engagement with exchange sex, whereas male participants were primarily involved in substance use risk pathways. Results indicate paths in the association between sexual victimization and HIV risk behavior differ between male and female homeless youth. Gender-specific, mental-health-informed interventions targeting sexual risk reduction are warranted. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - There is a need for positive youth development/strengths-based approaches to support the wellbeing and social inclusion of young people experiencing or at risk of homelessness. My Strengths Training for Life™ (MST4Life™) uses a strengths-based approach with the aim to improve young people's resilience, self-worth, wellbeing and engagement in education, employment, and training. This mixed methods study assessed the fidelity of delivery style of the MST4Life™ programme, the extent to which frontline service staff can delivery psychologically informed programmes to service users and identified barriers and enablers to delivering with fidelity to the intended style. Observations of programme delivery (two facilitators per session) took place across early, middle, and late phases of the programme across a pilot phase (n = 18) and main study (n = 45). Facilitators also completed self-reflection forms following each session. The mean observation score was 82.2 ± 15.7 %, and facilitator self-report mean adherence score was 89.3 ± 6.2 % which indicate that the programme was delivered with high fidelity. Quantitative data was also analysed using non-parametric statistical test (Mann-Whitney U Test). There was a significant difference between observation scores for deliverers with postgraduate psychology training compared to deliverers without postgraduate psychology training (p =. 029). Qualitative data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Barriers and enablers included communication, frontline staff support, logistics, and participant behaviours. Overall, this study highlights that despite the challenges of delivering complex community programmes to young people experiencing homelessness, it was possible for frontline service staff to deliver MST4Life™ with high fidelity. • Mixed methods study that explored adherence to delivery style when delivering a psychologically informed programme. • Examples that can be used in implementing programmes to ensure the context is strengths-based and psychologically informed. • Mean observation score and mean facilitator self-report score indicated the programme was delivered with high fidelity. • Fidelity to delivery style was impacted by communication, support from frontline staff, logistics and participant behaviour. • Frontline service staff are able to implement a mental skills training programme for young experiencing homelessness.

AB  - Inadequate housing and homelessness among families represent a substantial challenge for child and adolescent well-being. Child welfare services confront housing that threatens placement into foster care with little resources and evidence to guide practice. The present study provides the first rigorous test of the Family Unification Program (FUP) – a federal program that offers housing subsidies for inadequately housed families under investigation for child maltreatment. A randomized controlled trial assesses program impact on foster care placement and costs. The experiment referred intact child welfare-involved families whose inadequate housing threatened foster placement in Chicago, IL to FUP plus housing advocacy ( n  = 89 families with 257 children) or housing advocacy alone ( n  = 89 families with 257 children). Families were referred from 2011 to 2013, and administrative data recorded dates and costs of foster placements over a 3-year follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses suggested families randomly assigned for FUP exhibited slower increases in rates of foster placement following housing intervention compared with families referred for housing advocacy alone. The program generates average savings of nearly $500 per family per year to the foster care system. Housing subsidies provide the foster care system small but significant benefits for keeping homeless families together. Findings inform the design of a coordinated child welfare response to housing insecurity. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study aimed to identify homeless youths’ lifestyle and trauma-related risk factors as well as protective factors associated with alcohol use disorder or no disorder and drug use disorder or no disorder. Youth receiving homeless services in Denver (n= 201), Austin (n= 200), and Los Angeles (n= 200;N= 601) completed quantitative interviews assessing demographic information, alcohol and drug use, homeless lifestyle risk factors, trauma-related risk factors, and protective factors. Findings showed differences in trauma-related risk factors between alcohol and drug use disorders, but not homeless lifestyle risks. Protective factors predicted substance use disorders beyond risk factors. Understanding trauma-related risk and protective factors associated with substance use disorders could improve interventions.

AB  - As taught to youth, mindfulness is simply paying attention, with kindness and curiosity, to what's happening inside and outside of oneself, in this present moment. A quickly growing research base is demonstrating treatment feasibility and acceptability, and a range of emotional, meta-cognitive, and behavioral benefits with various populations of youth. Only a few studies have explored mindfulness with middle school students, and no studies have evaluated mindfulness training with youth facing homelessness. Our purpose was to evaluate the acceptability, generalizability, and overall effectiveness of an 8-week mindfulness course for traditional middle school students and middle school students facing homelessness. A quasi-experimental design included two treatment groups and a non-equivalent comparison group: (1) students in traditional classrooms (n = 28), (2) those attending a school serving homeless youth (n = 15), and (3) waitlisted students (n = 20). We reviewed student reported changes from pre- to post-test and post-course evaluations, which included open-ended writing about mindfulness practice. Students in traditional classrooms improved significantly in mindful awareness and acceptance, whereas students facing homelessness reported significantly higher evaluations of the course, greater emotional well-being from mindfulness practice, and were more likely to use mindfulness practice at school, in interpersonal situations, for dealing with anger and other difficult emotions, and to recommend it to friends. There were no significant findings in some outcome measures. The study offers optimistic prospects for further evaluations with adolescents in domains of stress, anger, quality of life, and academic behavioral indices over time, and to assess the effectiveness of teacher trainings for mindfulness instructors.

AB  - Homeless young adults ages 18-25 exhibit high rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use, and sexual risk behaviors such as unprotected sex. Yet few programs exist for this population that are both effective and can be easily incorporated into settings serving this population. This pilot cluster cross-over randomized controlled trial evaluates AWARE, a voluntary four session group-based motivational interviewing (MI) intervention to reduce AOD use and sexual risk behavior. We evaluated AWARE with 200 homeless young adults using drop-in center services in Los Angeles County (mean age=21.8years; 73% male; 79% heterosexual; 31% non-Hispanic White, 25% African American, 24% Hispanic, 21% multiracial/other). Surveys were completed at baseline and three months after program completion. Retention in the AWARE program was excellent (79% attended multiple sessions) and participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the program. AWARE participants self-reported positive change in their past 3month and past 30day alcohol use (ps≤0.05), motivation to change drug use (ps<0.05), and condom use self-efficacy (p=0.05) compared to the control group. Among those with multiple sex partners, AWARE participants showed a decrease in unprotected sexual events (p<0.05), whereas the control group did not. Results from this pilot evaluation are promising, suggesting that a brief group-MI risk reduction intervention can be effective in helping homeless young adults make positive changes in their alcohol and condom use. Further work is needed to more fully evaluate the efficacy of AWARE on AOD behavior and sexual risk behavior outcomes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Providing stable housing for runaway and homeless youth is a major function of a transitional living program. This article introduces the focus of one program working with LGBTQ youth in New York City and discusses some issues to consider when working with this population. The article also presents data associated with young people's lives after discharge. In any discussion of outcomes, both reason for discharge and length of stay play important roles in whether or not an exit is safe. Regardless of these two elements, the places youth move to when leaving programs are crucial to their safety and well-being. The exit can be safe even when a young person is discharged early from a program. This article presents types of exits, as well as status of employment and school enrollment at exit. Some youth and staff-identified lessons gained in the program also are discussed in detail. Types of aftercare services sought by discharged youth are specified. This article also describes any differences in outcomes for youth with and without foster care experience. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Few resilience enhancement interventions are available to help homeless youth at high risk for mental health problems and substance abuse. Mindfulness meditation has demonstrated effectiveness in persons who deal with some of these issues. Our purpose was to examine the feasibility of delivering a spirituality development class-a minimally modified version of Yale University's 8-session Spiritual Self-Schema (3-S) program-to homeless youth in a shelter in an urban center in the Southeastern United States. We used a quasi-experimental, one group, pre- and post-intervention design with standardized self-report measures of impulsiveness, resilience, spirituality, mental wellness, and psychological symptoms. Seventy-one youth enrolled in the study; 39 of the youth attended at least four sessions of the class and completed the posttest. The spirituality development class was well received by the youth and, overall, participants demonstrated improvement on measures of spirituality, mental wellness, psychological symptoms, and resilience on the posttest. There were no statistically meaningful changes in impulsiveness scores. We concluded that mindfulness meditation programs are feasible for this population. Future studies of high-risk youth should use a randomized controlled trial design to examine the long-term impact of such training on psychological status and behavioral outcomes such as educational path, work attainment, and drug and alcohol abuse.

AB  - Community-based youth shelters represent the primary method of intervention for runaway youths and are mandated to reunify youths with their families. The study discussed in this article pursued two research questions: (I) What are the differences among runaway--homeless, throwaway, and independent youths? (2) What youth demographics, personal characteristics, and family factors predict youth's reunification? The Runaway Homeless Youth Management Information System (RHYMIS), a comprehensive, automated information system developed to assist federally funded youth shelters nationwide, was used. The final sample included 17,790 youths using shelter services during 1997. Chi-square and logistic regression demonstrated that the three groups differed significantly on a variety of characteristics. Among runaway--homeless youths, family characteristics were most important for youths' reunification; among throwaway youths, problem behaviors predicted not returning home, and among independent youths, only individual demographics predicted reunification.

AB  - The goal of the current study was to identify potential individual and environmental protective factors for sex risk behavior among homeless youth. We explored gender differences in the prediction of unprotected sex and number of sex partners. Data were collected from 192 sexually active, homeless youth who were 14–21 years old. High rates of sex risk behavior were reported. Significant gender differences were found in STD rates with 19% of females and 2% of males reporting an STD diagnosis during the previous three months. Findings indicated that positive expectations for the future were associated with fewer sex partners for both genders, whereas decision making skills predicted a lower percentage of unprotected sex for males and fewer sex partners for females. For females, univariate analyses indicated that self-esteem and having a natural mentor may reduce the likelihood of unprotected sex, whereas multivariate analysis indicated that being employed or in school may play a protective role with respect to number of sex partners.

AB  - The rationale and design for a brief feedback and motivational intervention for substance use among homeless adolescents is described. Homeless adolescents use substances at extremely high rates compared to other youth, and experience considerable negative consequences as a result. Yet homeless adolescents are not reached by, or are not responsive to, traditional prevention and treatment programs for substance use and abuse. The rationale for the use of brief feedback interventions is reviewed, and one such program that was designed to reduce substance use risk among homeless youth is described. The intervention is consistent with tenants of harm reduction in its effort to encourage engagement via its structure, minimal demands, and flexible clinical strategies and goals. Modifications made to the intervention based on lessons learned from an initial trial are described, and highlight the importance of tailoring harm reduction programs to facilitate engagement based on clients' life circumstances, availability, and motivation.

AB  - This article reports on results of a one-day public health survey conducted in six states by homeless youth providers to measure and compare risk factors between lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) homeless youth and non-LGB homeless youth. This article intends to inform the child welfare field on existing gaps in services and areas where more training and technical support is necessary in providing services to homeless LGB youth. The findings point to substantial differences within the homeless youth sample and demonstrate that in addition to the public health risks young people face merely by being homeless, the risks are exacerbated for those who self-identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. The article informs child welfare providers and policymakers about the substantial vulnerability of LGB youth beyond that of non-LGB homeless youth and the need to fund programming, training, technical assistance and further research to specifically respond to the complex needs of this population.

AB  - This paper considers ethnographic investigation 'at home' in reference, in part, to research carried out into youth homelessness in Britain. Relations of distance and familiarity in the field, and the notion of the ethnographer as stranger, are discussed so as to advance an understanding of the purpose and practice of participant observation. The paper explores fieldwork relations in the context of urban and social exploration, and also with reference to ethnographic research with young people and/or children. In conclusion, the paper argues for a recognition of difference and distance in fieldwork, not simply as obstacles to be somehow overcome but as something inevitable and necessary to the insights that fieldwork affords.

AB  - Poly-victimization is common among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) and youth in substance use treatment. To date, studies have not examined poly-victimization among these two intersecting populations. To examine heterogeneity in lifetime victimization experiences among youth reporting homelessness at substance use treatment entry; identify demographic predictors of victimization class membership; and associations between victimization and clinical characteristics at treatment intake. 1270 adolescents and young adults reporting past 90-day homelessness in a nationwide substance use treatment data set. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) and logistic regression were used to examine heterogeneity in poly-victimization experiences, and associations with demographics and clinical characteristics for males and females. Four victimization classes emerged for males, and five victimization classes emerged for females. The prevalence of victimization and trauma characteristics were higher for females, except physical victimization, which was higher for males. Age, race/ethnicity, and sexual minority status were related to poly-victimization class membership, but not consistently across classes. Compared to low or single victimization classes, youth in the poly-victimization class had higher odds of post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, and exchange sex (among females); Poly-victimization class membership was not associated with duration of recent homelessness or substance use disorder diagnoses, when compared to low/less complex victimization. High rates of lifetime victimization were found for YEH in substance use treatment, with rates generally higher among females. Trauma-informed interventions are needed to address complex victimization experiences and poor mental health among unstably housed youth in treatment. • Four victimization classes were identified for males, and five for females. • Prevalence of victimization types was generally higher for females. • Poly-victimization was related to mental health diagnoses at treatment intake. • Poly-victimization was not consistently related to substance use disorder diagnoses.

AB  - The high rates of substance use among American adolescents are challenging; however, runaway youth are at particularly high-risk for substance use. Runaway youth utilizing two service sectors, emergency crisis shelters and juvenile detention centers, were recruited to evaluate differences in risk factors associated with substance use. Findings demonstrate that youth admitted to juvenile detention (n = 121) had proportionally higher levels of problem behaviors, including substance use, than youth admitted to shelter services (n = 156). Both groups of youth have significantly higher levels of substance use than national estimates. The most significant risk factor for alcohol and marijuana use among youth in both groups was using other substances. Addressing issues of substance abuse among runaway youth must be a prime objective for future research and treatment for this high-risk population. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article links the development of service user involvement championed in the United Kingdom to two examples in Dutch-speaking qualifying social work programmes: one from Belgium and one from the Netherlands. In both projects, a longer lasting cooperation with more marginalised service users was established. The Belgium project highlights social work lecturers and service users living in poverty, working in tandem to deliver a module to social work and socio-educational care work students. The example from the Netherlands involves young people from a homeless shelter as peer-researchers, working together with social work students. Both projects, one focusing on social work education and on social work research, highlight striking similarities in the positives and challenges of working with service users including how this challenges both groups preconceptions of the other, deepens learning but also creates greater potential for confrontations which need to be managed creatively. The article also identifies the pre-requisites for this to be effective including appropriate resourcing, training, facilitative skills and acknowledges that collaborations can be extremely fragile. However, such projects need further investment, experimentation and implementation on an international scale to share learning and promote creative approaches for the development and learning of social work students.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Addiction severity has been associated with numerous social- and health-related harms. This study sought to examine the prevalence and correlates of high-intensity drug use among street-involved youth in a Canadian setting with a focus on high-risk drug use practices and health service access. Methods: Data were derived from the At-Risk Youth Study, a Vancouver-based prospective cohort of street-involved youth aged 14–26. We used generalized estimating equations to examine variables associated with high-intensity drug use, defined as daily use of crack cocaine, cocaine, heroin, or crystal methamphetamine. Results: From September 2005 to November 2012, of 1017 youth included in the analyses, 529 (52%) reported high-intensity drug use as defined above at least once during the study period. In a multivariate analysis, older age (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.47); residing in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver (AOR = 1.46); homelessness (AOR = 1.30); recent incarceration (AOR = 1.25); inability to access addiction treatment (AOR = 1.42); and crack pipe sharing and/or used syringe injecting (AOR = 2.64), were all positively and independently associated with high-intensity drug use (p < 0.05). The most common barrier to accessing addiction treatment reported by these youth was long waiting lists. Conclusions: High-intensity drug use among street-involved youth was prevalent and associated with structural and geographical disadvantages in addition to high-risk drug administration practices. Youth reporting more frequent drug use also reported barriers to accessing addiction treatment, highlighting the need to expand addiction services tailored to youth at greatest risk of harm from illicit drug use and street-involvement.

AB  - Adolescence is a developmental period during which many youth experiment with risk practices. This paper examined the association of parental monitoring with a range of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use behaviors among high-risk youth, while controlling for other demographic and environmental variables previously found to be associated with AOD use. Participants were recruited as part of a longitudinal evaluation study of four youth drop-in centers located in Southern California. These centers served at-risk youth, including Hispanic, Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Questioning (LGBQ), and homeless and runaway youth. Participants were aged 14 to 24 and were new attendees at the drop-in centers. Results from logistic regression analyses revealed that while controlling for demographic and environmental variables, adolescents who reported less parental monitoring were more likely to report lifetime use of cigarettes, marijuana, and methamphetamine, and in the past three months, use of alcohol and binge drinking. The findings thus indicate that, even among high-risk youth, those who reported low parental monitoring were significantly more likely to use a variety of substances. Implications of these findings are discussed as they pertain to AOD prevention and interventions for children and their families. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Associations between self-esteem and abuse of alcohol and psychoactive substances have been documented in empirical studies involving high school and college students. No research exists that addresses whether this association generalizes to adult homeless substance users. The current study uses secondary data analysis methodology to evaluate an experimental design study involving 305 homeless men, assigned randomly to the treatment or control group. Control subjects were referred to community-based services. Experimental subjects were exposed to individual and group interventions, life-skills, and relapse prevention training while residing in a 24-hour shelter, for three months. Trained graduate students collected data using standardized questions to interview subjects. Three hypotheses were tested. Hypothesis I that the interventions would contribute toward increased self-esteem at T2, T3, T4 and T5 was not supported. The preponderance of findings pertaining to Hypothesis II, that higher self-esteem would be associated with lower alcohol and drug use in treatment subjects, and Hypothesis III, that these associations would be greater among treatment than control subjects over time, were not confirmed, although a few results were consistent with these hypotheses. Overall, results indicated that self-esteem was not increased in treatment subjects despite decreases in alcohol and drug use. The role of self-esteem in this population appears different from its importance in high school and college students. Possible reasons for this apparent difference are explored.

AB  - Especially in the media, young homeless people are frequently presented as posing a violent threat to other members of the public. However, the economic circumstances, living situation and age of homeless youth are consistent with factors identified in victim research with vulnerability to violent crime. The present research explored the nature and extent of violent victimisation of homeless young people after they had left home. Intensive interviews were conducted with 51 homeless youth who were under the age of 18. Almost two-thirds of these young people had been physically assaulted and half had been sexually assaulted in the previous 12 months. The perpetrators of this violence were predominantly male. There were major differences in the nature of the violent experiences of the young men and the young women in terms of the relationship to the perpetrator, the location of the assault and the motivation. The demand for sex was a factor throughout the experiences of the young women. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Research has substantiated that homeless and runaway youth are at high risk for offending and deviant behavior. Although gender, abuse, and deviant peers have been implicated in arrests among homeless youth, we know less about whether these precursors operate similarly for police harassment as well as for postrunaway arrest. In a study of 361 Midwestern homeless and runaway youth, several differences were noted between the predictors of arrest and police harassment. First, path-analytic techniques demonstrated that having deviant friends promoted harassment but not arrest. Second, substance use was the impetus for police harassment, whereas age at first runaway was consequential for arrest. Third, physically abused youth encountered more harassment, yet minor delinquent behavior increased the risk of arrest. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Introduction and Aims. Gender differences have been reported in adult substance users, but little research has examined gender differences in adolescents presenting to treatment services. This study aimed to explore gender differences in adolescents presenting to a withdrawal service. Design and Methods. All presentations to a withdrawal service between March 2000 and September 2004 were identified. For each presentation, the following information was extracted from clinical databases: sociodemographics, drug use, risk-taking behaviour, mental health symptoms, reasons and context of drug use. Significant gender differences identified at bivariate analysis were then incorporated into multivariate models exploring predictors of heroin use, cannabis use and sharing injecting equipment. Results. A total of 262 young people were admitted during the study period (53% male, mean age 16.8 years; SD 1.13). Bivariate analysis indicated that girls were more likely to report: being homeless, using a greater number of substances, using heroin and amphetamines, higher rates of injecting, sharing injecting equipment and using with a partner. Multivariate analysis identified that being female was an independent predictor of heroin use and that being male was an independent predictor of cannabis use. Significant predictors of sharing injecting equipment were using with a partner and current use of heroin; the effect of gender was not significant after controlling for other factors. Discussion and Conclusions.Our findings indicate that male and female adolescents presenting to a withdrawal treatment service exhibit differences in substance use characteristics. Future research should examine the role of gender in determining optimal treatment approaches in substance-using adolescents.[Dean AJ, McBride M, Macdonald EM, Connolly Y, McDermott BM.

AB  - This article uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 to examine the relationship between running away from home between the ages of 12 and 14 and dropping from high school among youth. Propensity score matching was conducted in estimating the effect of running away on high school dropout while controlling for confounding factors, such as familial instability and socioemotional health risks. The findings suggest that having runaway-homeless episodes have a detrimental effect on academic achievement. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study was to assess item characteristics indicative of the severity of risk for commercial sexual exploitation among a high-risk population of child welfare system involved youth to inform the construction of a screening tool. Existing studies have discerned factors that differentiate Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) victims from sexual abuse victims, yet no research has been conducted to discriminate which items in a high risk population of youth are most predictive of CSEC. Using the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW) cohorts I and II, we examined responses from 1063 males and 1355 females ages 11 and older, over three interview periods. A 2-parameter logistic Item Response Theory (2 PL IRT) model was employed in order to examine item performance as potential indicators for the severity of risk for CSEC. Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis was conducted in order to examine potential differences in item responses based on gender. Modeling strategies to assess item difficulty and discrimination were outlined and Item Characteristic Curves for the final retained items were presented. Evidence for uniform DIF were present within items that asked about runaway, any drug use, suicidality, and experiencing severe violence. Results from this study can inform the construction of a screening instrument to assess the severity of risk for experiencing CSEC. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Runaway youths represent a neglected clinical group, and few studies have examined ethnicity differences within this population. Substance use, family functioning and related problem behaviors were examined in a sample of Hispanic and Anglo runaway youths with substance abuse diagnoses (N = 145). Youths, aged 12-17, were recruited from two urban, southwestern runaway shelters. Within single-parent families, Anglo youths reported more marijuana use, and, regardless of family constitution, reported more tobacco use than did Hispanic youths. Overall, Anglo youths reported more externalizing problems and more conflict tactics used in resolving disagreements with their primary caretaker while Hispanic youths reported higher depression and familism scores. Given the differences found between Hispanic and Anglo youths, the findings argue that culturally sensitive interventions for runaway youths and families are warranted. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - While research on homeless adolescents and young adults evidencing substance use disorder is increasing, there is a dearth of information regarding effective interventions, and more research is needed to guide those who serve this population. The current study builds upon prior research showing promising findings of the community reinforcement approach (CRA) (Slesnick, Prestopnik, Meyers, & Glassman, 2007). Homeless adolescents and young adults between the ages of 14 to 20 years were randomized to one of three theoretically distinct interventions: (1) CRA ( n = 93), (2) motivational enhancement therapy (MET, n = 86), or (3) case management (CM, n = 91). The relative effectiveness of these interventions was evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months post-baseline. Findings indicated that substance use and associated problems were significantly reduced in all three interventions across time. Several moderating effects were found, especially for sex and history of childhood abuse. Findings show little evidence of superiority or inferiority of the three interventions and suggest that drop-in centers have choices for addressing the range of problems that these adolescents and young adults face.

AB  - Objective: Almost all of what is known about the families of runaways and homeless adolescents is based on adolescent self-reports. The validity of such research is currently being questioned by policy makers. The purpose of this study was to compare runaway and homeless adolescent reports and parent/caretaker reports on measures of parenting, family violence, and adolescent conduct. Method: Reports of 120 runaway adolescents and their parents/caretakers from four Midwestern states were compared on measures of parental monitoring, parental warmth and supportiveness, parental rejection, physical and sexual abuse, and adolescent conduct. Comparison groups of nonrunaway adolescents and their mothers in two-parent and single-parent families from the same geographical area were also used for parenting and adolescent conduct measures. Results: The findings indicated that although there were significant differences in means between adults and adolescents regardless of runaway status, adults and adolescent reports were in the same direction and present similar portraits of families of runaway and homeless young people. Both the parents/caretakers and their runaway adolescents reported lower levels of parental monitoring and warmth and supportiveness and higher levels of parental rejection than comparison groups of nonrunaway families. Parents/caretakers and runaway adolescents reported high levels of family violence and sexual abuse. Similarly, they concur regarding conduct problems for the adolescents. Conclusions: The findings suggest that runaway and homeless adolescents accurately depict the troubled family situations that they choose to leave. The policy implications for recent debates involving criminalization and mandatory return to parental custody of homeless and runaway youth are discussed. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Objetivo: Casi todo lo que se sabe de las familias de los adolescentes que se fugan y los que no tienen hogar est basado en auto-reportes de los mismos adolescentes. En la actualidad se est cuestionando la validez de este sistema de investigacin. El propsito de este estudio era comparar los reportes de los adolescentes que se fugan y los sin hogar con los reportes de los padres/tutores en cuanto a medidas de crianza, violencia familiar y conducta del adolescente. Mtodo: Se compararon los reportes de 120 adolescentes que se fugaron y los de sus padres/tutores de cuatro estados del medio-oeste en las medidas de monitoreo parental, calidez parental y apoyo, rechazo parental, abuso fsico y sexual, y conducta adolescente. Se utilizaron tambin grupos de control de adolescentes que no se haban fugado y sus madres en familias con ambos padres y en familias mono-parentales de la misma rea geogrfica para obtener datos sobre la crianza y la conducta adolescente. Resultados: Los hallazgos indican que a pesar de que se encontraron diferencias significativas en las medias entre los adultos y los adolescentes sin importar su status de fuga, los reportes de los adultos y los adolescentes tenan la misma direccin y presentaban cuadros similares de las familias de los que se fugaron y los jvenes sin hogar. Tanto los padres/tutores como sus adolescentes que se haban fugado reportaron altos niveles de violencia familiar y abuso sexual. As tambin, estaban de acuerdo en cuanto a los problemas de conducta de los adolescentes. Conclusiones: Los resultados sugieren que los adolescentes que se fugan y los que no tienen hogar presentan con exactitud las situaciones problematizadas de la familia que deciden abandonar. Se discuten las implicaciones polticas relacionadas con debates recientes sobre la criminalizacin y la obligatoriedad de volver a la custodia parental de los jvenes que se fugan y no tienen hogar.

Rsultats: Les donnes indiquent que malgr des diffrences significatives entre adultes et adolescents, indpendamment du statut de fugueur, les donnes des adultes et des adolescents allaient dans la mme direction et prsentaient des portraits similaires des familles de jeunes fugueurs et sans domicile fixe. Aussi bien les parents/responsables que leurs adolescents fugueurs mentionnaient moins de capacits parentales, moins de chaleur et de soutien et plus de rejet en comparaison avec les groupes de famille de non-gugueurs. Les parents/responsables et les adolescents fugueurs mentionnaient beaucoup de violence familiale et d'abus sexuel. On retrouve les mmes similitudes pour les troubles du comportement des adolescents. Conclusions: Les donnes suggrent que les adolescents fugueurs et sand domicile dcrivent avec beaucoup de fiabilit leur situation familiale qu'ils dcident de quitter. Les implications...

AB  - A sample of 223 adolescents who sought services from runaway and homeless youth programs in New York State during 1986-1987 was identified as having a history of maltreatment. A demographic profile is presented and the nature of their maltreatment described. The majority of these youth were female and between 15-16 years of age. Less than 25% came from intact families and one-third were born to single mothers. Of the sample, 60% had allegedly experienced physical abuse, 42% emotional abuse, 48% neglect, and 21% sexual abuse. Over one-third were "pushed out" of their homes by their families. Biological mothers were the most frequently cited perpetrators of maltreatment (63%), followed by biological fathers (45%). The sample of maltreated runaways is compared to both statewide and national samples of runaway and homeless youth with regard to their demographic characteristics and the problems they present to staff at intake (e.g., depression, substance abuse, etc.). Youth in the maltreated sample were more likely to be female and were more likely to have engaged in suicidal behavior. Otherwise, the maltreated runaways were not readily distinguished from the runaway and homeless youth population at large. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The comparative salience of attitudes, normative influences, and perceptions of the ease or difficulty of engaging in marijuana use was examined in 91 adolescents from three subsamples: those living in Nimbin, Australia, where marijuana use appears to have become normalized, a control group, and a group of homeless adolescents, surveyed in 1997. There were no differences between two of the groups in relation to their attitudes towards marijuana, and no differences in perceived access to the drug. For those who intended using marijuana, personal beliefs were significantly more salient than beliefs about what important others thought they should do. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

No hubo diferencias entre dos de los grupos en relación a su actitud hacia la mariguana, ni tampoco se encontraron diferencias en su forma de percibir su acceso a la droga. Para aquellos que decidieron involucrarse con la mariguana, se encontró que sus convicciones personales fueron significativamente más importantes que las opiniones que otros pudieran tener sobre lo que estos adolescentes deberían hacer.

Il n’y avaient pas de différences entre deux de ces groupes par rapport à leurs attitudes envers la marijuana ni de différences dans leur perception quand à l’accès à la drogue.

AB  - Case management, a widely practiced form of service brokerage, is associated with a variety of positive outcomes for homeless youth, but it may be difficult to implement, as youth face logistical barriers to attending in-person meetings. As part of a larger clinical trial, the current study investigates the feasibility of providing electronic case management (ECM) to homeless youth, using cell-phones, texts, email, and Facebook. Youth were given prepaid cell-phones and a case manager who provided four ECM sessions every 2–3 weeks over a 3-month period. Contact logs were used to record how many youth engaged in ECM, how many attempts were necessary to elicit engagement, and youths’ preferred technology methods for engaging. Although engagement in the number of ECM sessions varied, the majority of youth (87.5%) engaged in at least one ECM session. Youth (41%) most commonly needed one contact before they engaged in an ECM session, and the majority responded by the third attempt. While youth most commonly answered calls directly, their chosen method of returning calls was texting. The majority of youth (80%) described ECM positively, reporting themes of convenience, connection, and accountability. The use of ECM, particularly of texting, offers promising implications for providing services to homeless youth. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article reports on results of a one-day public health survey conducted in six states by homeless youth providers to measure and compare risk factors between lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) homeless youth and non-LGB homeless youth. This article intends to inform the child welfare field on existing gaps in services and areas where more training and technical support is necessary in providing services to homeless LGB youth. The findings point to substantial differences within the homeless youth sample and demonstrate that in addition to the public health risks young people face merely by being homeless, the risks are exacerbated for those who self-identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. The article informs child welfare providers and policymakers about the substantial vulnerability of LGB youth beyond that of non-LGB homeless youth and the need to fund programming, training, technical assistance and further research to specifically respond to the complex needs of this population.

AB  - Chronically homeless individuals with alcohol dependence experience severe alcohol-related consequences. It is therefore important to identify factors that might be associated with reduced alcohol-related harm, such as the use of safer-drinking strategies. Whereas effectiveness of safer-drinking strategies has been well-documented among young adults, no studies have explored this topic among more severely affected populations, such as chronically homeless individuals with alcohol dependence. The aims of this study were thus to qualitatively and quantitatively document safer-drinking strategies used in this population. Participants ( N = 31) were currently or formerly chronically homeless individuals with alcohol dependence participating in a pilot study of extended-release naltrexone and harm-reduction counseling. At weeks 0 and 8, research staff provided a list of safer-drinking strategies for participants to endorse. Implementation of endorsed safer-drinking strategies was recorded at the next appointment. At both time points, strategies to buffer the effects of alcohol on the body (e.g., eating prior to and during drinking) were most highly endorsed, followed by changing the manner in which one drinks (e.g., spacing drinks), and reducing alcohol consumption. Quantitative analyses indicated that all participants endorsed safer-drinking strategies, and nearly all strategies were implemented (80–90% at weeks 0 and 8, respectively). These preliminary findings indicate that chronically homeless people with alcohol dependence use strategies to reduce harm associated with their drinking. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to test whether interventions that teach safer-drinking strategies may reduce overall alcohol-related harm in this population. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Providing stable housing for runaway and homeless youth is a major function of a transitional living program. This article introduces the focus of one program working with LGBTQ youth in New York City and discusses some issues to consider when working with this population. The article also presents data associated with young people's lives after discharge. In any discussion of outcomes, both reason for discharge and length of stay play important roles in whether or not an exit is safe. Regardless of these two elements, the places youth move to when leaving programs are crucial to their safety and well-being. The exit can be safe even when a young person is discharged early from a program. This article presents types of exits, as well as status of employment and school enrollment at exit. Some youth and staff-identified lessons gained in the program also are discussed in detail. Types of aftercare services sought by discharged youth are specified. This article also describes any differences in outcomes for youth with and without foster care experience. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Utilizing a sample of 300 homeless street youths, the research examines the individual-level sub-model of Baumer's interpretation of Merton's anomie theory. The paper explores the role the interaction between monetary goals and weak commitment to legitimate means plays in the generation of instrumental crime and the manner in which this interaction is itself moderated by blocked opportunities, monetary dissatisfaction, social modeling, cultural support, and the perceived risk of punishment. The findings reveal that a weak commitment to legitimate means, but not monetary goals, has a lower order impact on the willingness to commit instrumental crime. These two variables, however, do not interact to predict intentions to offend. Instead the findings reveal that blocked opportunities and higher levels of monetary dissatisfaction moderate the relationship between the monetary goals and weak commitment to legitimate means interaction and the willingness to offend. Findings are discussed and suggestions for further research are offered. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The article presents a comparative research on the teenage AIDS patients in San Diego and Los Angeles. It reflects the rates and associated factors among the homeless and runaway adolescents in these cities San Diego and Los Angeles regarding the HIV risk behavior and HIV testing. The article informs that the study examined differences in self-reported rates and predictors of HIV testing between homeless and runaway youths in San Diego and Los Angeles numbering 1,102 and 1,167 respectively. Using a stratified sampling design the youths aged 13-23 were recruited from agencies and street sites. It highlights that the goals of HIV testing and counseling include drawing individuals at risk for HIV in for pretest counseling, testing and post-test counseling. It views that the researchers administered a structured survey instrument lasting 20 minutes, which assessed youths' involvement in HIV risk-related sexual and drug-use behaviors, contact with outreach workers and other variables. Around 78 percent of the youths in Los Angeles were reported, where as in San Diego the percentage was 52 percent.

AB  - This article systematically reviews studies exploring resilience among youth experiencing homelessness. We searched eight databases, and 21 articles fit the inclusion criteria and represented four methodologies: qualitative (n = 7, 33.3%), survey and secondary data analysis (n = 8, 38.1%), quantitative (n = 4, 19.1%), and mixed-method (n = 2, 9.5%) designs. Studies indicate that youth experiencing homelessness rely on informal social networks for survival, and that spirituality, mental health, and creativity are associated with enhanced coping. More experimental and intervention studies are necessary to support evidence-based resilience practices. Additionally, researchers need to exercise more self-awareness about how stereotypical pejorative paradigms may constrain innovative, strengths-based scholarship. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Using secondary analyses of data from a sample of 265 sexual minority youths, the authors examined correlates of cutting behavior to determine whether patterns are similar to those found in studies of self-injury with community samples of predominately heterosexual youths. The sample consisted of youths who received services at an urban social service agency serving the sexual minority community; youths from the region attending social events, who located the survey through the Internet, or who were referred from other youth-serving agencies; and youths from out of state who found the survey through the Internet or were referred by youth-serving agencies. Prevalence of cutting was higher than that found in community-based samples of similar age groups. However, similar patterns of risk were found with regard to peer victimization, homelessness, suicidality, and depression. Female and transgender respondents were more likely to have engaged in cutting behavior than were male respondents. No significant race-based differences emerged. Both age and having knowledge of a supportive adult were associated with decreased likelihood of cutting. Additional findings link higher levels of "outness," higher occurrence of suicidality among social network, and higher rates of smoking to increased likelihood of cutting. Implications for practice and future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study explored the gender differences in sexual self-concept, personal resources for sexual health, safe sex behaviors, and risky sexual behaviors among homeless adolescents with and without histories of sexual abuse. Data for this secondary analysis were collected in 2003 to 2004 in the first phase of a larger repeated-measures sexual health intervention study; 371 homeless youth between 16 and 23 years of age (M = 19.26, SD = 1.83) were recruited from a street outreach center. The majority (64.6%) of participants were males. Self-report instruments were completed at the outreach center via audio computer-assisted self-interview (A-CASI) format. It was found that female participants were better off than males on numerous measures of sexual health behaviors and attitudes. Sexually abused participants had significantly less future time perspective (p = .05), fewer sexual self-care behaviors (p = .04), and less social support than nonabused participants (p = .01) and almost significantly more sexual risk-taking (p = .08). However, no significant differences were found between abused and nonabused participants on sexual self-concept, self-efficacy or intention to use condoms, safe sex behaviors, AIDS knowledge, assertive communication, or self-efficacy to perform testicular/breast self-exams. Overall, participants who did not report a history of sexual abuse had significantly more sexual health resources and engaged in fewer sex-risk behaviors than those who reported having been abused. These differences have notable implications for screening adolescents for a history of sexual abuse. Adolescents who report sexual abuse should receive risk counseling and be screened regularly for the development of sexual risk behaviors. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objective: To assess HIV-related drug and sex risk behaviors and evaluate factors associated with change in risk behaviors among runaway and homeless adolescents, 244 street youth were recruited from a community drop-in center serving high-risk youth. Method: Using a cross-sectional design, approximately half of study participants received training in a peer-based intervention that included principles derived from the health belief model, while the remaining subjects received no intervention. Subjects were interviewed at baseline, immediately following the intervention (for those receiving the training) and 3 months later. Logistic regression and analysis of covariance were used to analyze intervention effects. Results: Compared to youth in the control condition, runaways receiving the intervention significantly increased their knowledge about HIV. Contrary to the health belief model, in multivariate analyses knowledge and greater perceived chance for HIV were associated with high risk behavior. On the other hand, lower concern about HIV infection was also associated with high risk behavior, supporting the health belief model. Conclusions: Despite the intervention's success in increasing knowledge of HIV and AIDS, the association between knowledge, perceived likelihood of infection and high risk behaviors suggest that, without other alternatives, runaways will maintain their risks. The association noted between lower concern and high risk behaviors underscores the challenge faced in developing effective interventions with this population. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Método: Utilizando un diseño transversal, aproximadamente la mitad de los participantes recibieron entrenamiento en una intervención basada en coetáneos que incluyó principios derivados del modelo de creencias de salud, mientras los sujetos restantes no recibieron ninguna intervención. Los sujetos fueron entrevistados inmediatamente después de la intervención (para los que recibían el entrenamiento) y tres meses má tarde. Se utilizaron la regresión logística y el análisis de covarianza para analizar los efectos de la intervención. Resultados: En comparación a los jóvenes en la condición de control, los que se fugan que recibieron la intervención aumentaron significativamente sus conocimientos acerca del HIV. Contrario al modelo de creencias de salud, en el análisis multivariado el conocimiento y una mayor percepción de la posibilidad del HIV fueron asociadas con la conducta de alto riesgo. En otro sentido, se asoció también menor preocupación acerca de la infección del HIV con conducta de alto riesgo, apoyando el modelo de creencias de salud. Conclusiones: A pesar del éxito de la intervención en aumentar el conocimiento, la percepción de la posibilidad de infección y las conductas de alto riesgo sugieren que, sin otras alternativas, los que se fugan mantendrán sus riesgos.

L'étude a porté sur 244 jeunes qui ont été recrutés dans un centre pour jeunes en détresse. Méthode: La moitié des participants ont reçu une formation leur permettant d'agir en tant qu'intervenants auprès de leurs pairs. Cette formation comprenait des principes tirés de modèles sur les croyances concernant la santé. Les autres participants n'ont reçu aucune formation. On a interviewé les jeunes avant la formation, immédiatement aprè et trois mois plus tard. Résultats: Comparant les jeunes dans le groupe contrôle aux fugueurs qui ont reçu la formation, on note que ces derniers ont amélioré de beaucoup leurs connaissances sur le sida. Contrairement à ce que nous enseignent les modèles de croyances sur la santé, on a noté une corrélation positive entre, d'une part, les connaissances et la perception de devenir victime du sida et d'autre part, le comportement à risque élevé. Par contre, lorsque les jeunes étaient indifférents aux dangers du sida on remarque également des comportements à risque élevé, supportant donc le modèle des croyances de sa santé Conclusions: Même si le programme a réussi à accroître les connaissances sur le sida, la relation entre les connaissances, la perception du risque d'infection et les comportements à risqué porte à croire que les fugueurs maintiendront leurs comportement à risque, à moins d'alternatives différentes. Le lien entre leur insensibilité aux dangers du sida et leur comportement à risque... (French) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare young people seeking homeless services in two distinct geographic locations (Austin, Texas and St. Louis, Missouri). To determine differences between the two populations, the study used a guiding conceptual model of social estrangement that included four domains: institutional disaffiliation, psychological dysfunction, human capital, and identification with homeless culture. A sample of homeless youth (N = 96; 46 from St. Louis, 50 from Austin) were recruited through youth-serving agencies. Findings indicate two unique samples of street-involved youth in regards to affiliation with formal institutions, family support, and informal peer networks, suggesting distinct service needs.

AB  - The article examines gender-specific factors associated with the nonuse of condoms among homeless and runaway youths (HRYs), a population at high risk for HIV infection. Researchers found that nearly a quarter of sexually active HRYs reported never using condoms during the 6-month period prior to their research encounter. Very few HRYs reported consistent condom use during this same period. Compared with males, females were significantly more likely to report nonuse and were significantly less likely to report consistent use. They also found significant gender differences in factors associated with the nonuse of condoms, sexual behavior, stressful life experiences, and psychosocial functioning. These findings underscore the priority to deliver condom-use interventions to female HRYs, and for prevention programs to consider gender issues in the design of interventions to improve condom-use practices. Higher perceived physical abuse among males and having ever been forced to have sex among females was also associated with the nonuse of condoms over a 6-month period. Physical and sexual victimization has been previously associated with multiple sexual partners and drug use among HRYs and unprotected anal intercourse among gay and bisexual men.

AB  - The present study examines differences between homeless adolescents, young adults, and older adults served by homeless shelters or food programs to inform service provision. Four homeless studies using the same sampling and measurement methods were pooled to permit comparisons across age groups. Results showed that homeless adolescents demonstrated greater resilience than younger and older adults. Adolescents reported the shortest duration of homelessness, lowest number of life stressors, fewest physical symptoms, largest social networks, and fewest clinically significant mental health problems. Adolescents also received fewer alcohol and drug abuse diagnoses than younger and older adults. Younger adults reported less time homeless and fewer physical symptoms than older adults, but more life stressors. Younger adults also endorsed higher levels of hostile and paranoid psychological symptoms. Implications for service provision and policy are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - General strain theory posits that adversive circumstances experienced by youths increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. Broidy and Agnew argue that while the underlying process identified in the general strain model will be applicable to both male and female crime different models of strain may be required to highlight gender differences in the underlying process. Utilizing a "high risk" sample of 400 homeless street youths the study examines how socioeconomic strain in the forms of homelessness, monetary dissatisfaction, and relative deprivation may be differentially linked to property and violent crime depending on gender. The conditioning effects of deviant attitudes, deviant peers, attributions, self-efficacy, and self-esteem are also examined. The results reveal few gender differences in the main effects of the different types of strain on crime. There are, however, gender differences in the way the conditioning variables impact the link between forms of strain and crime. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Runaway and homeless youth often have a constellation of background behavioral, emotional, and familial problems that contribute to stress and maladaptive behaviors, which, in turn, can lead to self-harming and suicidal behaviors. The current study examined the roles of stress and maladaptive behaviors as mediators between demographic and psychosocial background characteristics and self-injurious outcomes through the lens of the stress process paradigm. The model was tested in a sample of runaway and homeless youth from Los Angeles County ( N = 474, age 12-24, 41 % female, 17 % White, 32.5 % African American, 21.5 % Hispanic/Latino). Background variables (gender, age, sexual minority status, parental drug use history, and emotional distress) predicted hypothesized mediators of maladaptive behaviors and recent stress. In turn, it was hypothesized that the mediators would predict self-harming behaviors and suicide attempts in the last 3 months. Females and LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) youth were more likely to have self-harmed and attempted suicide; younger participants reported more self-harming. The mediating constructs were associated more highly with self-harming than suicide attempts bivariately, although differences were modest. Maladaptive behaviors and recent stress were significant predictors of self-harm, whereas only recent stress was a significant predictor of suicide attempts. All background factors were significant predictors of recent stress. Older age, a history of parental drug use, and greater emotional distress predicted problem drug use. Males, younger participants, and participants with emotional distress reported more delinquent behaviors. Significant indirect effects on self-harming behaviors were mediated through stress and maladaptive behaviors. The hypothesized paradigm was useful in explaining the associations among background factors and self-injurious outcomes and the influence of mediating factors on these associations.

AB  - A census of homeless youth was conducted in locations across Los Angeles County, California. Building on previous research that has focused on homeless youth in cruise areas, the authors examined demographic and behavioral differences between homeless youth in cruise and noncruise areas. Youth in cruise areas were more likely than youth in noncruise areas to be older, to have been away from home longer, to have recently visited community-based agencies, and were likely to have resided in shelters and less likely to attend school. These data suggest possible selection bias in earlier studies that relied primarily on homeless youth from cruise areas. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Services for homeless youth traditionally provided shelter and nourishment but do little to break the cycle of homelessness. A more comprehensive approach to serve homeless youth is the drop-in center model that provides safe and easy-to-find facilities within communities to bridge the gap between the streets and transitional/permanent housing. Research describing homeless youth who utilize drop-in centers is lacking. This study examines characteristics/ preferences of 96 homeless adolescents attending one of two drop-in centers in Southern California. Homeless youth reported high prevalence of risk behaviors regardless of the center of attendance. Furthermore, our analyses revealed significant differences related to demographics, sexual risk behaviors, and substance use between homeless youth at the two drop-in centers. These findings illuminate the specific characteristics and preferences of homeless youth who attend drop-in centers and can be used to inform providers, advocates, and policy makers.

AB  - This study investigates the relative impact of trauma experiences that occurred prior to and since becoming homeless on depressive symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and self-injurious behaviors among a sample of homeless youth (N = 389). Youth (aged 13 to 25) who had been homeless or precariously housed in the past year completed a survey about housing history, experiences of violence and victimization, mental health, and service utilization. In addition to examining the impact associated with specific trauma types, we also considered the effect of “early-on” poly-victimization (i.e., cumulative number of reported traumas prior to homelessness) and the influence of a compound sexual trauma variable created to represent earlier complex trauma. This created-variable has values ranging from no reported trauma, single trauma, multiple non-sexual traumas, and multiple traumas that co-occurred with sexual abuse. Multivariate analyses revealed that specific traumatic experiences prior to homelessness, including sexual abuse, emotional abuse/neglect, and adverse home environment, predicted greater mental health symptoms. Poly-victimization did not add to the prediction of mental health symptoms after the inclusion of specific traumas. Results with early compound sexual trauma revealed significant differences between lower-order trauma exposures and multiple-trauma exposures. Specifically, experience of multiple traumas that co-occurred with sexual trauma was significantly more detrimental in predicting PTSD symptoms than multiple traumas of non-sexual nature. Findings support the utility of an alternate/novel conceptualization of complex trauma, and support the need to carefully evaluate complex traumatic experiences that occurred prior to homelessness, which can impact the design and implementation of mental health care and services for homeless youth.

AB  - <B>Objective:</B> To examine family risk factors associated with dissociative symptoms among homeless and runaway youth.<B>Method:</B> Three hundred and twenty-eight homeless and runaway youth were interviewed using a systematic sampling strategy in metropolitan Seattle. Homeless young people were interviewed on the streets and in shelters by outreach workers in youth service agencies.<B>Results:</B> The current study revealed widespread prevalence of dissociative symptoms among these young people. Multivariate analyses revealed that sexual abuse, physical abuse, and family mental health problems were all positively associated with dissociative symptoms. No gender differences were found for any of the models.<B>Conclusions:</B> Dissociative behavior is widespread among these youth and may pose a serious mental health concern. Some young people experience numerous stressors, and with few resources and little support available, many may invoke maladaptive strategies such as dissociative behavior to handle such situations, which may in turn be detrimental to their mental health. Unless youth are provided with programs and intervention, the cycle of abuse that they have experienced at home is likely to continue on the street. (English) [Copyright &y& Elsevier]
AB  - <B>Objetivo:</B> Examinar los factores de riesgo familiar asociados con sı´ntomas disociativos entre jo´venes “sin techo” y que se han fugado del domicilio.<B>Me´todo:</B> Un total de 328 jo´venes “sin techo” y que se han fugado del domicilio fueron entrevistados utilizando una estrategia de muestreo sistema´tico en el Area Metropolitana de Seattle. Los jo´venes fueron entrevistados en las calles y en los albergues por trabajadores de las agencias de atencio´n a la juventud.<B>Resultados:</B> El estudio revelo´ una amplia prevalencia de sı´ntomas disociativos entre esta poblacio´n de jo´venes. Los ana´lisis multivariados revelaron que el abuso sexual, maltrato fı´sico y los problemas de salud mental en la familia estaban positivamente asociados con la existencia de sı´ntomas disociativos. No se observaron diferencias de ge´nero en ninguno de los modelos.<B>Conclusiones:</B> La conducta disociativa es frecuente entre estos jo´venes y puede constituir un serio problema de salud mental. Algunos jo´venes esta´n expuestos a numerosas situaciones estresantes y disponen de pocos recursos y apoyo accesible. Muchos de ellos pueden desarrollar estrategias desadaptativas, como la conducta disociativa, para afrontar la situacio´n, lo cual puede afectar negativamente a su salud mental. A menos que se les proporcione a los jo´venes programas e intervenciones, el ciclo de maltrato que han experimentado en casa puede continuar en la calle. (Spanish) [Copyright 2004 Elsevier]

AB  - While there is a growing body of research on intimate partner violence (IPV) experienced by the housed youth population, a limited amount is known about IPV experienced by homeless youth. To our knowledge, no previous studies have examined how homeless youths’ experience of IPV is related to their social network, even though the social networks of homeless youth have been shown to be significant indicators of health and mental health. The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship between IPV, gender, and social networks among a sample of 386 homeless youth in Los Angeles, California. Results revealed that one fifth of the sample experienced IPV in the past year. Stratified regression models revealed that IPV was not significantly related to any measure of male social networks; however, females who experienced IPV had more male friends (β = 2.03, SE = 0.89, p < .05) than females who did not experience IPV. Female homeless youth who witnessed family violence during childhood had more male friends (β = 2.75, SE = 1.08, p < .05), but those who experienced sexual abuse during childhood had fewer male friends (β = −2.04, SE = 0.93, p < .05). Although there was no significant difference in the rate of IPV victimization across genders, the context of this abuse appears to be drastically different. The results suggest that females with more male friendships are at greater risk for exposure to IPV. To date, there are few effective youth-targeted IPV prevention programs and none have been shown to be effective with homeless youth. These results provide insight into future program development.

AB  - A major longitudinal study of runaway and homeless youth resulted in the establishment of a safe house in Calgary. In order to further knowledge building and research in this field, users of the facility are routinely asked to fill out an intake form, and consent is obtained for the use of the information for research purposes. Data collected during the first fourteen months of its operation have now been analyzed. Results are compared to the original survey data to determine which youth are using the facility and which are being missed. Interesting similarities and differences are described and discussed.

AB  - <B>Objective:</B> This study examines the relationship between two explanatory factors connected to the phenomena of runaways and the homeless among adolescents: behavioral problems of youths and parental violence to which they are subjected. The study demonstrates that these two factors are independently related to the different categories of homeless and runaway adolescents.<B>Methodology:</B> The data was collected from 130 adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) who were runaways for short periods on a recurring basis. Two subgroups were formed: Group A consisted of 79 adolescents who did not exhibit behavioral problems; Group B consisted of the other 51 who did exhibit them. The two groups had certain similar family characteristics (income levels, parents’ occupations, structure and stability of the family).<B>Results:</B> The bivariate analyses reveal significant differences between the two groups of runaways relating to: (1) gender, (2) a diagnosed conduct disorder, (3) affiliations with deviant peers, and (4) experiences of parental violence. The discriminant analysis demonstrates that these four variables clearly differentiate the two groups of runaways and predict the appropriate group membership for 84% of the cases. Therefore, the members of Group B have a higher probability of being diagnosed as having a conduct disorder, being male, and associating with delinquent peers. This group had not experienced a higher level of parental violence. The opposite is true for the members of Group A.<B>Conclusion:</B> Our study demonstrates that parental violence and behavioral problems are variables that are independently related to the defined categories of runaways. Therefore, these variables do not constitute, as some thinkers have claimed, the components of a unique dynamic able to explain the phenomenon of the runaway. Our results vitiate the doubts sometimes expressed by researchers about the importance of parental violence to the phenomenon of adolescent runaways. (English) [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

Los miembros de este grupo no habı´an experimentado un nivel elevado de violencia familiar.

AB  - <B>Objectif:</B> Cette e´tude questionne la relation entre deux facteurs explicatifs de la fugue/itine´rance chez les adolescents: les proble&grave;mes de comportement des jeunes et la violence parentale qu’ils subissent. Elle de´montre qu’il s’agit de deux facteurs distincts associe´s a&grave; des profils types de fugueurs.<B>Me´thodologie:</B> Les donne´es ont e´te´ collecte´es aupre&grave;s de 130 adolescents (12 a&grave; 17 ans) qui ont connu des fugues courtes et re´pe´titives. Deux groupes ont e´te´ constitue´: 79 jeunes qui ne pre´sentent pas de proble&grave;mes de comportement (groupe A) et 51 qui en manifestent (groupe B). Les deux groupes sont semblables quant a&grave; certaines caracte´ristiques de leur environnement familial (revenu familial, activite´ du parent, type de famille, stabilite´ familiale).<B>Re´sultats:</B> Les analyses bivarie´es re´ve&grave;lent des diffe´rences significatives entre les deux groupes de fugueurs en ce qui concernent (1) le sexe; (2) le diagnostic de troubles des conduites; (3) l’affiliation a&grave; des personnes de´viantes; et (4) la violence parentale qu’ils subissent. L’analyse discriminante montre que ces quatre variables distinguent nettement les deux groupes de fugueurs et pre´disent l’appartenance de groupe pour 82% des cas. Ainsi le groupe B a plus de chances d’avoir un diagnostic de troubles des conduites, d’eˆtre de sexe masculin et de s’associer a&grave; des pairs de´linquants. Ce groupe ne subit pas un niveau e´leve´ de violence parentale. C’est tout a&grave; fait l’inverse qui caracte´rise le groupe A.<B>Conclusion:</B> Notre e´tude montre que la violence parentale et les troubles de comportements sont des variables associe´es respectivement a&grave; deux profils de fugueurs. Ainsi, ces variables ne constituent pas les composantes d’une dynamique unique susceptible d’expliquer la fugue, comme le pense certains auteurs.

AB  - Historically, insufficient resources and assistance have been provided to young people leaving state care. Care leavers have been found to experience significant health, social and educational deficits including homelessness, disproportionate involvement in juvenile crime and prostitution, poor social supports and early parenthood. This paper compares the UK and Australian debates around improving outcomes for care leavers. Whilst there are some minor differences in the respective legislative frameworks and responses, the similarities are far greater. Both countries have failed to provide the range of in-care, transitional and post-care supports and services required to ensure improved outcomes for care leavers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Running away from home has often been viewed as one of the sequelae to sexual abuse. Our study of 144 adolescent runaways finds that 38% of male runaways (n = 89) and 73% of female runaways (n = 55) report having been sexually abused. The impact of abuse is examined by studying, within each gender group, its relationship to the subject's perceptions of sexual activity, relationships with peers and adults, involvement with delinquent/criminal activities, and physical and emotional complaints. The results of assessing the differences between abused and nonabused adolescents show that both the victimized males and females are more likely to report anxiety and suicidal feelings than are their nonabused counterparts. Male victims of sexual abuse are more likely to report physical symptomatology and fear of adult men. Female victims of sexual abuse are more likely to be confused about sex and to engage in delinquent/criminal activities. Discussion focuses on gender differences and runaway behaviors in relation to sexual victimization with the suggestion that differences in the degree of abuse and the sex of the abuser may explain study findings. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - La fugue, c'est-à-dire la fuite du domicile familial est souvent causée par des sévices sexuels: du moins c'est un point de vue souvent exprimé. Les auteurs ont regardé les dossiers de 144 adolescents fugueurs et ils ont trouvé que le 38% des garcons fugueurs et le 73% des filles fugueuses avaient signalé avoir été victimes de sévices sexuels. L'impact de ces sévices fair l'objet d'une étude plus détaillée dans les deux groupes garçons et filles; cet impact est examiné quant aux perceptions que les sujets présentent de l'activité sexuelle, de leurs relations avec leurs camarades et avec les adultes quant à l'implication dans des activités délinquantes ou criminelles et quant aux plaintes concernant leur état physique ou affectif. En comparant les adolescents victimes de tels sévices avec des adolescents indemnes, on constate que rant les garçons que les filles ont plus tendance à se plaindre de sentiments d'angoisse et de pensées suicidaires que ceux qui n'ont pas été victimes de sévices. Les garçons se plaignent plus facilement de symptômes physiques et craignent les hommes adultes. Les filles victimes d'abus sexuels auront plus tendance à avoir des idées confuses au sujet de la vie sexuelle et auront aussi plus tendance à prendre part à des activités délinquantes ou criminelles.

T1  - Are Social Network Correlates of Heavy Drinking Similar Among Black Homeless Youth and White Homeless Youth?

AB  - Objective: Understanding factors associated with heavy drinking among homeless youth is important for prevention efforts. Social networks are associated with drinking among homeless youth, and studies have called for attention to racial differences in networks that may affect drinking behavior. This study investigates differences in network characteristics by the racial background of homeless youth, and associations of network characteristics with heavy drinking. (Heavy drinking was defined as having five or more drinks of alcohol in a row within a couple of hours on at least one day within the past 30 days.) Method: A probability sample of 235 Black and White homeless youths ages 13-24 were interviewed in Los Angeles County. We used chi-square or one-way analysis of variance tests to examine network differences by race and logistic regressions to identify network correlates of heavy drinking among Black and White homeless youth. Results: The networks of Black youth included significantly more relatives and students who attend school regularly, whereas the networks of White youth were more likely to include homeless persons, relatives who drink to intoxication, and peers who drink to intoxication. Having peers who drink heavily was significantly associated with heavy drinking only among White youth. For all homeless youth, having more students in the network who regularly attend school was associated with less risk of heavy drinking. Conclusions: This study is the first to our knowledge to investigate racial differences in network characteristics and associations of network characteristics with heavy drinking among homeless youth. White homeless youth may benefit from interventions that reduce their ties with peers who drink. Enhancing ties to school-involved peers may be a promising intervention focus for both Black and White homeless youth. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Most of what we know about sexual abuse comes from efforts to examine female children victimized by men. Although some researchers have identified similarities between male and female victims of sexual abuse, few studies have examined gender-specific factors associated with sexual health practices among homeless adolescents. The aim of this study was to explore how gender and history of sexual abuse influence cognitive-perceptual and behavioral factors associated with sexual health practices of homeless adolescents. This study was a secondary analysis of data collected for a cross-sectional study of the sexual health practices of homeless adolescents. The sample consisted of 414 youths (104 males who reported sexual abuse and 124 who did not; and 95 females who reported sexual abuse and 75 who did not; 16 did not provide these data). Homeless adolescent females with a history of sexual abuse scored higher (indicating a shorter perspective) on a measure of future time perspective than females with no sexual abuse. Males who reported no sexual abuse scored higher than abused females on perceived health status and higher than abused males on assertive communication. With respect to perceived health status, males who reported no sexual abuse scored significantly higher than females who reported sexual abuse (p = .04). Males with no sexual abuse had significantly higher assertive communication scores than did males who had experienced sexual abuse (p = .015). We found that male and female abuse victims differ in terms of their cognitive-perceptual and behavioral factors associated with sexual health practices. Early identification of those who have been abused is critical so that interventions can be developed. Effective short-term interventions are needed for the adolescent victims of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA), particularly those who are homeless and prone to further sexual victimization.

AB  - There are two factors that limit the knowledge of the risk factors associated with homelessness among runaway adolescents, namely, (a) the samples used are often composed of youth homeless service users and/or youths living on the streets (visible homelessness), whereas most adolescents in fact use 'private' resources (hidden homelessness), and (b) failure to use an adequate control group to identify risk factors associated specifically with homelessness. This study compares the characteristics of two groups of youths under the supervision of the youth protection system, according to the presence of absence or periods of homelessness. The results throw light on the factors underlying the shift from 'at risk' to 'homeless,' showing that youths with experience of homelessness are more likely to have been placed in substitute home environments, have experienced significant relationship difficulties with one of their parents (deterioration of the parent/youth relationship and parental abuse), and have been diagnosed with behavioral disorders. The findings suggest that the decision to place young people under supervision is based more on the dynamic between risk factors rather than on the existence of behavioral problems.

AB  - The current study employs data from the U.S. National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 10,818; 56% female; 21% African American) to test how experiencing homelessness through emerging adulthood and child maltreatment predict adult property crime and violent crime. Unlike many published studies on homelessness, we used propensity score matching to correct for selection bias between homeless and nonhomeless individuals. Logistic regression models were run to predict violent and property crime in adulthood, controlling for child maltreatment. Participants who experienced homelessness by age 26 were 1.6 times more likely to commit violent crime in adulthood and almost 30% more likely to commit property crime. Those who were victims of child maltreatment were 15 times more likely to commit property crime, but no more likely to commit violent crime. Findings show that comparing statistically equivalent groups, homelessness through emerging adulthood significantly predicted adult criminality while child maltreatment showed more variable results. Greater prevention efforts aimed at children and adolescents at high risk of experiencing homelessness, as well as more intensive outreach services to homeless youth, may moderate exposure and reduce reliance on criminal survival behaviors.

AB  - The primary aim of this study was to describe the abuse experiences of sexually exploited runaway adolescents seen at a Child Advocacy Center ( N = 62). We also sought to identify risk behaviors, attributes of resiliency, laboratory results for sexually transmitted infection (STI) screens, and genital injuries from colposcopic exams. We used retrospective mixed-methods with in-depth forensic interviews, together with self-report survey responses, physical exams and chart data. Forensic interviews were analyzed using interpretive description analytical methods along domains of experience and meaning of sexual exploitation events. Univariate descriptive statistics characterized trauma responses and health risks. The first sexual exploitation events for many victims occurred as part of seemingly random encounters with procurers. Older adolescent or adult women recruited some youth working for a pimp. However, half the youth did not report a trafficker involved in setting up their exchange of sex for money, substances, or other types of consideration. 78% scored positive on the UCLA PTSD tool; 57% reported DSM IV criteria for problem substance use; 71% reported cutting behaviors, 75% suicidal ideation, and 50% had attempted suicide. Contrary to common depictions, youth may be solicited relatively quickly as runaways, yet exploitation is not always linked to having a pimp. Avoidant coping does not appear effective, as most patients exhibited significant symptoms of trauma. Awareness of variations in youth's sexual exploitation experiences may help researchers and clinicians understand potential differences in sequelae, design effective treatment plans, and develop community prevention programs.

AB  - Objectives: Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) populations exhibit elevated rates of psychiatric disorders compared to heterosexuals, and these disparities emerge early in the life course. We examined the role of exposure to early-life victimization and adversity—including physical and sexual abuse, homelessness, and intimate partner violence—in explaining sexual orientation disparities in mental health among adolescents and young adults. Methods: Data were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, Wave 3 (2001–2002), a nationally representative survey of adolescents. Participants included gay/lesbian (n =227), bisexual (n =245), and heterosexual (n =13,490) youths, ages 18–27. We examined differences in the prevalence of exposure to child physical or sexual abuse, homelessness or expulsion from one's home by caregivers, and physical and sexual intimate partner violence according to sexual orientation. Next we examined the associations of these exposures with symptoms of psychopathology including suicidal ideation and attempts, depression, binge drinking, illicit drug use, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse. Finally, we determined whether exposure to victimization and adversity explained the association between sexual orientation and psychopathology. Results: Gay/lesbian and bisexual respondents had higher levels of psychopathology than heterosexuals across all outcomes. Gay/lesbian respondents had higher odds of exposure to child abuse and housing adversity, and bisexual respondents had higher odds of exposure to child abuse, housing adversity, and intimate partner violence, than heterosexuals. Greater exposure to these adversities explained between 10 and 20% of the relative excess of suicidality, depression, tobacco use, and symptoms of alcohol and drug abuse among LGB youths compared to heterosexuals. Exposure to victimization and adversity experiences in childhood and adolescence significantly mediated the association of both gay/lesbian and bisexual orientation with suicidality, depressive symptoms, tobacco use, and alcohol abuse. Conclusions: Exposure to victimization in early-life family and romantic relationships explains, in part, sexual orientation disparities in a wide range of mental health and substance use outcomes, highlighting novel targets for preventive interventions aimed at reducing these disparities.

AB  - Objectives: It has been proposed that homeless street girls are more likely to be from dysfunctional families and exhibit psychological distress than homeless street boys, reflecting cultural factors that result in differential norms for male and female behavior. The current analysis examined whether male and female street youth in a mid-sized Brazilian city differed in their family circumstances and day-to-day functioning on the street. Methods: The opportunity sample consisted of 33 male (mean age 14.3, range 10-17 years) and 33 female (mean age 14.6, range 11-18 years) street youth who participated in a sentence completion task and structured interview examining family experiences and ability to meet daily needs on the street. Results: Consistent with the cultural hypothesis, girls described more negative family backgrounds than boys (e.g., they were more likely to have left home because of conflict or abuse, and reported more negative relationships with their parents). However, girls' functioning on the street was similar to, and in some cases more positive than, that of boys (e.g., fewer girls reported police violence and begging to earn money). Conclusions: The few gender differences that emerged in this study offer little support for the cultural hypothesis. The findings make sense if local factors, such as services available for male and female youth and public response to street youth, are considered. It appears that street youth differ in their experiences depending on local circumstances, highlighting the need for caution in generalizing about the situation of street youth in different countries.

AB  - Objective: This study examined the differential effects of various forms of abuse, as well as their combined effects. The study also sought to separate the factors uniquely associated with abuse from those associated with the more general problems present in an abusive family environment. Methodology: Data were collected from 329 homeless adolescents. Preliminary analyses indicated some degree of matching for family background variables. Any differences in demographic or family characteristics were controlled for statistically. Results: Chi-square analyses revealed significant differences across groups for rates of assault, rape, depression/dysthymia, and attempted suicide. Multivariate analyses (MANOVAs) indicated significant differences in severity of internalizing problems and cognitive problems. Without exception, the group with histories of both physical and sexual abuse exhibited the most severe symptomatology and was at greatest risk for revictimization. Multiple regression analyses suggested that abuse histories were predictive of internalizing problems while family characteristics were more predictive of externalizing problems. Conclusions: The findings indicate that both abuse type and family characteristics contribute to the development of symptomatology. Future prospective and longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the sequelae of abuse, as well as the possible cause and effect relations between abuse, family characteristics, and psychological outcome.

AB  - Runaway is a status offense for which there is concern that youths, particularly girls, are vulnerable to the "evils of the streets" Prior research suggests that many personal and family risks of runaway are gendered, that the streets may be meaner, and that the strategies for survival disproportionately serve to criminalize girls. Moreover, patriarchial values may make the juvenile justice response to runaway girls overly harsh "for their own good." Unfortunately, research has been hampered by small or biased samples. This study examines many risk factors to discern patterns and gender differences among runaway youths for whom there is a status offense charged. Many charged runaway youths are followed to determine the nature of official responses and whether responses appear gendered. The findings have implications for changes in how officials respond to runaway youths, both in terms of what will better serve the youths' best interests and for improving public safety.

AB  - This qualitative study examined the meanings ascribed to the construct “home” by 208 youths defined by mainstream society as “homeless”. Youth narratives on the topic of home ranged across a continuum with home as state at one end (i.e., home is a state of mind, comprised of one’s friends) and home as place at the other (i.e., home as a physical dwelling). Youths employing the former meanings had typically been on the street for longer periods and identified with counterculture-type ideologies. For youths who defined home as place, home was constructed in direct opposition to street experiences. For both of these groups, control emerged as a central theme in their narratives. The implications of these findings for engaging youth and goal setting regarding exiting the streets are described. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - In this largely exploratory study of the conflict management and coping behavior of homeless adolescents, the authors interviewed 176 families (mother- adolescent dyads) living in New York City welfare hotels. Results indicated that peer conflict was the "worst" problem of the previous month as reported by approximately 50% of these youth. Homeless adolescents demonstrated conflict management and coping patterns that differed in certain respects from adolescent patterns previously described in the literature. The implications of these differences as well as directions for future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - When we see the numerous risks that young people face on the street or cause for others, one can forget that the so called «at risk» behaviour are displays of deeper lying issues. While the ideal of individual auto-realization values certain forms of at risk behaviour, one can also discern the existence in our societies an obsession with safety that targets at risk populations. Based an a survey conducted in Montreal with street youth, this article aims to clarify the difference between the meaning attributed by youth to marginality and normality and the political tendency to favour epidemiological and safety oriented approaches toward these populations. It concludes with an analysis of the effects of these approaches in relation to the recognition an the youth street exit process. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - La abundancia de cifras sobre los riesgos que los jóvenes de la calle corren o hacen correr a otros puede hacernos olvidar que los susodichos comportamientos "de riesgo" no son más que manifestaciones de problemas más profundos. En efecto, al mismo tiempo que en que el ideal de realización individual se valorizan ciertas formas de toma de riesgo, en el seno de nuestras sociedades se presenta una obsesión sobre la seguridad centrada en la gestión de las poblaciones en riesgo. A partir de una investigación realizada con jóvenes que han dejado la calle en Montreal, este artículo busca ilustrar la divergencia existente entre el sentido atribuido por los jóvenes a la marginalidad y a la normalidad y las tendencias políticas a privilegiar el enfoque epidemiológico y de seguridad en relación con estas poblaciones, además del efecto que ello tiene sobre estas últimas en términos de reconocimiento del proceso de retiro de estos jóvenes de las calles.

Alors que l'idéal d'autoréalisation individuelle valorise certaines formes de prise de risques, on constate simultanément la présence importante au sein de nos sociétés d'une obsession sécuritaire qui vise la gestion des populations à risque. À partir d'une enquête auprès de jeunes sortis de la rue réalisée à Montréal, le présent article vise à mettre en lumière l'écart entre le sens attribué par les jeunes à la marginalité et é la normalité et la tendance politique à privilégier des approches épidémiologique et sécuritaire à l'égard de ces populations. Il se conclut par une analyse des effets de ces approches en termes de reconnaissance sur le processus de sortie de la rue de ces jeunes. (French) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study examines national and regional differences between runaway shelter users and national census norms on demographic and high-risk characteristics. Data collected from federally funded youth shelters nationwide (n= 16,652) were compared with U.S. adolescent populations (n= 26,735,028). Runaway youth were more likely to be female, minority, and older than respective national figures, but ethnicity varied greatly from one region of the United States to another. Proportions of youth with high-risk characteristics, such as illicit drug use and selling, suicidal behaviors, and physical and sexual abuse, were strikingly different across regions. Overall, the identification of regional differences should encourage individual regions, states, and agencies to develop policies and services that target specific youth in their area. Further research is also needed to understand runaway youth, especially as a heterogeneous group of high-risk adolescents.

AB  - Adolescents who run away from home frequently give many reasons for their behavior, but rarely has an examination of physical maltreatment as a precipitating factor for leaving home been carefully conducted. The Conflict Tactics Scale, a measure of how families resolve conflicts, was completed by 199 adolescents who ran away to a youth shelter. Some 78% of the adolescents self-reported significant physical violence directed toward themselves by a parent in the one year prior to their running away. There were no significant effects of age or sex on the amount of physical violence. A comparison between runaway adolescents and adolescents labeled abused reveals no significant differences in at-risk child abuse scores. An argument is presented for crisis counselors and youth shelter workers to more carefully examine and treat family violence in adolescents who run. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Les adolescents qui font des fugues donnent toutes sortes d'explications pour leur conduite: on ne s'est pas souvent posé la question de savoir si, à l'origine de la fugue, il n'y avait pas parfois des sévices physiques. Les auteurs ont soumis 199 adolescents qui avaient fait des fugues et qui se trouvaient dans un lieu d'accueil à un "'score de résolution" des conflits qui est une mesure servant à évaluer comment les familles, en fait, se débrouillent dans les conflits. Le 78% des adolescents ont dit qu'ils avaient été l'objet de sévices de la part d'un des parents dans l'année précédant leur fugue. Il n'y avait pas de différence d'âge ou de sexe en ce qui concerne cette violence physique. Les index de risque utilisés dans le domaine des sévices à l'égard d'enfants n'ont pas montré non plus de différences entre ces adolescents. Les auteurs suggérent que les conseillers de crise et les travailleurs sociaux attachés aux foyers d'accueil pour jeunes fugueurs devraient se pencher avec plus d'attention sur la possibilité de violence intra-familiale, à l'origine de l'acte de fuite.

AB  - Although lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth with a history of homelessness (running away or being evicted from their homes by parents) report more psychological symptoms than homeless heterosexual peers, it is unclear whether symptoms are due to homelessness, given the absence of a non-homeless comparison group. This study longitudinally investigates whether LGB youth with a history of homelessness report more subsequent psychological symptoms than non-homeless LGB youth and examines potential mediators of any such relationships. Of the 156 LGB youth interviewed (49% female; 78% non-White), 48% reported past homeless experiences. Homelessness was associated with subsequent symptoms of anxiety, depression, conduct problems, and substance abuse and to changes in symptoms over time even after controlling for childhood sexual abuse and early development of sexual orientation. Stressful life events, negative social relationships, and social support from friends mediated the relationships between homelessness and symptomatology. These findings suggest the need for interventions to reduce stress and enhance social support among LGB youth with a history of homelessness in order to reduce psychological symptoms.

AB  - Travelers are a migratory subgroup of homeless youth who may be especially prone to engaging in risky behavior. This study compared the substance use and sexual behavior of young homeless travelers and non-travelers to evaluate the extent and possible sources of travelers' increased risk. Data came from face-to-face interviews with 419 homeless youth (36.6% female, 34.0% white, 23.9% African American, and 20.0% Hispanic) between the ages of 13 and 24 years ( M = 20.1 years, SD = 2.5) who were randomly sampled from 41 shelters, drop-in centers, and street sites in Los Angeles. Travelers were almost twice as likely as non-travelers to exhibit recent heavy drinking, 37% more likely to exhibit recent marijuana use, and five times as likely to have injected drugs. Travelers also had more recent sex partners and were more likely to report having casual or need-based sexual partners and combining sex with substance use. Mediation analyses suggest that travelers' deviant peer associations and disconnection to conventional individuals and institutions may drive their elevated substance use. Differences in sexual risk behaviors are likely attributable to demographic differences between the two groups. Overall, these differences between travelers and non-travelers suggest different service needs and the need for different service approaches. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Most of what we know about sexual abuse comes from efforts to examine female children victimized by men. Although some researchers have identified similarities between male and female victims of sexual abuse, few studies have examined gender-specific factors associated with sexual health practices among homeless adolescents. The aim of this study was to explore how gender and history of sexual abuse influence cognitive-perceptual and behavioral factors associated with sexual health practices of homeless adolescents. This study was a secondary analysis of data collected for a cross-sectional study of the sexual health practices of homeless adolescents. The sample consisted of 414 youths (104 males who reported sexual abuse and 124 who did not; and 95 females who reported sexual abuse and 75 who did not; 16 did not provide these data). Homeless adolescent females with a history of sexual abuse scored higher (indicating a shorter perspective) on a measure of future time perspective than females with no sexual abuse. Males who reported no sexual abuse scored higher than abused females on perceived health status and higher than abused males on assertive communication. With respect to perceived health status, males who reported no sexual abuse scored significantly higher than females who reported sexual abuse (p = .04). Males with no sexual abuse had significantly higher assertive communication scores than did males who had experienced sexual abuse (p = .015). We found that male and female abuse victims differ in terms of their cognitive-perceptual and behavioral factors associated with sexual health practices. Early identification of those who have been abused is critical so that interventions can be developed. Effective short-term interventions are needed for the adolescent victims of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA), particularly those who are homeless and prone to further sexual victimization.

AB  - The high rates of substance use among American adolescents are challenging; however, runaway youth are at particularly high-risk for substance use. Runaway youth utilizing two service sectors, emergency crisis shelters and juvenile detention centers, were recruited to evaluate differences in risk factors associated with substance use. Findings demonstrate that youth admitted to juvenile detention (n = 121) had proportionally higher levels of problem behaviors, including substance use, than youth admitted to shelter services (n = 156). Both groups of youth have significantly higher levels of substance use than national estimates. The most significant risk factor for alcohol and marijuana use among youth in both groups was using other substances. Addressing issues of substance abuse among runaway youth must be a prime objective for future research and treatment for this high-risk population. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study explored the gender differences in sexual self-concept, personal resources for sexual health, safe sex behaviors, and risky sexual behaviors among homeless adolescents with and without histories of sexual abuse. Data for this secondary analysis were collected in 2003 to 2004 in the first phase of a larger repeated-measures sexual health intervention study; 371 homeless youth between 16 and 23 years of age (M = 19.26, SD = 1.83) were recruited from a street outreach center. The majority (64.6%) of participants were males. Self-report instruments were completed at the outreach center via audio computer-assisted self-interview (A-CASI) format. It was found that female participants were better off than males on numerous measures of sexual health behaviors and attitudes. Sexually abused participants had significantly less future time perspective (p = .05), fewer sexual self-care behaviors (p = .04), and less social support than nonabused participants (p = .01) and almost significantly more sexual risk-taking (p = .08). However, no significant differences were found between abused and nonabused participants on sexual self-concept, self-efficacy or intention to use condoms, safe sex behaviors, AIDS knowledge, assertive communication, or self-efficacy to perform testicular/ breast self-exams. Overall, participants who did not report a history of sexual abuse had significantly more sexual health resources and engaged in fewer sex-risk behaviors than those who reported having been abused. These differences have notable implications for screening adolescents for a history of sexual abuse. Adolescents who report sexual abuse should receive risk counseling and be screened regularly for the development of sexual risk behaviors. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study examines the 12-month prevalence and demographic predictors of running away during adolescence. Data were obtained from Waves I and II of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health; the final sample was comprised of 134 schools from 80 communities within 33 states. More than 6% of youths reported running away. Running away was predicted by biological gender, age, region, urbanicity, and family structure. The finding that females were more likely to run away than males is unexpected given prior research showing that males are more likely to have spent the night in a shelter, public place, outside, or in a stranger's home. Regional differences in runaways are also unexpected, and more research is needed on this topic as there may be local-level policy implications. Future research should also attempt to identify the specific factors that incline some subgroups (e.g., youth from disrupted families) to run away, as well as behavioral predictors and the long-term outcomes of running away.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims  A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the methodological quality and effectiveness of behavioural smoking cessation interventions targeted at six disadvantaged groups; the homeless, prisoners, indigenous populations, at-risk youth, individuals with low socio-economic status and individuals with a mental illness. Methods  Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and PsycInfo databases were searched using MeSH and keywords for studies conducted in developed countries prior to October 2010. Included studies were assessed for methodological quality. A DerSimonian and Laird random effects meta-analysis was conducted where possible to explore the effectiveness of interventions for the different subgroups. A narrative review was conducted for studies unable to be included in the meta-analysis. Outcomes examined were abstinence rates at short-term (up to 3 months) and long-term (6 months or the longest) follow-up. Results  Thirty-two relevant studies were identified. The majority ( n = 20) were rated low in methodological quality. Results of the meta-analysis showed a significant increase in cessation for behavioural support interventions targeted at low-income female smokers at short-term follow-up [relative risk (RR) 1.68, confidence interval (CI) 1.21-2.33], and behavioural support interventions targeted at individuals with a mental illness at long-term follow-up (RR 1.35, CI 1.01-1.81). Results of the narrative review showed several promising interventions that increased cessation rates at 6-month or longer follow-up. Conclusions  Few well-controlled trials have examined the most effective smoking cessation strategies for highly disadvantaged groups, especially among the homeless, indigenous smokers and prisoners. The use of behavioural smoking cessation interventions for some socially disadvantaged groups appears promising; however, overall findings are inconsistent. Further research is needed to establish the most effective interventions for vulnerable high-risk groups. Special attention should be given to increasing sample size and power, and to sound evaluation methodology to overcome methodological limitations of conducting research with these high-risk groups.

AB  - This study describes the characteristics of youth who use secure crisis residential centers (CRC) in Washington State. In 1995, Washington State implemented policies for at-risk youth intended to protect children and help families reconcile. Known as the "Becca Bill," the policies include court intervention for youth and provisions for mandatory treatment at CRCs. Specifically, the research examines youth who entered CRCs prior to mid-1999, and recounts what parents and caretakers had to say about their family situations following their child's stay in a secure CRC. Data were obtained from surveys completed in 2001 by 64 individuals involved in the program. Following a Becca admission, 34% of youth were referred to Family Reconciliation Services, and 75% of the parents receiving these services reported them to be very or somewhat helpful. During the 18 months following a Becca admission, 25% of youth had at least one criminal conviction, 39% of which were felonies. After their release from secure CRCs, 72% of Becca youth lived with their parents, and 47% of parents thought that their child's relationship with the family had improved "a little" or "a lot." Only 16% reported that the relationship had worsened. Because it was not possible to create a comparison group, these results cannot evaluate whether the Becca Bill actually works.

After their release from secure CRCs, 72% of Becca youth lived with their parents, and 47% of parents thought that their child's relationship with the family had improved "a little" or "a lot." Only 16% reported that the relationship had worsened. Because it was not possible to create a comparison group, these results cannot evaluate whether the Becca Bill actually works.

AB  - This study describes the characteristics of youth who use secure crisis residential centers (CRC) in Washington State. In 1995, Washington State implemented policies for at-risk youth intended to protect children and help families reconcile. Known as the "Becca Bill," the policies include court intervention for youth and provisions for mandatory treatment at CRCs. Specifically, the research examines youth who entered CRCs prior to mid-1999, and recounts what parents and caretakers had to say about their family situations following their child's stay in a secure CRC. Data were obtained from surveys completed in 2001 by 64 individuals involved in the program. Following a Becca admission, 34% of youth were referred to Family Reconciliation Services, and 75% of the parents receiving these services reported them to be very or somewhat helpful. During the 18 months following a Becca admission, 25% of youth had at least one criminal conviction, 39% of which were felonies. After their release from secure CRCs, 72% of Becca youth lived with their parents, and 47% of parents thought that their child's relationship with the family had improved "a little" or "a lot." Only 16% reported that the relationship had worsened. Because it was not possible to create a comparison group, these results cannot evaluate whether the Becca Bill actually works.

AB  - Runaway youth report a broader range and higher severity of substance-related, mental health, and family problems relative to nonrunaway youth. Most studies to date have collected self-report data on the family and social history; virtually no research has examined treatment effectiveness with this population. This study is a treatment development project in which 124 runaway youth were randomly assigned to (a) ecologically based family therapy (EBFT) or (b) service as usual (SAU) through a shelter. Youth completed an intake, posttreatment, and 6 and 12 months follow-up assessments. Youth assigned to EBFT reported greater reductions in overall substance abuse compared with youth assigned to SAU, whereas other problem areas improved in both conditions. Findings suggest that EBFT is an efficacious intervention for this relatively severe population of youth.

AB  - Adolescence is a developmental period during which many youth experiment with risk practices. This paper examined the association of parental monitoring with a range of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use behaviors among high-risk youth, while controlling for other demographic and environmental variables previously found to be associated with AOD use. Participants were recruited as part of a longitudinal evaluation study of four youth drop-in centers located in Southern California. These centers served at-risk youth, including Hispanic, Lesbian/ Gay/Bisexual/Questioning (LGBQ), and homeless and runaway youth. Participants were aged 14 to 24 and were new attendees at the drop-in centers. Results from logistic regression analyses revealed that while controlling for demographic and environmental variables, adolescents who reported less parental monitoring were more likely to report lifetime use of cigarettes, marijuana, and methamphetamine, and in the past three months, use of alcohol and binge drinking. The findings thus indicate that, even among high-risk youth, those who reported low parental monitoring were significantly more likely to use a variety of substances. Implications of these findings are discussed as they pertain to AOD prevention and interventions for children and their families. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study explores the victimization experiences of street youth living in Toronto, Canada. In particular, it is argued that street youth are much more likely than domiciled youth to be victims of a broad range of crimes; and that young women who are homeless face increased vulnerability to specific forms of violent crime, including sexual assault. Data were part of a larger study of legal and justice issues facing street youth, and consisted of interviews with 208 homeless youth living in Toronto in 2001. The incredibly high rate of criminal victimization experienced by street youth means that they are forced to live from day to day with the very real fear of theft and robbery, or being attacked or sexually assaulted. However, the circumstances that produce high levels of criminal victimization among street youth are myriad and complex. While background variables (a history of violence), lifestyle, and routine activities theories have been used to explain criminal victimization, the conditions that place street youth at risk are connected to their experiences of social exclusion in terms of restricted access to housing, employment, and public spaces. Being young and homeless in Toronto, therefore, means many things--among the most significant being that one's health and safety are jeopardized on a day-to-day basis and that this is not incidentally related to one's experience of social exclusion. Further, because of the difficulties obtaining and maintaining regular jobs, street youth adopt subsistence strategies that are quasi-leal or illegal, and which expose them to a range of potentially dangerous and exploitive persons. Overall, then, alienation, distance, and vulnerability to crime can be considered as both consequences and manifestations of social exclusion. As such, public safety strategies, whether developed by governments, community groups, or the police, must consider the safety of all citizens, including those who are rightly or wrongly perceived to be dangerous, different, and "outside" the definition of the community, such as the homeless.

AB  - Although adolescents are severely and chronically physically abused, relatively little attention has been directed towards understanding this phenomenon. This study explored the family characteristics and the behavioral- emotional reactions of 77 adolescents who were physically maltreated. The youths were selected at a number of sites including a runaway shelter, a hospital-based child abuse team, and a protective service unit. Six different patterns of adolescent reaction to abuse were identified: acting-out, depression, generalized anxiety, extreme adolescent adjustment, emotional-thought disturbance, and helplessness-dependency. Abuse toward these youth had been ongoing for an average of nearly five years. As there were no differences in family characteristics and emotional-behavioral reactions between subjects who were abused only during adolescence (including single-incident abuse) and subjects for whom family violence was evident from childhood on, the utility of a developmentally specific system of abuse categorization is questioned. It is suggested that it is the pattern of parent and child interaction rather than the course of the maltreatment that is related to the emotional and behavioral dysfunction of the adolescent victim. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - La violence à l'égard des adolescents est souvent grave et chronique mais les mécanismes qui conduisent à ces mauvais traitements sont difficiles à comprendre Les auteurs ont étudie les caracteristiques familiales et les réactions affectives ainsi que le comportement de 77 adolescents qui étaient victimes de sévices. Ces jeunes gens ont été rencontrés à plusieurs endroits. Certains provenaient d'un abri pour fugueurs, d'autres ont éte référés par une equipe pluridisciplinaire affiliée à l'hôpital et d'autres enfin ont été repertories grâce à une agence de protection de l'enfance. Les auteurs ont pu diviser les réactions des adolescents à la violence en six catégories: acting-out (défi), dépression, angoisse profonde, tentative extême d'adaptation; perturbation de l'affect et de la pensée, et enfin sentiment d'impuissance avec dépendance totale. En moyenne, ces jeunes gens avaient été maltraités pendant déjà cinq années. Les auteurs n'ont pas trouvé de différence dans les caracteristiques familiales et les réactions affectives et du comportement entre les sujets qui avaient été maltraités seulement à partir de l'adolescence et ceux pour qui la violence était le pain quotidien depuis l'enfance. En conséquence, on peut se demander si le classement en catégories liées à un système specifique du développement est vraiment utile. Les auteurs suggèrent que c'est le style de relations entre les parents et les intéressés qui est déterminant plutôt que le déroulement chronologique de la maltraitance qui est important. Ce style de relations détermine le comportement affectif et général de l'adolescent. (French) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study examines a comprehensive intervention for homeless street youth that addresses substance use, social stability, physical, and mental health issues. Street-living youth aged 14 to 22 were recruited from a drop-in center and randomly assigned to the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) or treatment as usual (TAU) through a drop-in center. Findings showed that youth assigned to CRA, compared to TAU, reported significantly reduced substance use (37% vs. 17% reduction), depression (40% vs. 23%), and increased social stability (58% vs. 13%). Youth in both conditions improved in many other behavioral domains as well including substance use, internalizing and externalizing problems, and emotion and task-oriented coping. Overall, these results indicate that homeless youth can be engaged into treatment and respond favorably to intervention efforts. However, more treatment development research is needed to address the barriers associated with serving these youth.

AB  - This report provides a statistical profile of female juvenile offenders in Hawaii. It utilizes two main data sets: CY 2004 Juvenile Justice Information System data and family court case file information on juvenile offenders who were either on probation or incarcerated at the Hawaii Youth Correctional Facility (HYCF). The report first examines general trends in juvenile arrests and adjudications, focusing on gender and racial/ethnic differences in each category. It then analyzes gender differences in the social, psychological, family, drug use, and academic backgrounds in the case file sample. Finally, the report examines intragender differences between HYCF girls and non-HYCF girls. What gender differences exist in juvenile arrests and adjudications? The study data reveal that runaway and truancy were numerically and proportionally the top two charges for both boys and girls during CY 2004. However, the number of runaway arrests for girls was 47% higher than for boys, whereas boys had 56% more arrests for truancy. In addition, three of the top five arrest charges for girls included status offenses: runaway, truancy, and beyond parental control. Three of the top five arrests for boys included law violations, two of which were person offenses: assault 3, theft 4, and harassment. The strongest predictor of adjudication was offense severity. Two other predictors, however, were also statistically significant when controlling for offense severity; juveniles who reside in Maui County and girls in general were less likely to be adjudicated.

AB  - Runaway youths represent a neglected clinical group, and few studies have examined ethnicity differences within this population. Substance use, family functioning and related problem behaviors were examined in a sample of Hispanic and Anglo runaway youths with substance abuse diagnoses (N = 145). Youths, aged 12-17, were recruited from two urban, southwestern runaway shelters. Within single-parent families, Anglo youths reported more marijuana use, and, regardless of family constitution, reported more tobacco use than did Hispanic youths. Overall, Anglo youths reported more externalizing problems and more conflict tactics used in resolving disagreements with their primary caretaker while Hispanic youths reported higher depression and familism scores. Given the differences found between Hispanic and Anglo youths, the findings argue that culturally sensitive interventions for runaway youths and families are warranted. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This research explores family functioning and related problem behaviors among 145 Hispanic and white runaways with drug use diagnosesߞa neglected research population. Runaway youths are a neglected clinical group, and few studies have examined ethnic differences in this population. This study drew on respondents, aged 12 to 17, recruited from two uRB an runaway shelters in the Southwest. The psychological test battery included: the Conflict Tactics Scale, the Family Environment Scale, the Form 90, and the Computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children. Among respondents raised in single-parent families, whites reported greater marijuana use and, regardless of family constitution, more tobacco use than did Hispanics. Overall, whites also reported more externalizing of problems and more conflict tactics used to resolve disagreements with their primary caretakers, while Hispanics reported higher scores for depression and "familism." Practitioners should develop culturally-sensitive interventions for runaway youths and their families.

AB  - Objective: Examined the question, do neglected children's perceptions of their own family's functioning acknowledge the differences that exist between neglectful and non-neglectful families? Method: An inter-rater consistency design was used; child and caseworker reports of family functioning in neglectful (n = 33) and non-neglectful families (n = 34) were compared. Results: After establishing significant differences between the socioemotional and physical environment provided by neglectful and non-neglectful families, the results indicated that children from neglectful families perceived a higher level of quality in family functioning that was not reported by caseworkers or supported by other measures. Conclusions: Implications for designing effective interventions for school-age and adolescent children from neglectful families are discussed. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objectif: Cette étude a tenté de répondre à la question "Est-ce que les enfants négligés, vu leurs expériences familiales, perçoivent les différences qui existent entre des familles négligentes et des familles non négligentes?" Méthode: On a comparé les rapports que les enfants et les travailleurs sociaux ont fournis sur le fonctionnement des familles négligentes (N = 33) et des familles non négligentes (N = 34), s'assurant à la fois qu'il y avait cohérence parmi ces deux sources. Résultats: L'étude a établi qu'il existait des différences importantes entre le milieu socio-émotionnel et le milieu matériel des deux types de familles. L'étude a aussi démontré que les enfants de familles négligentes jugeaient le fonctionnement des familles comme étant plus adéquat que ne le faisaient les travailleurs sociaux. Conclusions: Les auteurs discutent de l'importance d'intervenir de façon efficace auprès des enfants d'âge scolaire et des adolescents qui sont issus de familles négligentes.

AB  - In his control balance theory Charles Tittle maintained that under favorable conditions unbalanced control ratios will lead to different forms of deviance. The type of deviance chosen is argued to depend on the degree of the control imbalance and the desirability the offense presents as a method of altering the imbalance. Utilizing a sample of homeless street youth this study examined if different types of control balance ratios were associated with hard and soft drug use. The findings revealed that control balance surpluses and control balance deficits were both related to hard and soft drug use but that these relationships were significantly stronger for hard drug use. Further, provocation and self-control were significant predictors of hard but not soft drug use while drug using peers predicted soft drug use but not hard drug use. Parental drug use, perceptions of risk, and values supportive of illegal behavior predicted both forms of drug use. Results are discussed and directions for further research and theoretical refinement are offered. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Runaway is a status offense for which there is concern that youths, particularly girls, are vulnerable to the 'evils of the streets.' Prior research suggests that many personal and family risks of runaway are gendered, that the streets may be meaner, and that the strategies for survival disproportionately serve to criminalize girls. Moreover, patriarchial values may make the juvenile justice response to runaway girls overly harsh 'for their own good.' Unfortunately, research has been hampered by small or biased samples. This study examines many risk factors to discern patterns and gender differences among runaway youths for whom there is a status offense charged. Many charged runaway youths are followed to determine the nature of official responses and whether responses appear gendered. The findings have implications for changes in how officials respond to runaway youths, both in terms of what will better serve the youths' best interests and for improving public safety.

AB  - There have been only a limited number of studies that examine drug use among homeless youth and there have been no studies to date on drug use with adolescents living in homeless families. This study examined predictors of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use with homeless adolescents and preadolescents (N = 234) living in shelters for homeless families. Structured interviews were conducted on self-reported drug use, as well as background variables, social environmental influences, and individual characteristics hypothesized to promote drug use. Logistic-regression analyses revealed that social influences (friends and family drug use) are strong predictors of experimental drug use and intentions to use drugs, as are several psychological factors (psychological well-being, assertiveness, and social support). Implications of the findings for effective prevention programs for homeless and other high risk youth are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This pilot study explores issues of culture and alcohol and other drug use in relation to substance abuse prevention with high-risk youth, with a particular interest in Latinos/as and acculturation. Many of the prominent prevention studies are school based, missing some of the youth at very highest risk for alcohol and drug use and abuse. Consequently, this study was conducted in community settings with youth from high-risk neighborhoods and environmental conditions, including a homeless youth shelter, an alternative learning setting, and a low-income community program. The data indicated a high lifetime prevalence of drug use (over 80% for Whites and Latinos for beer, wine, liquor, and marijuana), with consistently lower prevalence rates observed among African Americans. In addition, the study found significant ethnic differences in substance use (last 30 days) in the sample (median age = 16), with African Americans reporting significantly lower incidence of marijuana and cocaine use (p < .05) than other youth. Implications for prevention, intervention, and future research are discussed.

AB  - This study examines the current applicability and appropriateness of services for female juvenile offenders in Texas. Specifically, it addresses several facets of female services (including need levels, provision, effectiveness and accessibility) across a wide variety of categories (including emotional and physical health, behavioral problems, and self-enhancement needs). In 2001, surveys assessing these areas were completed by 123 departments within the Texas Youth Commission. Overall, juvenile probation departments across the state serve females with varying needs; however, their provision of service is almost always inadequate compared to need levels. In the emotional health category, chemical dependency and mental health needs are most prevalent. Levels of physical health needs are slightly lower than the emotional need levels. Chronic runaway and truancy are the most prevalent needs in the behavioral category. Finally, self-enhancement needs appear to be the most prevalent of any need category. In addition, the majority of respondents believe that their current services are adequate, and that no difference in accessibility of these services for females or males exists. It is clear, however, that some needs, such as female mentoring and vocational training, have not been met by present services offered.

AB  - This article addresses controversy over gender differences in risk and protective factors for late-adolescence assaults. A secondary analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort considered 2,552 youth aged 12 or 13 in the first survey wave. Comparison of girls and boys revealed, as expected, boys had higher levels of risk factors: early delinquency, gang involvement, and hopelessness. Girls were higher in the protective factors, parental monitoring, and school and religious ties; but boys were higher in parental support and work involvement. Negative binomial regression showed that gang exposure and hopelessness explained assaults, regardless of gender. For girls, early runaway behavior and work activity were positively, and parental monitoring was negatively, related to assaults. Unexpectedly, boys with high parental support were more assaultive than others. Prevention requires addressing negative contexts for all youth, but for girls, programs also must address conditions promoting their running away. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In a survey of 500 admissions to a short-term residential chemical dependency treatment center for adolescents (ages 12 to 18), 150 adolescents (30%) had been identified as victims of physical and/or sexual abuse. While the abused group had a higher incidence of prior social service and mental health intervention, extraordinarily 68% of these abuse cases had not been reported by children, family, or interviewers prior to the adolescents having entered the chemical dependency residential treatment facility. This chemically dependent, previously abused group was differentiated from a comparison group of nonabused, chemically dependent adolescents, and a second comparison group of nonabused, nonchemically dependent adolescents. Results indicated a higher incidence of acting out behavior, runaways, legal involvement and sexual promiscuity within the abused group. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Recreational cocaine use spread rapidly in Amsterdam at the end of the 1970s, particularly as a "party drug" in clubs and discotheques. At the end of the 1980s, the role of cocaine as party drug was largely taken over by ecstasy. In contrast, first cocaine and then crack cocaine increased in popularity among heroin addicts and marginalized street youth, including homeless youth and young prostitutes. Today, experimental use of crack is also observed among young people from socially deprived neighborhoods, especially among ethnic minorities. This article describes, mainly on the basis of ethnographic studies among these groups, the evolving and diverging patterns of use among trendsetting party youth and their marginalized counterparts. Important differences may be observed between groups related to socio-economic background, the role cocaine plays in their lives, transmission routes, and different operating market mechanisms influenced by drug policy. For party youth, cocaine use mainly serves recreational purposes. In contrast, for problem youth, cocaine, and now especially crack, contribute to multi-problem behavior within the context of their marginalized lifestyles. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This report describes the development of measures of AIDS knowledge and beliefs about AIDS prevention for adolescents. Review of the literature, focus groups, pilot testing, and reviews by advisory councils assured that the process of developing the measures contributed to their validity. These measures were administered to three samples of adolescents at high risk for contracting AIDS: 43 runaway males, 43 runaway females, and 36 self-identified gay males. Both the knowledge and the beliefs instruments showed moderately high internal consistency and test-retest reliability and successfully avoided ceiling effects. Gay males demonstrated significantly greater knowledge of AIDS; however, there were few differences in beliefs among the groups. Knowledge of AIDS was significantly correlated with beliefs about AIDS prevention. The results suggest that these measures identify gaps in knowledge and beliefs among high-risk youth.

AB  - Abstract: This study examines the impact of early abuse on the functioning and the 12-month treatment outcomes of 146 homeless addicted women who entered residential substance abuse treatment. Sixty-nine percent of the women reported exposure to childhood physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; the majority reported multiple forms of abuse. Comparisons of abused and nonabused women revealed significant differences in childhood, adolescent, and adult functioning, indicative of the pervasive detrimental effects of early abuse. Female survivors of childhood abuse did not improve in treatment as much as their nonabused peers in psychological functioning (p < .001), substance abuse (p < .01), or continuing trauma exposure (p < .01) .The findings suggest the importance of adapting models of residential substance abuse treatment to address concurrent issues related to trauma history. Additional research is needed to identify effective integrated treatment approaches for this population and to explore the independent and interconnected pathways linking trauma history and outcome.

AB  - An increase in the use of cocaine and crack in several parts of Europe has raised the question whether this trend is similar to that of the USA in the 1980s. However, research in the field of cocaine use in Europe has been only sporadic. Therefore, a European multi-centre and multi-modal project was designed to study specific aspects of cocaine and crack use in Europe, in order to develop guidelines for public health strategies. Data on prevalence rates were analysed for the general population and for specific subgroups. Despite large differences between countries in the prevalence of cocaine use in the general population, most countries show an increase in the last few years. The highest rate with a lifetime prevalence of 5.2% was found for the United Kingdom, although with a plateau effect around the year 2000. With regard to specific subgroups, three groups seem to show a higher prevalence than the general population: (1) youth, especially in the party scene; (2) socially marginalized groups, such as homeless and prostitutes or those found in open drug scenes; (3) opiate-dependent patients in maintenance treatment who additionally use cocaine. Specific strategies need to be developed to address problematic cocaine use in these subgroups. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A chart review and telephone interview of 72 sexual abuse victims was conducted to determine if children and adolescents who are victims of sexual abuse suffer from symptoms similar to the ‘rape trauma syndrome,’ which has been reported in adults. Symptoms similar to the rape trauma syndrome were found in 48 of the 72 abused children and only 26 of the matched control group, p < .01. Common somatic complaints in the sexual abuse patients included dysuria, vaginal discharge and chronic abdominal pain. Some of the emotional and behavioral problems noted during the follow-up period among the sexual abuse patients included sleep problems, runaway behavior, and suicide attempts. The duration of abuse and age of the victim at the time of abuse significantly affected the frequency of reported somatic symptoms, but the type of abuse and type of assailant did not significantly affect the frequency of reported somatic and emotional reactions. There was no difference in the occurrence of school problems and early pregnancy between sexually abused patients and controls. Since 67% of all sexually abused patients suffered from emotional and somatic reactions, close follow-up of these patients is indicated. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study examines the interrelationship among childhood victimization, running away, and delinquency, and whether running away serves to mediate or moderate this relationship. Data are from a prospective cohorts design study in which documented cases of childhood abuse and neglect were compared to matched controls, and followed-up and interviewed between 1989 and 1995. Results indicate that being abused or neglected in childhood increases the likelihood that a youth will run away from home, both childhood victimization and running away increase the risk of juvenile arrest, and chronic runaways were at greater risk of arrest as juveniles. Furthermore, running away does not mediate the relationship between childhood victimization and delinquency, because running away increases the risk of juvenile arrest for both childhood victims and nonvictims. The effect of running away is stronger for nonabused and nonneglected youths than for abused and neglected children. Implications of these findings for research and policy are discussed.

AB  - Studies investigating homeless women's experiences of violence date to the mid 1980's, but much of it has been more concerned with establishing the fact of violence committed against these extremely vulnerable women than in exploring the factors associated with it. This multi-site statewide study examined the experience of violence among 800 homeless women living in one of four cities in Florida. One of the most consistent risk factors for victimization is youth, yet the women in this sample became homeless, for the most part, in their early thirties. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to study the characteristics and victimization experiences of two groups of women, those women who became homeless before age 32 and those who became homeless after age 33, to determine significant differences in their life experiences that might explain what led some to become homeless later than others. Preliminary results show distinct differences between the two groups. Women who first became homeless at a younger age were more likely to be single, experienced childhood abuse, have lower self esteem, and lower education attainment compared to women who first became homeless at an older age. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Juvenile prostitution has historically been considered both a victimization and criminal behavior. This study explored the relationships between substance abuse, race and family dynamics within a sample of 149 female juvenile prostitutes arrested in a southern state over a 4.5 year period from 2001 to 2005. The information analyzed includes the Massachusetts Youth Screening Inventory, Second Version (Grisso & Barnum, 2000), a Supervision Risk Classification Instrument, criminal justice data from a statewide database and narratives about the arresting offense and psychosocial data completed by juvenile probation officers. The study defined family dynamics as the extent of parental supervision, parental incarceration, change in custodian, and runaway status. The present study also explored the differences between peer relationships and the histories of abuse and neglect among white and non-white female juvenile prostitutes. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Substantial gender differences in the prevalence and frequency of juvenile offending exist for most forms of delinquency.  Running away is an exception.  This paper explores the connection between gender and runaway behavior, applying the framework of general strain theory.  Data are drawn from two waves of the Add Health survey.  The connection between running away and strains emanating from multiple domains is examined in separate models for boys and girls.  The mediating effects of personal coping resources and social sources of support, which are to some degree gender-typed, are also explored.  Implications for future research and policy are discussed. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Social learning models offer one explanation for the relationship between parental violence and delinquency. These accounts suggest that children and youth learn from their parents that violence is an appropriate means to solve problems, address conflict, and achieve goals. We suggest that other, complimentary learning process also occur when children are exposed to parental violence. In this analysis, we focus on perceptions of danger. Fear of physical pain is a primary component of evaluations of dangerousness. We hypothesize that abused children learn that they can tolerate and heal from physical pain. As a result, they devalue one of the common costs associated with offending and aggressive behavior: the possibility of physical pain. In other words, compared to other youth, abused children are less likely to believe that they will be physically harmed if they engage in criminal and violent actions. Preliminary findings from a sample of homeless youth reveal significant relationships between parental physical abuse, evaluations of dangerousness and offending. Initial results also highlight important differences between males and females in these relationships. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Research has shown that homelessness has a facilitation effect on delinquency. Yet although homelessness is a significant social problem with detrimental risks for all adolescents, current understandings of youth homelessness have largely ignored the impact of gender on street experiences. This study uses both qualitative and quantitative methods to explore homeless young women's perceptions of crime, and their involvement in, and attachment to, delinquent activities. This paper also highlights differences among homeless females based on age, race/ethnicity, and whether or not they are pregnant or parenting. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Previous research on homeless adolescents has largely ignored the distinction between those who have left home on their own volition (runaways), and those who have been forced to leave (throwaways). Fifty-two homeless adolescents in Brisbane, Australia, were assessed to compare male and female runaways and throwaways for social adjustment and symptomatology. Differences for social adjustment (antisocial tendencies and aggression) and symptomatology (social isolation and depression) were predicted. Results indicated that male runaways were significantly more hostile than male throwaways (p less than .001), and significantly more socially isolated than female runaways (p less than .025). Female throwaways, however, were significantly more hostile than male throwaways (p less than .025) and female runaways (p less than .025). Yet homeless males overall had a significantly stronger urge to act out hostility than homeless females (p less than .025). In addition, female throwaways were significantly more antisocial than male throwaways (p less than .001). There were no significant differences for depression. A theory of inner social control (Hirschi, 1969), postulating absence of bonding in earlier socialization, was supported. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In his Control Balance Theory Charles Tittle argues that under favorable conditions  unbalanced control ratios will lead to different forms of deviance. The type of deviance chosen is argued to depend on the degree and direction of the imbalance and the desirability the offense presents as a method of altering the control imbalance. Utilizing a sample of homeless street youth this paper examines if different types of control balance ratios are associated with different forms of drug use. In particular, the paper explores if there is a difference in the types of control balance ratios associated with soft drug use in comparison to those ratios associated with harder street drugs. In addition, the paper examines types of control balance ratios operating across a range of hard drugs. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study examines developmental sequences of girls' delinquency through the use of replicated analyses across two longitudinal studies.  The Denver Youth Study (DYS) is based on an accelerated, longitudinal design of 5 birth cohorts from a probability sample of households in high risk n eighborhoods.  Fast Track (FT) is a multi-site longitudinal investigation of the development and prevention of children's conduct problems.  The participants were selected from high-risk schools that were randomly assigned to either the control or intervention condition; data are from the high-risk control and the normative samples.   Near identical versions of self reports of 7 delinquency types (runaway,  other status, disorderly conduct, minor property, serious assault, serious property, drug sales) were derived across the two samples of girls (N's: DYS-721; FT-317).  Findings indicate that a sizeable proportion of girls in both samples reported engaging in some type of delinquent activity (DYS: 87%; FT: 73%).  Although the preponderance of these behaviors were minor, a sizeable minority of girls also engaged in serious property (DYS - 29%; FT - 16%), serious assault (DYS:  31%; FT-12%), and drug sales (DYS-14%; FT-6%) behaviors.  Overall, the findings suggest diverse patterns of delinquent activity among girls.  Additional analyses will examine the sequencing of delinquency behaviors across developmental periods. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study investigated whether runaway behavior could be related to six problematic areas. Selected scales of the Personality Inventory for Children, representative of the six areas, were hypothesized to discriminate between an adolescent runaway group and a control group. Four scales correctly classified 95.1% of the runaway subjects and 100% of the control subjects with a total correct classification rate of 97.52%. It was further hypothesized that the runaway group was not significantly different from a known clinical group with moderate to severe psychopathology. Results indicated that the runaway group was not significantly different except on one scale, Delinquency (DLQ). On the DLQ scale the runaway group had a significantly higher mean score than the clinical group. Application and recommendations are presented. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
