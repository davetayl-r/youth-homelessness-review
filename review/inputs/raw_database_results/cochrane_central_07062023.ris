N2  - Objective: Limited research exists on how employment interventions contribute to employment outcomes for homeless youth. This study examines the comparative efficacy of 2 interventions-Social Enterprise Intervention (SEI) and Individual Placement and Support (IPS)-provided to homeless youth with mental illness in a randomized controlled trial. Method: Participants were recruited from 1 homeless youth agency in Los Angeles, CA, and randomized to the SEI (n = 36) or IPS (n = 36) conditions. Over 20 months, SEI participants received 4 SEI components, and IPS participants received IPS services based on 8 principles. Data were collected at baseline and follow-up for the primary employment outcome (paid employment) and 5 secondary employment outcomes. Results: Over 20 months, 39% of SEI participants and 32% of IPS participants reported any paid employment. Across both groups, participants who reported working at baseline had nearly 8 times the odds of working at follow-up (OR = 7.91, p < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were detected across the full sample or between groups on the primary or secondary employment outcomes. Conclusions: Future effectiveness research is needed to compare the long-term employment outcomes of the SEI and IPS with a more heterogeneous sample of homeless youth using customized homelessness support services and more nuanced employment outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although the risk factors associated with young people entering and becoming entrenched in street life have been thoroughly investigated, peer-reviewed evidence is scarce to nonexistent for rigorous interventions targeting social integration outcomes for young people who have experienced homelessness. From the limited research that has been done, emerging evidence signals that, although structural supports such as subsidized housing and social service providers are important, these resources alone are insufficient to help young people integrate into the mainstream society., OBJECTIVE: The overarching aim of this study is to assess whether and how rent subsidies and mentorship influence social integration outcomes for formerly homeless young people living in market rent housing in 3 Canadian cities. The primary outcome measures for this study are community integration (psychological and physical) and self-esteem at 18 months. Secondary outcomes include social connectedness, hope, and academic and vocational participation at 18 months. Exploratory outcomes include income, perceived housing quality, engulfment, psychiatric symptoms, and participant perspectives of intervention barriers and facilitators., METHODS: This is a convergent mixed methods, open-label, 2-arm parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 1:1 allocation embedded within a community-based participatory action research (CBPAR) framework. The intervention will provide 24 young people (aged 16-26 years), who have transitioned out of homelessness and into market rent housing within the past year, with rent subsidies for 24 months. Half of the young people will also be randomly assigned an adult mentor who has been recruited and screened by 1 of our 3 community partners. Data collection will occur every 6 months, and participants will be followed for 30 months., RESULTS: Ethical approval for this study has been obtained from the Providence, St Joseph's, and St Michael's Healthcare Research Ethics Board (number 18-251). Enrollment took place from April 2019 to September 2019. Preliminary analysis of the baseline quantitative and qualitative data is underway., CONCLUSIONS: This pilot RCT will be the first to test the impact of economic and social support on meaningful social integration for formerly homeless young people living in market rent housing. We believe that the mixed methods design will illuminate important contextual factors that must be considered if the intervention is to be scaled up and replicated elsewhere. Importantly, the CBPAR framework will incorporate the perspectives of the community, including formerly homeless young people, who are in the best position to determine what might work best in the context of their lives., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03779204; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03779204., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/15557.

T1  - Transitioning Youth Out of Homelessness 2.0 (TYOH 2.0)
T2  - Transitioning Youth Out of Homelessness 2.0: a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of a Rent Subsidy and Identity Capital Intervention for Youth Exiting Homelessness
Y1  - 2023//
Y2  - 2023//
N2  - Introduction: This 12-month pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) builds on previous, community-engaged work and explores whether portable rent subsidies and an intervention, targeting identity capital (purpose, control, self-efficacy, and self-esteem) hold promise as, a way to facilitate socioeconomic inclusion for youth (age 16 - 24 years) exiting, homelessness and living in market rent housing in Ontario, Canada. All (n = 40) participants, will receive rent subsidies; half will be randomly assigned an identity capital intervention, (co-designed leadership guide + coach)., Methods and analysis: This study will employ a convergent mixed methods, two-arm parallel, RCT, open-label design with 1:1 allocation embedded within a Community Based Participatory, Action Research framework and underpinned by Critical Social Theory., Specifically, the objectives and measures are:, 1. Primary - examine whether targeted economic and identity-based supports are a feasible, and acceptable way to foster socioeconomic inclusion. Measures:, recruitment/enrolment/dropout metrics; self-report composite checklists regarding, intervention engagement; qualitative focus groups., 2. Secondary - assess differences between targeted economic and identity-based supports, (intervention group) and economic supports only (control group) at the 12-month primary, endpoint with respect to self-reported socioeconomic inclusion measures of: 1), education, employment and training (EET); 2) housing security; and 3) identity capital., Measures: self-report composite EET checklist; self-report measures of housing security, and identity capital., 3. Exploratory - explore whether variables at baseline (e.g., participant demographics such, as gender or global assessment of individual needs [GAIN]) suggest the intervention may, be more feasible and acceptable for certain groups of young people. Measures: select, variables from the baseline demographic; GAIN-Short Screener questionnaires for those in, the intervention group., Ethics and dissemination: This study received ethical approval from the Unity Health Toronto, Research Ethics Board. The investigators will continue working alongside community partners -, including youth with lived expertise - to disseminate findings broadly and in diverse,  formats.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Transgender youth demonstrate significantly higher rates of engagement in sexual risk behaviors relative to their cisgender or gender-conforming counterparts, including high rates of condomless anal intercourse and engagement in sex work. In addition, transgender youth experience increased physical or sexual abuse, victimization, substance use, mental health disorders, incarceration, and homelessness. Owing to these syndemic health disparities, transgender youth are at substantially increased risk of HIV infection., OBJECTIVE: This protocol aims to describe a randomized controlled trial (RCT), Adolescent Medicine Trials Network 160 TechStep (N=250), which assesses the differential immediate and sustained effects of each of 3 conditions (text messaging, WebApp, or information-only control) for reducing sexual risk behaviors and increasing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake among high-risk, HIV-negative transgender youth and young adults (aged 15-24 years)., METHODS: Participants will be recruited through web-based (targeted social media sites and apps) and offline (print ads and flyers) advertisements, peer and clinic referrals, and street- and venue-based outreach, and by contacting potential participants who have requested contact for future studies. Participants will be randomized into 1 of the 3 conditions: (1) text messaging, (2) WebApp, or (3) information-only control for 6 months. Assessments will occur at baseline and at 3, 6, and 9 months. Participants who do not show improvements in sexual risk or PrEP uptake at the 3-month assessment will be rerandomized to receive weekly electronic coaching (eCoaching) sessions in addition to their assigned text messaging or WebApp intervention, or remain in the original text messaging or WebApp intervention using a 2:1 ratio. Participants originally assigned to the information-only condition are not eligible for rerandomization., RESULTS: Funding for TechStep was awarded in June 2017. Phase 1 was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) in April 2018. Recruitment began in November 2018 for phase 1, the formative phase. Initial phase 2 IRB approval came in June 2019. The data collection for phase 2, the RCT, is expected to be completed in April 2021. As of March 2020, 54 participants have been enrolled in TechStep. The final results are anticipated in May 2021., CONCLUSIONS: By providing culturally responsive, technology-based interventions, TechStep aims to improve sexual health outcomes among HIV-negative transgender youth and young adults at high risk of HIV. TechStep will evaluate the efficacy of technology-based interventions for reducing HIV sexual risk behaviors and increasing PrEP initiation, adherence, and persistence. The suite of technology-based interventions developed in TechStep, and assessed for efficacy in a 3-condition RCT, represents an important advancement in intervention science toward developing tailored and scalable interventions for transgender youth and young adults., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04000724; http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04000724., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/18326.

T1  - Improving outcomes for older youth adopted from foster care
A1  - Miranda J
Y1  - 2017//
Y2  - 2017//
N2  - Objectives: There are increasing efforts to adopt older youth from foster care, given that youth who &ldquo;age out&rdquo; of the foster care system are at increased risk for homelessness, incarceration, and poor academic outcomes, yet research demonstrates that older foster care youth often have histories of trauma, substance exposure in utero, and risk of multiple placements, which can affect behavioral and adoption outcomes. Furthermore, there are few evidence-based interventions designed for families adopting older youth from foster care. The goal of this presentation is to describe a unique manualized Adoption-Specific Intervention (ADAPT) intervention, developed specifically for families adopting older foster care youth. Important lessons for mental health clinicians working with families of adopted youth will be discussed. Methods: We present early results from a small open and recently initiated the randomized trial of ADAPT versus care as usual for older children (ages 5-16 years) adopted from the foster care system. Outcomes include child symptomatology, parent stress, and progress on parent-defined behavioral goals. Results: Early results show that children assigned to the ADAPT intervention improve in terms of symptomatology and parent-defined behavioral goals. Parental stress does not appear to improve following the intervention. Implications of this intervention and early findings will be provided for clinicians working with this population in the community. Conclusions: The ADAPT intervention holds promise for improving outcomes for older children adopted from foster care.

N2  - Purpose: Homeless youths are vulnerable to multiple poor health outcomes owing to substance use and risky sexual behaviors, thus we need to develop and test interventions that assist them in attaining health-promoting skills and habits. These youths are difficult to engage in formalized interventions because they tend to avoid interacting with authorities and they are highly mobile. The purpose of this analysis was to determine if demographic factors differentiated those who became engaged and completed all phases of a randomized intervention study and those who did not. Methods: This analysis is from an ongoing multi-site longitudinal in-tervention study using a rigorous Solomon four-group design. Youths were enrolled in the study after providing written, informed consent and being screened for current substance use treatment. Each par-ticipant was randomly assigned to one of four groups: intervention or control with pre-tests or intervention or control without pretests. Those assigned to the intervention condition received 6 individualized sessions with a facilitator whereas those assigned to the control condition received services as usual at the recruitment facility. Post-tests were scheduled immediately following the sixth session of the intervention and 3 and 6 months thereafter. For this analysis, we compared those who were randomly assigned to the in-tervention condition (with or without pre-test) and completed all six sessions and all post-tests (i.e., compliant), with those who did not complete all sessions nor all post-tests (noncompliant). Results: Male and female participants ranged in age from 18-23 and there were no significant age or sex differences between the compliant and noncompliant groups on sex or age, but there was a significant difference by race/ethnicity (&khgr;2 (9) = 20.34, p =.016) with more Whites in the noncompliant group and more Black and Hispanic in the compliant group. There were significant differences between the compliant and noncompliant groups by school enrollment (&khgr;2 (3) = 7.84, p =.049) and by homelessness owing to parent or guardian's death (&khgr;2 (3) = 10.56, p =.014). Those who were currently enrolled in school or who were homeless owing to a parent's or guardian's death were more likely to be noncompliant. There were no significant differences in the two groups in terms of their primary living arrangements in the past year, sources of earning money in the past six months, having a history of sexual abuse, having been tested for HIV, or for having ever been treated for alcohol or drug abuse. Conclusions: Youths who stayed and completed the study and follow-up were more likely to be youths of color, not enrolled in school, and not homeless owing to a parent or guardian's death. Non-significant findings regarding all other demographic variables suggest that this intervention may appeal to a wide variety of homeless youths. Further study is warranted to determine what other factors might account for those who were not able to complete the study and the follow-up measures. Sources of Support: None.

N2  - Purpose: To test video games designed to raise awareness of link between weekly marijuana use among youth and psychosis. The Back to Reality Series (the Series trailer https://vimeo.com/140117271)) represents integrated knowledge translation (iKT) products. The Series was inspired by cannabis research and created by an iKT community of youth, youth with lived experiences, clinicians, researchers, and game designers. Methods: Fifty-five homeless and street-involved youth were interviewed after being randomly assigned in an open trial to play the Series versus a control game. Knowledge about marijuana use, harms, and psychosis was assessed using a quiz- the Psychosis Cannabis Test (PCT). Feedback was qualitatively analyzed for themes regarding gameplay and marijuana use. Results: The mean age for the whole sample was 17. 5 (SD = 1.1) with 55% male, 9% gender fluid, and 36% female. Up to 24 % of respondents endorsed past experiences suggestive of psychotic symptoms. The mean PCT score was 5.5 (SD = 1.9) for the 25 participants who played the control game and 6.8 (SD = 1.6) for the 31 participants randomly assigned to the Series. The Series group obtained significantly greater scores (p< .05) on the PCT compared to the control group, indicating greater knowledge of the risks and harms. Most youth (90%) enjoyed playing the Series versus 75% for the control game. Youth believed the Series was educational and felt they could relate to the protagonist's experiences. Conclusion: Pilot data provide preliminary evidence that interactive video games can educate youth about the harms associated with marijuana use.

N2  - Research on pathways to care has consistently found delays in access to early intervention services. Youth do not know how to detect psychosis, and they do not know where to seek help. The Back to Reality series are video games designed to translate research messages about early signs of psychosis. The aim was to improve early detection of psychosis by youth, using arts-based research methods to create these knowledge translation products. Methods: Through an iterative and collaborative process involving the artists (game designers), researchers, and knowledge users, the inferences were drawn from pathways to care research were adapted and synthesized to inspire the creation of the games. Qualitatively analyzed data from individual interviews (20 first episode psychosis plus 4 family members) and focus groups (5 primary care providers plus 5 substance using youth) identified concepts and themes about gameplay and illness experiences. Results: The series depicts psychosis and cannabis use in a manner that resonated with participants. Participants talked about ways of adapting the video games for the target audiences. Schools and primary care providers were seen as appropriate institutions for disseminating the video games to youth. Conclusion: Arts-based research methods and gaming technology can advance youth understanding of psychosis and pathways to care. Future projects include evaluating the effectiveness of the video games at improving the mental health literacy of homeless and street-involved youth, using a randomized control design.

N2  - Homeless young adults are more likely than their never-homeless counterparts to abuse substances and engage in sexual risk behaviors, yet no brief interventions to simultaneously reduce these behaviors among this vulnerable population have been systematically designed and evaluated. This study evaluated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a smartphone application to self-monitor substance use and sexual risk behaviors plus a briefmotivational intervention (BMI) in reducing substance use and sexual risk behaviors among homeless young adults. A randomized pilot trial (N = 60) compared the smartphone application plus BMI to treatment as usual (TAU) at an inner-city crisis shelter for homeless young adults (18 to 21 years). Participants were assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks after baseline to evaluate alcohol consumption, marijuana use, sexual risk behaviors, and other relevant variables. Kruskal-Wallis tests, which account for the non-normal distribution of data, were performed to determine differences between baseline and postintervention assessments for the entire sample and by condition. Participants in the smartphone application plus BMI condition significantly reduced their past 2-week number of drinks (p = 0.023), times used marijuana (p = 0.046), times engaged in unprotected sex (p = 0.012), and times used drugs before sexual activity (p = 0.019) between baseline and post-intervention. No reductions of substance use or sexual risk behaviors were found among participants in the TAU condition (all ps>0.05). Findings from participant evaluations, collected at post-assessment, revealed that participants were highly satisfied with the overall quality, approach, and content of the smartphone application plus BMI. Though from a small sample, findings suggest that the smartphone application plus BMI is feasible and effective in reducing participant past 2-week substance use and sexual risk behaviors. Even if the smartphone application plus BMI proves to be somewhat less effective in terms of long-term behavior change than lengthy, more intensive approaches, the increased coverage fromease of dissemination, particularly with high risk individuals who are difficult to locate and retain, may eventually result in a larger overall public health effect.

N2  - Purpose: High rates of substance use and sexual risk behavior among young adults experiencing homelessness speak to the need for effective risk reduction programs for this vulnerable population. Yet individuals experiencing homelessness can be challenging to engage in services and retain over time in intervention studies. We present results from a pilot cluster cross-over randomized controlled trial of AWARE, a brief four-session group-based motivational interviewing (MI) intervention focused on both substance use and sexual risk behavior. We also discuss an ongoing trial to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of AWARE, including strategies being employed to engage and retain homeless young adults in the program and research study. Methods/Data: For the pilot study, 200 homeless young adults ages 18-25 (mean age = 21.8) received the AWARE program (n = 100) or usual care control (n = 100) at one of two drop-in centers. The sample was 73%male, 79%heterosexual, and 31%non-Hispanic white. Surveys were completed at baseline and three months after programcompletion. The current trial involves conducting 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Results: AWARE participants in the pilot study self-reported positive change in their past 3 month and past 30 day alcohol use (ps &les; 0.05), motivation to change drug use (ps < 0.05), and condom use self-efficacy (p = 0.05) compared to the control group. Among those withmultiple sex partners, AWARE participants showed a decrease in unprotected sexual events (p < 0.05), whereas the control group did not. Strategies that are currently being used in the larger evaluation to engage homeless young adults in the program, encourage program completion, and track and resurvey the sample over a 12-month are presented. Conclusions: Pilot esults suggest that a brief group-MI risk reduction intervention can be effective in helping homeless young adultsmake positive short-termchanges in their alcohol and condom use. However, evaluating the longer-term outcomes of AWARE requires innovative strategies to successfully engage, track, and retain homeless young adults over time. The strategies presented can help inform other efforts to engage homeless youth in clinical trials, as well as behavioral health services more generally.

T1  - 13.2 SMARTPHONE AND TABLET INTERVENTIONS FOR UNDERSERVED AND AT-RISK YOUTH
A1  - Karnik NS
Y1  - 2019//
Y2  - 2019//
N2  - Objectives: The goal of this session is to present results from 2 research studies that use digital health tools for underserved and at-risk youth. Methods: Both studies use community-based research settings in Chicago. One study uses a randomized control design to examine the impact of a tablet-based screening and brief motivational interviewing intervention for young men who have sex with men and young transgender women (N = 410) seeking HIV testing. In this study, the sample group is 90 percent cis-male, 10 percent transgender, 61 percent gay, 24 percent bisexual, 10 percent queer, 3 percent straight, 30 percent non-Hispanic white, 37 percent non-Hispanic black, 25 percent Hispanic/Latinx, and 8 percent other. The second study examines the feasibility of using smartphones and a suite of preloaded coaching and mental health apps to engage homeless youth (N = 65). In this study, the sample group is 50 percent cis-female, 45 percent cis-male, 5 percent transgender, 50 percent non-Hispanic black, 23 percent other, 20 percent Hispanic/Latinx, and 9 percent non-Hispanic white. Results: Youth showed high engagement with both modalities. Youth preferred brief interventions, such as surveys and tips, and expressed that interventions with flexibility for completion were preferable to more standard interventions. Youth exposed to the brief motivational interviewing intervention showed reductions in binge episodes and the number of drinks of alcohol. Youth using the smartphone suite did not show significant clinical change over the course of the study. Conclusions: Further research is warranted on the use of digital health interventions of youth. Despite high engagement and retention, interventions probably need to be modified to fit these new and emerging modalities. The use of chatbots and other automated designs have the potential to reach youth in real time for help and support, especially when traditional systems of care are less available or limited.

N2  - Homeless youth have extremely high rates of suicidal ideation and attempts, but limited research has evaluated the efficacy of suicide prevention interventions. Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) between the ages of 18 to 24 years were recruited from a local drop-in center. Of interest was (1) whether the proposed sample of eligible youth could be identified, (2) whether youth could be engaged and retained in the prevention intervention, and (3) whether the intervention was associated with reduced suicidal ideation, our primary outcome measure. In particular, youth were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) (N = 75) or TAU alone (N = 75). Findings showed that the proposed sample of eligible youth could be identified and engaged in the study, and all youth showed a significant decline in suicidal ideation over time, with a faster decline among youth assigned to CTSP. These findings suggest that (1) at-risk suicidal youth can be identified and engaged outside of hospital emergency rooms, such as in drop-in centers, and (2) intervention added to TAU can strengthen reductions in suicidal ideation. Ultimately, attention towards reducing suicide risk among these youth has the potential to reduce premature mortality, hospitalization and loss of human capital.

N2  - Homeless young adults are more likely than their never-homeless counterparts to abuse substances and engage in sexual risk behaviors. This study evaluated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of OnTrack, a smartphone application to self-monitor substance use and sexual risk behaviors, plus a brief motivational intervention (BMI), in reducing substance use and sexual risk among homeless young adults. A randomized controlled pilot trial (N = 60) compared OnTrack + BMI to treatment as usual (TAU) at an inner-city crisis shelter for homeless young adults (aged 18-21 years). Participants were assessed at baseline and 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks after baseline to evaluate substance use and sexual risk behaviors. Kruskal-Wallis tests determined differences between baseline and postintervention assessments. Logistic regression models examined treatment effect on change in outcomes between baseline and postintervention follow-up assessment, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in OnTrack + BMI significantly reduced past 2-week number of drinks (p = .023), times used marijuana (p = .046), times engaged in unprotected sex (p = .012), and times used drugs before sexual activity (p = .019). No reductions of substance use or sexual risk behaviors were found among participants in TAU (all ps > .05). After adjusting for baseline levels of substance use and sexual risk, participants in OnTrack + BMI had significantly lower odds than those in TAU for drinking alcohol (adjusted OR = 0.14; p = .01) and having unprotected sex (adjusted OR = 0.151; p = .032). OnTrack + BMI is feasible and effective in reducing past 2-week alcohol use and unprotected sex among homeless young adults. A larger randomized trial is warranted to replicate and extend present results. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

N2  - Introduction: Recent evidence shows an increase in alcohol-related emergency department (ED) visits among youth. We sought to quantify the impact of ED visits (type and frequency, patient characteristics and resource use) related to alcohol in our centre. Methods: This was a chart review of patients aged 12-24 with alcohol-related ED visits between Sept 2013-Aug 2017. The National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) database was searched for visits alcohol related ICD-10 codes. The Canadian Hospital Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) database was also searched using the keyword alcohol. Duplicate visits were removed. Visits were excluded if patients had a history of psychosis, were held in the ED for psychiatric assessment, were homeless, were inmates from a correctional institute, if alcohol use was not mentioned and for complaints of sexual assault/intimate partner violence. Data was abstracted by two reviewers using a standard form with predetermined variables. Differences were resolved with third party adjudication. Interrater reliability of the reviewers was assessed with Kappa scores through duplicate review of 10% of randomly selected charts. A further 10% were assessed by a 3rd reviewer for extraction accuracy. Results: 3, 256 ED visits were identified with 777 removed via predefined exclusion criteria. 2, 479 visits were reviewed with a male predominance (54.3%). More than half of all patients (50.9%) arrived via ambulance. Assigned CTAS levels were Resuscitation: 1% Emergent: 9.9% Urgent: 48.2% Less Urgent: 35.7% Non-Urgent: 4.2% (missing 1%). The median LOS was 2.9 hrs (IQR 1.8-4.6). All visits were sub-classified into mutually exclusive categories: injury (51.8%), acute intoxication (45.1%) and mental health issue (3.2%). Males were more likely to present with injury (62.4% vs 42.6%, p < 0.01). Females were more likely to present with acute intoxication (53.3% vs 46.7%, p <0.01) and mental health issues (59.5% vs 40.5%, P = 0.01). ED resource use was notable: 483 (19.4%) had imaging tests and 1216 (49.1%) had some medical intervention (blood test, fluids or medication). 57 (2.3%) patients were admitted and there was one death from an alcohol related MVC. Conclusion: Alcohol-related ED visits by youth are common in our centre and utilize substantial prehospital and in-hospital resources. Identification of effective harm reduction strategies should be a research priority.

N2  - Background: Homelessness among youth is devastating, with high rates of substance use disorders and mental health comorbidity. Mindfulness-based interventions that include meditation and mindfulness skills training reduce stress and symptoms of anxiety or depression. However, engaging high-risk youth in interventions is challenging. Virtual reality is a more flexible platform for delivering meditation and may be appealing to youth. Objective: The study objectives were to evaluate the feasibility of delivering virtual reality meditation and of collecting outcome measures, including anxiety and physiologic stress. Methods: A sample of 30 youth experiencing homelessness was enrolled in the study. Youth were randomized to receive 10 minutes of one of three interventions: (1) virtual reality meditation, (2) audio meditation (through a web-based platform), or (3) virtual reality imagery of historical pictures and text. Subjects who consented to the study attended two research visits. The first visit collected survey measures of demographics, mental health, and substance use, and oriented subjects to the intervention platforms. The second visit (1-3 days later) delivered the intervention and collected pre and post outcome measures of anxiety and physiologic stress (salivary cortisol). Changes in anxiety and cortisol at the second visit were compared across groups using a linear regression model in which the primary analysis compared virtual reality meditation to audio meditation and secondary analyses compared virtual reality meditation to virtual reality imagery. Results: Anxiety scores decreased in all groups, with a larger reduction among the virtual reality meditation group (difference=10.8) compared to the web-based meditation or virtual reality images groups (difference=5.8 and 5.0, respectively). After controlling for baseline values, there were no significant group differences in changes in anxiety scores or cortisol levels. In comparing virtual reality meditation and audio meditation, the effect size for anxiety was moderate (Cohen d=0.58) while the effect size for cortisol was small (Cohen d=0.08). Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest that virtual reality meditation has a moderate benefit for anxiety but not physiologic stress. Future research is needed to confirm these results in a larger sample and to investigate whether the effects are sustained or increase with repeated use of virtual reality mediation. Virtual reality meditation appears feasible to deliver among homeless youth and merits further study.

N2  - Background: Economic vulnerability, such as homelessness and unemployment, contributes to HIV risk among U.S. racial minorities. Yet, few economicstrengthening interventions have been adapted for HIV prevention in this population. Methods: This study assessed the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial of a 20-week microenterprise intervention for economically vulnerable African-American young adults. Engaging MicroenterprisE for Resource Generation and Health Empowerment (EMERGE) aimed to reduce sexual risk behaviors and increase employment and uptake of HIV preventive behaviors. The experimental group received text messages on job openings plus educational sessions, mentoring, a start-up grant, and business and HIV prevention text messages. Primary feasibility objectives assessed recruitment, randomization, participation, and retention. Secondary objectives examined employment, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV preventive behaviors. Results: Thirty-eight (n=38) participants were randomized to experimental (n=19) or comparison group (n=19) of which 95% were retained. Mean age of participants was 20.1 years; 35% were male; 81% were unemployed. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of experimental participants completed > 70% of intervention activities, and 74% completed > 50% of intervention activities. Participation in intervention activities and outcome assessments was highest in the first half (&sim; 10 weeks) of the study. The experimental group reported higher employment (from 32% at baseline to 83% at week 26) and lower unprotected sex (79% to 58%) over time compared to reported changes in employment (37% to 47%) and unprotected sex (63% to 53%) over time in the comparison group. Conclusions: Conducting this feasibility randomized clinical trial was a critical step in the process of designing and testing a behavioral intervention.

N2  - Background. Malnutrition is a major public health problem and most enveloping cause of morbidity and mortality among children and adolescents throughout the world. This study was aimed at assessing the nutritional status and associated factors among 6-10-year-old children in selected earthquake-affected areas of Gorkha district, Nepal. Methods. A community-based cross-sectional study among 420 mothers having children of age groups 6-10 years (with anthropometric measurement among children) was conducted using a mixed method in selected earthquake-affected areas of Gorkha district, Nepal, from October 2015 to April 2016. Gorkha was selected purposively from 14 earthquake-affected districts. Two village development committees were selected randomly among 6 having severe impact. Randomly, 5 wards were selected from each of the 2 village development committees. As the sample was 420, 42 children were selected randomly from every ward. Result. Among the 420 children, 31.9% were underweight, 51.9% were stunted, and 2.9% were wasted after the earthquake. Children who were more prone to being underweight were the following: male children (RR=1.34 95% CI: 1.01-1.78) and children from illiterate mothers (RR=2.49, 95% CI: 1.85-3.36), illiterate fathers (RR=1.73, 95% CI: 1.32-2.27), and homemaker mothers (RR=0.28, 95% CI: 0.20-0.38); children whose families were using nonimproved sources of water (RR=2.60, 95% CI: 1.07-6.60); and households having food insecurity (RR=12.97, 95% CI: 3.29-51.18). Similarly, children of illiterate fathers (RR=1.67, 95% CI: 1.41-1.97), children of illiterate mothers (RR=2.32, 95% CI: 1.91-2.83), children of homemaker mothers (RR=0.59, 95% CI: 0.49-0.70), children whose family were using treated water (RR=0.32, 95% CI: 0.15-0.67), and children from food insecure households (RR=10.52, CI: 4.05-27.33) were found to be stunted. After adjustment, children from households consuming nonimproved water were 6 times more likely (OR=6.75; 95% CI: 1.59-28.62) to be wasted. Conclusion. Illiterate mothers, illiterate fathers, mothers engaged in occupation other than household work, and food insecure households were found to be independent predictors of underweight and stunting. Nonimproved source of drinking water was found to be independent predictors of wasting.

N2  - Background: Young people who inject drugs (PWID) have higher HCV incidence and lower treatment initiation rates compared to their older peers. Novel, simplified care models need to be developed to engage, treat and cure hard to reach patient populations, such as young PWID. Methods: We present final data from the randomized pilot clinical trial HCV-Seek Test & Rapid Treatment (HCV-ST&RT) for curing HCV in young PWID. Eligible participants were 18-29 years of age, HCV Ab+, treatment na&iuml;ve, and had injected drugs in the past 30 days. Participants were randomized 1:1 to the Rapid Treatment or Usual Care arm. Participants randomized to Rapid Treatment received a same-day medical evaluation, confirmatory and baseline lab testing, and 7-day starter pack of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Participants in Usual Care received same-day HCV confirmatory testing and, if positive, facilitated referral to local providers. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response (SVR12) in RNA+ participant within 12 months of enrollment. Results: Among 47 eligible participants, 39 were enrolled. 14/19 in the Rapid Treatment arm and 11/20 in the Usual Care arm were confirmed HCV RNA+ and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Demographics of the RNA+ participants were similar in the two arms with a mean age of 26 years; 21% women; 43% Hispanic and 7% non-Hispanic black. At baseline 14% were homeless, 86% were on medication for opioid use disorder, and participants injected a median of 17 of the last 30 days. In the intentionto-treat analysis, 9/14 (64%) of the Rapid Treatment arm and 2/11 (18%) of the Usual Care arm had confirmed SVR12 (p=0.021). Of the 5 participants in the Rapid Treatment arm who did not achieve SVR12, 1 had treatment failure, 1 never started DAA therapy, 1 had an on-treatment response with pending SVR12 confirmation, and 2 were lost to follow-up. Conclusion: Among young HCV RNA+ PWID, significantly higher rates of cure were achieved using the Rapid Treatment model with same day, low-threshold, simplified HCV care compared to facilitated referral. Meeting young PWID where they're at and initiating HCV treatment 'in the moment' without the need for repeat visits appears to be a promising strategy for treating this hard to reach population.

T1  - Comparison of prosocial behaviors among adults with and without substance dependency

N2  - Although research has clearly demonstrated the physical and mental health benefits derived from helping others, its impact on substance dependent (SD) individuals is not yet fully understood. Emerging research suggests that SD adolescents participate less frequently in prosocial behaviors and thus may receive fewer benefits (Pagano, Carter, Johnson, and Exline, 2010). This study aims to replicate prior findings that substance dependency is associated with reduced levels of prosocial behavior involvement with SD adults. Using a matched pair design, 43 adults admitted into an intensive outpatient treatment for SD were compared to 43 normative adults from the annual General Social Survey. Prosocial behaviors were assessed with the six-item General Social Survey (GSS) altruism module: (i) donating blood, (ii) giving food or money to a homeless person, (iii) volunteering, (iv) giving money to a charity, (v) looking after a neighbor's home, and (vi) carrying a stranger's belongings. With reference to the past year, items were rated from 1 = &ldquo;more than once a week&rdquo; to 6 &ldquo;not at all in the past year.&rdquo; Approximately half (51.2%) of the clinical sample were female (n = 22), 43 years of age (M=42.77) on average, 68.29% were alcohol dependent, and 70.73% were substance dependent at the time of treatment admission. Across samples, most participants rarely or never donated blood in the past year (94.19%), approximately half had not cared for a neighbor's property (58.14%) or volunteered (59.30%), and one out of three rarely or never gave money to the homeless (30.23%) or charity (29.07%). When matched by age and gender to a normative adult sample, SD adults had significantly lower prosocial behaviors in three domains: (i) giving money to the homeless, F(1,85) = 13.89, p < 0.0001, (ii) giving money to charity, F(1,85) = 11.43, p < 0.0001, and (iii) volunteering, F(1,85) = 13.10, p < 0.0001. The results of this study are consistent with prior research with prior research with SD adolescents. SD adults, like SD youth, appear to give less money to the homeless and charity. SD adults also volunteered less than normative adults. These findings of lower monetary giving and volunteerism lend empirical support to the often observed lack of otheroriented regard among addicts/alcoholics. Replication of these findings in a larger, randomized controlled trial is warranted to explore the causal link between prosocial behaviors and alcohol/drug outcomes.

N2  - Methods: We used the ADAPT-ITT (Assessment, Decisions, Administration, Production, Topical experts, Integration, Training staff, and Testing) framework to adapt .b to a youth serving shelter. Methods used include carrying out focus group discussions (n=56), key informant interviews (n=12), and youth working groups (n=10) to identify needed modifications and beta testing those changes with the target audience. Results: Adaptations to the curriculum and delivery modality were made to approximate the average length of stay in the shelter; integrate trauma-informed approaches; increase diversity of race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and gender identity among images; and increase the relevance of the audio-visual components. Background: Youth experiencing homelessness face emotional and psychological challenges that impact their physical, mental, and social wellbeing, emotion regulation, and coping. Despite the disparity in health outcomes compared to housed peers, they remain underserved. Mindfulness reduces stress and improves resilience, emotion regulation, and executive functioning. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) teach the practice of mindfulness to foster present-moment attention without judgement and enhance self-observation and self-regulation, resulting in greater awareness of thoughts and emotions and improved interpersonal relationships. Importantly, MBIs have been found to improve affect and executive functioning across populations. One such intervention is .b, which was found to lower stress among 522 housed youth aged 12-16 years old. A pilot study of .b among sheltered youth found the intervention to be feasible in this population. Yet the results suggest that important modifications are needed to improve its relevance and accessibility and ensure a trauma-informed approach. Conclusion: Youth and the health and social services providers who care for youth generally gave positive feedback regarding the core concepts and presentation of the curriculum. Minor, yet important, changes were needed to increase the relevance, acceptability, and feasibility of the intervention. Our next steps are to conduct a randomized attention control pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability.

N2  - Homeless emerging adults ages 18-25 exhibit high rates of alcohol use, as well as sexual behaviors that increase their risk of HIV, STDs and unwanted pregnancy. Yet few risk reduction programs exist for this population, particularly ones that are both effective and can be easily incorporated into settings serving this population (e.g., shelters, drop-in centers). This study addresses an important gap in prevention services for emerging adults experiencing homelessness by conducting a cluster crossover randomized controlled trial of AWARE, an innovative group-MI (Motivational Interviewing) brief risk reduction intervention focusing on both alcohol use and sexual risk behavior. AWARE consists of four 45-minute sessions. Rolling admission is used so that youth can join the program at any time, regardless of session. The evaluation took place at three drop-in centers for 18-25 year olds experiencing homelessness in the Los Angeles area. Participants received the AWARE program (n = 132) or usual care (n = 144). Overall, the sample is predominantly male (70.3%), heterosexual (57.4%), and non-White (83.6%). Surveys were completed at baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-baseline. The 12-month follow-up rate for the sample was 87%. Program satisfaction was high and about one-third (31%) of AWARE participants completed all four sessions. AWARE participants showed significant declines over the 12 month period in their past month frequency of drinking, frequency of heavy drinking, number of drinks on drinking days, and alcohol consequences, as well as significant increase in their use of drinking protective behaviors. Control group participants did not show a significant change in any of these alcohol-related outcomes (all ps > 0.05). Among participants who reported casual partners at both baseline and 12-month surveys (n = 32), exploratory analyses found that AWARE participants had a noticeable, though non-significant decline in unprotected sex with casual partners (d = 0.24), whereas there was virtually no change for control participants. Results indicate that a brief MI-focused risk reduction program, AWARE, is effective in helping emerging adults experiencing homelessness to make positive changes in their alcohol use over a one-year period. Further, results suggest that it may also be effective in reducing unprotected sex with casual partners.

N2  - Background: People experiencing homelessness (PEH) have complex health and social care needs and most die in their early 40 s. PEH frequently use community pharmacies; however, evaluation of the delivery of structured, integrated, holistic health and social care intervention has not been previously undertaken in community pharmacies for PEH. PHOENIx (Pharmacy Homeless Outreach Engagement Non-medical Independent prescribing Rx) has been delivered and tested in Glasgow, Scotland, by NHS pharmacist independent prescribers and third sector homelessness support workers offering health and social care intervention in low threshold homeless drop-in venues, emergency accommodation and emergency departments, to PEH. Building on this work, this study aims to test recruitment, retention, intervention adherence and fidelity of community pharmacy-based PHOENIx intervention. Methods: Randomised, multi-centre, open, parallel-group external pilot trial. A total of 100 PEH aged 18 years and over will be recruited from community pharmacies in Glasgow and Birmingham. PHOENIx intervention includes structured assessment in the community pharmacy of health, housing, benefits and activities, in addition to usual care, through weekly visits lasting up to six months. A primary outcome is whether to proceed to a definitive trial based on pre-specified progression criteria. Secondary outcomes include drug/alcohol treatment uptake and treatment retention; overdose rates; mortality and time to death; prison/criminal justice encounters; healthcare utilisation; housing tenure; patient-reported measures and intervention acceptability. Analysis will include descriptive statistics of recruitment and retention rates. Process evaluation will be conducted using Normalisation Process Theory. Health, social care and personal resource use data will be identified, measured and valued. Discussion: If the findings of this pilot study suggest progression to a definitive trial, and if the definitive trial offers positive outcomes, it is intended that PHOENIx will be a publicly funded free-to-access service in community pharmacy for PEH. The study results will be shared with wider stakeholders and patients in addition to dissemination through medical journals and scientific conferences. Trial registration: International Clinical Trial Registration ISRCTN88146807. Approved protocol version 2.0 dated July 19, 2022.

N2  - Aims: The current study aimed to (1) identify classes of trajectories in the frequency of drug use during a 12-month period among homeless youth received one of three treatments, including the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA), Motivation Enhancement Therapy (MET), and Case Management (CM); and (2) examine whether treatment modalities, gender, ethnicity, and history of physical abuse would predict the class membership. Methods: Participants (N= 270) were recruited from a local drop-in center. Eligible youth met the criteria of homelessness as defined by the McKinney-Vento Act and abuse or dependence for Psychoactive Substance Use or Alcohol Disorder as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-Youth were randomized to receive CRA (n = 93), MET (n = 86), or CM (n = 91). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 3, 6 and 12 months post baseline. Results: Growth mixture modeling analysis was conducted using MPlus 7 (Muth&eacute;n and Muth&eacute;n, 1998-2012). A three-class model fit the data the best. About half of the sample (n = 125) fell into the &ldquo;fast decreasing&rdquo; class, 67 youth fell into the &ldquo;slow decreasing&rdquo; class and 73 youth fell into the &ldquo;increasing&rdquo; class. Compared to those received CM, youth received CRA showed a lower likelihood of being in the &ldquo;slow decreasing&rdquo; class than in the &ldquo;fast decreasing&rdquo; class [b =-0.75, S.E. = 0.44, p = 0.085], and youth received MET showed a lower likelihood of being in the &ldquo;increasing&rdquo; class than in the &ldquo;fast decreasing&rdquo; class [b =-0.70, S.E. = 0.41, p = 0.086]. Being African American [b = 0.17, S.E. = 0.08, p < 0.05] or female [b = 0.64, S.E. = 0.34, p = 0.059] increased the likelihood of being in the &ldquo;slow decreasing&rdquo; class than being in the &ldquo;fast decreasing&rdquo; class. Conclusions: The current findings suggest that CRA and MET may be more effective than CM since homeless youth received CRA or MET were more likely to exhibit fast reductions in the frequency of drug use during a 12-month period.

N2  - Purpose: Homeless young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 exhibit high rates of alcohol use, as well as drug use and sexual risk behaviors. Yet few risk reduction programs exist for this at-risk population, particularly ones that are both effective and can be easily incorporated into settings serving this population (e.g., drop-in centers). This study addresses an important gap in prevention services for homeless emerging adults by conducting a pilot cluster cross-over randomized controlled trial of AWARE, a group-MI (Motivational Interviewing) brief risk reduction intervention focusing on reducing both substance use and sexual risk behavior. Methods: AWARE consists of four 45-min sessions. Rolling admission is used so that youth can join the program at any time, regardless of session. The evaluation took place in two drop-in centers for homeless young adults in the Los Angeles area. Homeless young adults ages 18-25 (mean age = 21.8) received the AWARE program (n = 100) or usual care (n = 100). The sample was 73% male, 79% heterosexual, and 31%non-Hispanic white. Surveys were completed at baseline and 3 months after program completion. The 3-months follow-up rate for the sample was 91%. Results: Satisfaction with the program was high and nearly half (48%) of AWARE participants completed all four sessions. At follow-up, AWARE participants reported a lower frequency of alcohol use over the past 3 months (p = 0.01), were less likely to be classified as a frequent heavy drinker (compared to a non-drinker) in the past 30 days (p = 0.05), and showed a marginally significant positive difference in their confidence that they could reduce/quit their drinking (p = 0.09), compared to control participants. In addition, AWARE participants showed significant increases in both their readiness (p = 0.02) and confidence (p = 0.02) to change their drug use, compared to control participants. In terms of sex-related outcomes, AWARE participants reported greater condom use self-efficacy than the control group at follow-up (p = 0.05), but intervention effects were not found for number of partners or condomuse. Conclusion: Results from this pilot evaluation are promising, suggesting that a brief group-MI intervention can be effective in helping homeless young adults make positive changes in their alcohol use, as well as strengthen their motivation to reduce their drug use and their condom use self-efficacy.

N2  - Objectives: With high rates of mental and substance use disorders, physical illness, and increased mortality, homeless transitional age youth are one of our most vulnerable populations. Despite this statistic, there is a dearth of research on effective interventions for homeless youth. We describe findings from an adult trial and how they may be applied to generate evidence to serve homeless youth. Methods: At Home/Chez Soi was a 24-month randomized controlled trial of the Housing First model for homeless individuals with mental illness in five Canadian cities. Housing First combines the choice of scattered-site housing (without stipulating receipt of psychiatric treatment or sobriety) with access to intensive psychosocial services according to the level of need. Baseline measures were completed by 2,255 homeless people with serious mental illness, of whom 7 percent (n = 164) were youth aged 24 years and under. We examined differences between youth and older participants and compared the impact of the intervention with treatment as usual on housing stability and other outcomes over 24 months. Results: Compared with adults, youth were less likely to have completed high school and received regular medical care and more likely to have a drug use disorder, have been assaulted in the past 6 months, and have a learning disability. In an adjusted analysis, youth in Housing First were stably housed 65.1 percent of the 24 months compared with youth in treatment as usual, who were stably housed 30.7 percent of the time, resulting in an adjusted mean difference of 34.4 percent (95% CI 24.4-44.5, P < 0.0001). Receipt of Housing First was not associated with significant differences in other exploratory outcomes among youth. Conclusions: Despite significant differences from homeless adults with mental illness, homeless youth with mental illness seem to benefit from Housing First as designed for adults. Subgroup analysis from adult trials is one way to generate research on complex psychosocial interventions in youth, with the goal of evaluating and adapting interventions more fully to serve the most vulnerable and marginalized populations.

N2  - Objectives: Given the lack of evidence for interventions targeting housing outcomes in transitional-age homeless youth (ages 18-24 years), we aimed to test the effect of Housing First on housing stability among a group of homeless youth with mental illness enrolled in At Home/Chez Soi, a $110 million 24- month randomized controlled trial of Housing First in five Canadian cities. Methods: Homeless individuals with mental illness were randomized to receive Housing First, a scattered-site choice-based housing intervention (without preconditions of sobriety or psychiatric treatment) and mental health services according to the level of need (assertive community treatment or intensive case management), or usual care. Participants completed interviews every 6 months and measures of housing status every 3 months to a total of 24 months. We assessed housing stability as percent days stably housed as a proportion of days for which residence data were available in youth aged 18-24 years, fit a model with a three-way interaction of treatment group (age 18-24 years vs. >24 years), and compared the effect on housing stability in youth versus adults. We used a repeated measures mixed-effects model to estimate differences/ratios from baseline over 24 months for secondary health and service use outcomes. Results: Of the 2,148 total participants who were randomized, 156 were youth aged 18-24 years: 87 received Housing First and 69 received usual care. In an adjusted analysis, youth in Housing First were stably housed a mean of 437/645 (65 percent) days for which data were available compared with youth in usual care, who were stably housed a mean of 189/582 (31 percent) days, resulting in an adjusted mean difference of 34 percent (95% CI 24-45, P < 0.0001). The effect of the three-way interaction of treatment group, age, and time on housing stability was nonsignificant (P = 0.5934). Youth who received Housing First were less likely to have a period of employment (adjusted OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.24-0.99, P = 0.0456), but otherwise, their secondary outcomes were not significantly different from youth who received usual care. Conclusions: Housing First led to improved housing stability in homeless youth with mental illness and appears to be no less effective in youth than in older adults. More research is needed to guide adaptations of the model to further improve housing stability and other outcomes in youth.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with homelessnesss, and explore the relationship between homelessnesss and treatment outcomes among Black individuals. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the subgroup of Black participants (n = 73) enrolled in "X:BOT," a 24-week multisite randomized clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of extended-release naltrexone versus sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone (n = 570). Outcomes included medication initiation, return to extramedical use of opioids assessed by both self-report and urine toxicology, and engagement in medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) treatment at 28 weeks postrandomization. Descriptive statistics were performed. RESULTS: Black participants were mostly unmarried and male, and about a third were aged 21-30 years. Among people experiencing homelessnesss, more were uninsured (45.5% [10/22] vs 19.6% [10/51]), unemployed (77.3% [17/22] vs 64.7% [33/51]), and reported alcohol (40.9% [9/22] vs 23.5% [12/51]) and sedative use (54.5% [12/22] vs 17.6% [9/51]) within the previous 30 days. Compared with housed Black individuals, a slightly higher proportion of Black individuals experiencing homelessnesss successfully initiated study medication (81.1% [18/22] vs 72.6% [37/51]); similar proportions returned to opioid use during the trial (68.2% [15/22] vs 68.6% [35/51]) and were engaged in MOUD at 28 weeks after trial entry (72.2% [13/18] vs 69.7% [23/33]) among participants located for follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: These descriptive results among Black patients participating in a trial of MOUD suggest that efficacious MOUD is possible despite homelessnesss with additional clinical supports such as those provided by a clinical trial.

N2  - AIMS: Homeless mothers with young children in their care contend with high rates of substance use and low self-efficacy. However, a limited number of studies have examined these outcomes associated with housing and supportive services., DESIGN: Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) housing + support services (n = 80), (2) housing-only (n = 80), or (3) services as usual (SAU) (n = 80) and were re-assessed at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months postbaseline., SETTINGS: The study recruited a community-based sample from homeless service agencies and advertisements in a large Midwestern city., PARTICIPANTS: The study recruited two hundred forty (N = 240) women between the ages of 18 to 24 years, experiencing homelessness and with a substance use disorder (SUD) who also had a biological child under the age of 6 years in their care., MEASUREMENTS: We measured frequency of alcohol and drug use using the Form 90 semi-structured interview, and self-efficacy using Pearlin and Schooler's (1978) 7-item Mastery Scale., FINDINGS: Overall, mothers showed significant improvement in substance use and self-efficacy over time in each condition. However, as expected, patterns of change differentiated intervention groups with more mothers showing better substance use and self-efficacy outcomes in housing + supportive services than in SAU. Unexpectedly, more mothers in SAU showed better outcomes than those in housing-only., CONCLUSIONS: Substance use decreased and self-efficacy increased over time, but patterns of change characterized the intervention groups. In particular, findings suggest that when providing housing to this population, supportive services should also be offered.

N2  - Homelessness affects HIV risk and health, but little is known about the longitudinal effects of rental assistance on the housing status and health of homeless and unstably housed people living with HIV/AIDS. Homeless/unstably housed people living with HIV/AIDS (N = 630) were randomly assigned to immediate Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS (HOPWA) rental assistance or customary care. Self-reported data, CD4, and HIV viral load were collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Results showed that housing status improved in both groups, with greater improvement occurring in the treatment group. At 18 months, 51% of the comparison group had their own housing, limiting statistical power. Intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated significant reductions in medical care utilization and improvements in self-reported physical and mental health; significant differential change benefiting the treatment group was observed for depression and perceived stress. Significant differences between homeless and stably housed participants were found in as-treated analyses for health care utilization, mental health, and physical health. HOPWA rental assistance improves housing status and, in some cases, health outcomes of homeless and unstably housed people living with HIV/AIDS.

N2  - The mental health and related quality of life of runaway adolescents are global public health issues. As few intervention studies have considered the family contexts of runaway adolescents, we aimed to develop an intervention tailored specifically to the needs of this population using an Intervention Mapping protocol. First, a literature review and interviews with runaway adolescents and youth shelter workers were conducted to create a logic model of the problem. Second, the behavioral and environmental outcomes were set to adapt to stressful situations and enable families to become more resourceful in dealing with family adversity, based on the results of needs assessment. Performance objectives and changeable determinants were also created by reviewing the pertinent theories and studies. Third, theory- and evidence-based methods to influence changes in the determinants were identified. Fourth, we designed an eight-session family-based mental health program incorporating individual and family approaches for runaway adolescents. Fifth, we determined that mental health nurses at community mental health centers linked to youth shelters would serve as the program implementers. Finally, we planned a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of our program on improving runaway adolescents&rsquo; mental health status and perceived family functioning.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Individuals often report concurrent social risk factors such as food insecurity, unstable housing, and transportation barriers. Comparing relative changes between pairs of social risk factors may identify those that are more resistant to change. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a method to describe relative changes in pairs of social risk factors. RESEARCH DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study. SUBJECTS: Participants in a randomized controlled trial of hypertension care in an Urban Indian Health Organization. MEASURES: We measured 7 social risk factors (housing, transportation, food, clothing, health care, utilities, and debts) at enrollment, 6, and 12 months among 295 participants in the trial. We hypothesized that pairwise comparisons could identify social risk factors that were less likely to change over time. We used conditional odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to rank each pair. RESULTS: Food, clothing, health care, utilities, and debts had more changes between 0 and 6 months relative to housing (OR=2.3, 3.4, 4.7, 3.5, and 3.4, respectively; all 95% CI excluded 1.0). These same social risk factors also had more changes between baseline and 6 months relative to transportation (OR=2.8, 3.4, 4.9, 4.7, and 4.1, respectively; all 95% CI excluded 1.0). Changes in housing and transportation risk factors were comparable (OR=0.7, 95% CI: 0.4-1.4). Relative changes between 6 and 12 months were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Housing and transportation exhibited fewer relative changes than other social risk factors and might be more resistant to change. Awareness of the relationships between social risk factors can help define priorities for intervention.

N2  - Addressing social determinants of tuberculosis (TB) is essential to achieve elimination, including in low-incidence settings. We measured the association between socio-economic status and intermediate social determinants of health (SDHs, including drug misuse, tobacco smoking and alcohol), and TB, taking into account their clustering in individuals. We conducted a case-control study in 23-38 years old UK-born White adults with first tuberculosis episode, and randomly selected age and sex frequency-matched community controls. Data was collected on education, household overcrowding, tobacco smoking, alcohol and drugs use, and history of homelessness and prison. Analyses were done using logistic regression models, informed by a formal theoretical causal framework (Directed Acyclic Graph). 681 TB cases and 1183 controls were recruited. Tuberculosis odds were four times higher in subjects with education below GCSE O-levels, compared to higher education (OR&thinsp;=&thinsp;3.94; 95%CI: 2.74, 5.67), after adjusting for other TB risk factors (age, sex, BCG-vaccination and stays &ge;3 months in Africa/Asia). When simultaneously accounting for respective SDHs, higher tuberculosis risk was independently associated with tobacco smoking, drugs use (especially injectable drugs OR&thinsp;=&thinsp;5.67; 95%CI: 2.68, 11.98), homelessness and area-level deprivation. Population Attributable Fraction estimates suggested that tobacco and class-A drug use were, respectively, responsible for 18% and 15% of TB cases in this group. Our findings suggest that socio-economic deprivation remains a driver of tuberculosis in England, including through drugs misuse, tobacco smoking, and homelessness. These findings further support the integration of health and social services in high-risk young adults to improve TB control efforts.

N2  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) against women and food insecurity are an ever growing public health concerns in Ethiopia. However, the connection between the two is not yet well investigated. Therefore, this study compares IPV by household food security status and examines the association between IPV and food insecurity and among currently married women in childbearing age in Arba Minch town, South Ethiopia. A community based comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among 696 currently married women (15-49). A quantitative data was collected using a pretested and structured questionnaire on randomly selected women. Logistic regression was done using IBM SPSS version 20. Statistical significance was declared at p-value of less than 0.05 and odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval was used to show the degree of association. Lifetime and current IPV were 62.4% and 50%, respectively. Sixty-three (23.6%) and 285 (66.4%) women who experienced current IPV were from food secured and insecure households, respectively (P-value<0.001). The odds of experiencing current IPV were higher among women from food insecure households (AOR=6.59,95% CI(4.54,9.57)) and who were in the age range of 30-39 (AOR=2.16, 95% CI(1.34,3.56)) and it was lower among women with 10 and more years age difference with their husband (AOR=0.52, 95% CI (0.31,0.88)) and with high decision-making power (AOR=0.61, 95% CI (0.38.0.96)) than their reference groups. The prevalence of current IPV was significantly higher among women from food insecure households as compared to their counterparts. The odds of experiencing current IPV were higher among women from food insecure households. Policy makers and programme planners should consider improving urban women's household food security status in order to improve gender inequality and empower women. Multisectorial effort is needed to improve women education and other behavioral factors.

N2  - Describes the Seattle Homeless Adolescent Research project, a research demonstration program with a goal of implementing and evaluating an intensive mental health case management program for homeless adolescents. This new program, Project Passage, is based on 9 primary components: assessment, planning, linkage, monitoring or tracking, advocacy, counseling or the therapeutic relationship, treatment teams, crisis service, and flexible funds. A 3-mo follow-up of 229 youths (57% male, mean age 16.5 yrs) randomly assigned to Project Passage or a regular case management program found that both groups demonstrated significant improvements in mental health outcomes and social adjustment; however, those in Project Passage showed lower levels of aggression and greater satisfaction with their quality of life.

T1  - Substance Use and Social Stability of Homeless Youth: a Comparison of Three Interventions

Y1  - 2018//
Y2  - 2018//
N2  - The current study identified subgroups of homeless youth and young adults that exhibited distinct co-occurring patterns of substance use and social stability (e.g., employment, school attendance, and housing), and evaluated the relative effectiveness of the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA), Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), and case management (CM) in interrupting substance use and improving social stability. The differentiating effects of personal characteristics on the co-occurrence of substance use and social stability were also examined. Participants included 270 homeless youth and young adults who were randomly assigned to one of the three intervention conditions: CRA, n = 93, MET, n = 86, or CM, n = 91. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months postbaseline. A dual trajectory latent class growth analysis identified four co-occurring patterns: low-stable substance use paired with low-increasing social stability, high-stable substance use paired with low-stable social stability, high-declining substance use paired with low-increasing social stability, and low-increasing substance use paired with high-stable social stability. Findings showed that CRA was superior in improving substance use and social stability simultaneously compared to MET and CM, and further, CM was more effective than MET. Personal factors including race, age, coping strategies, and behavior problems differentiated the co-occurring patterns of substance use and social stability. The findings underscore the significance in identifying subgroups of homeless youth that vary in problem severity in terms of their substance use and social stability, and offer evidence to help practitioners identify the most effective intervention that responds to the needs of homeless youth.

N2  - Behavioral weight loss (BWL) for pediatric obesity includes guidance on improving the home food environment and dietary quality; yet food insecurity presents barriers to making these changes. This study examined if home food environment, dietary quality, energy intake, and body weight changes during adolescent obesity treatment differed by food security status, and if changes in the home food environment were associated with changes in dietary quality and energy intake by food security status. Adolescents (n = 82; 13.7 &plusmn; 1.2 years) with obesity participated in a 4-month BWL treatment. Food insecurity, home food environment (Home Food Inventory [HFI]), dietary quality (Healthy Eating Index [HEI]), energy intake, and body mass index (BMI) were assessed at baseline and post-treatment. A reduced obesogenic home food environment and improved dietary quality were observed for food secure (ps < 0.01), but not insecure households (ps > 0.05) (mean difference, HFI: -6.6 &plusmn; 6.4 vs. -2.4 &plusmn; 7.4; HEI: 5.1 &plusmn; 14.4 vs. 2.7 &plusmn; 17.7). Energy intake and BMI decreased for adolescents in food secure and insecure households (ps < 0.03) (mean difference; energy intake: -287 &plusmn; 417 vs. -309 &plusmn; 434 kcal/day; BMI: -1.0 &plusmn; 1.4 vs. -0.7 &plusmn; 1.4). BWL yielded similar reductions in energy intake and body weight yet did not offer the same benefits for improved dietary quality and the home food environment for adolescents with food insecurity.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We examined the longitudinal effects of a Housing First program for homeless, mentally ill individuals' on those individuals' consumer choice, housing stability, substance use, treatment utilization, and psychiatric symptoms., METHODS: Two hundred twenty-five participants were randomly assigned to receive housing contingent on treatment and sobriety (control) or to receive immediate housing without treatment prerequisites (experimental). Interviews were conducted every 6 months for 24 months., RESULTS: The experimental group obtained housing earlier, remained stably housed, and reported higher perceived choice. Utilization of substance abuse treatment was significantly higher for the control group, but no differences were found in substance use or psychiatric symptoms., CONCLUSIONS: Participants in the Housing First program were able to obtain and maintain independent housing without compromising psychiatric or substance abuse symptoms.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Few interventions have focused on improving end-of-life care for underserved populations, such as homeless persons., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether homeless persons will complete a counseling session on advance care planning and fill out a legal advance directive designed to assess care preferences and preserve the dignity of marginalized persons., DESIGN: Prospective, single-blind, randomized trial comparing self-guided completion of an advance directive with professionally assisted advance care planning. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00546884), SETTING: 8 sites serving homeless persons in Minneapolis, Minnesota., PARTICIPANTS: 262 homeless persons recruited between November 2007 and August 2008., INTERVENTION: Minimal, self-guided intervention consisting of advance directive forms and written educational information versus a one-on-one advance planning intervention consisting of counseling and completing an advance directive with a social worker., MEASUREMENTS: Rate of advance directive completion, assessed by inspection of completed documents., RESULTS: The overall completion rate for advance directives was 26.7% (95% CI, 21.5% to 32.5%), with a higher rate in the counselor-guided group (37.9%) than in the self-guided group (12.8%) (CI of adjusted difference, 15.3 to 34.3 percentage points). This difference persisted across all sites and most subgroups. The advance directive's 4 clinical scenarios found a preference for surrogate decision making in 29% to 34% of written responses., LIMITATIONS: Sampling was limited to a more stable subset of the homeless population in Minneapolis and may have been subject to selection bias. Modest compensation to complete the preintervention survey could have influenced participants to complete advance directives., CONCLUSION: Both a simple and complex intervention successfully engaged a diverse sample of homeless persons in advance care planning. One-on-one assistance significantly increased the completion rate. Homeless persons can respond to an intervention to plan for end-of-life care and can express specific preferences for care or a surrogate decision maker, but additional studies are needed to assess the effect of these directives on subsequent care., PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Institute for Nursing Research and National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This mixed methods study explored the characteristics of and experiences with perceived discrimination in an ethnically diverse urban sample of adults experiencing homelessness and mental illness., METHODS: Data were collected in Toronto, Ontario, as part of a 4-year national randomized field trial of the Housing First treatment model. Rates of perceived discrimination were captured from survey questions regarding perceived discrimination among 231 ethnoracially diverse participants with moderate mental health needs. The qualitative component included thirty six in-depth interviews which explored how individuals who bear these multiple identities of oppression navigate stigma and discrimination, and what affects their capacity to do so., RESULTS: Quantitative analysis revealed very high rates of perceived discrimination related to: homelessness/poverty (61.5%), race/ethnicity/skin colour (50.6%) and mental illness/substance use (43.7%). Immigrants and those who had been homeless three or more years reported higher perceived discrimination on all three domains. Analysis of qualitative interviews revealed three common themes related to navigating these experiences of discrimination among participants: 1) social distancing; 2) old and new labels/identities; and, 3) 'homeland' cultures., CONCLUSIONS: These study findings underscore poverty and homelessness as major sources of perceived discrimination, and expose underlying complexities in the navigation of multiple identities in responding to stigma and discrimination., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN42520374 .

T1  - Social Problem-Solving and Suicidal Ideation Among Homeless Youth Receiving a Cognitive Therapy Intervention: a Moderated Mediation Analysis

N2  - Despite the high prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts among homeless youth, little research has examined how suicide prevention interventions influence suicide-related risk and protective factors, and ultimately produce positive outcome in suicidality in this population. Drawing on the Diathesis-Stress Model and the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, the current study examined whether participation in Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) moderated the mediation link between social problem-solving, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, and suicidal ideation among a sample of homeless youth experiencing suicidal ideation. Social problem-solving refers to a set of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral coping responses in the face of stressful situations, and it is identified as a potent protective factor in alleviating perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, and reducing suicidal ideation. Participants included 150 homeless youth (M age= 20.99, range = 18-24; 41% female) who were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) (n = 75) or Treatment as Usual alone (n = 75). Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Findings showed that perceived burdensomeness mediated the association of social problem-solving with suicidal ideation only among youth participating in the CTSP condition. These findings provide evidence to support the promising effects of CTSP in enhancing the protective effects of social problem-solving on suicidal ideation through the mediating effects of perceived burdensomeness. Findings also have implications for improving intervention effectiveness with a community-based population at high risk of suicide.

N2  - The study tests the short-term impact on housing stability of the Family Unification Program (FUP), a permanent housing program for child welfare- involved families at risk of separation from children due to inadequate housing. Families eligible for FUP (n = 150) received housing case management services as usual, and half were referred for permanent housing vouchers made available through FUP. Families referred for FUP secured more enriched home learning environments, while more precariously housed families exhibited greater housing, stability when referred for FUP. The intervention did not relate with housing affordability or improvements in neighborhood quality. Findings suggest benefits of FUP-especially for more vulnerable families--in key areas that support child developmet; however, families continue to struggle in the context of poverty.

N2  - A randomized trial compared effects of a Family Critical Time Intervention (FCTI) to usual care for children in 200 newly homeless families in which mothers had diagnosable mental illness or substance problems. Adapted from an evidence-based practice to prevent chronic homelessness for adults with mental illnesses, FCTI combines housing and structured, time-limited case management to connect families leaving shelter with community services. Families were followed at five time points over 24 months. Data on 311 children-99 ages 1.5-5 years, 113 ages 6-10 years, and 99 ages 11-16 years-included mother-, teacher-, and child-reports of mental health, school experiences, and psychosocial well-being. Analyses used hierarchical linear modeling to investigate intervention effects and changes in child functioning over time. Referral to FCTI reduced internalizing and externalizing problems in preschool-aged children and externalizing for adolescents 11-16. The intervention led to declines in self-reported school troubles for children 6-10 and 11-16. Both experimental and control children in all age groups showed reductions in symptoms over time. Although experimental results were scattered, they suggest that FCTI has the potential to improve mental health and school outcomes for children experiencing homelessness.

N2  - Background: Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that the newest latent tuberculosis (LTBI) regimen, 12 weekly doses of directly observed isoniazid and rifapentine (3HP), is as efficacious as 9 months of isoniazid, with a greater completion rate (82% vs 69%); however, 3HP has not been assessed in routine healthcare settings. Methods: Observational cohort of LTBI patients receiving 3HP through 16 US programs was used to assess treatment completion, adverse drug reactions, and factors associated with treatment discontinuation. Results: Of 3288 patients eligible to complete 3HP, 2867 (87.2%) completed treatment. Children aged 2-17 years had the highest completion rate (94.5% [155/164]). Patients reporting homelessness had a completion rate of 81.2% (147/181). In univariable analyses, discontinuation was lowest among children (relative risk [RR], 0.44 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .23-.85]; P = .014), and highest in persons aged >=65 years (RR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.25-2.35]; P < .001). In multivariable analyses, discontinuation was lowest among contacts of patients with tuberculosis (TB) disease (adjusted RR [ARR], 0.68 [95% CI, .52-.89]; P = .005) and students (ARR, 0.45 [95% CI, .21-.98]; P = .044), and highest with incarceration (ARR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.08-1.89]; P = .013) and homelessness (ARR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.25-2.39]; P = .001). Adverse drug reactions were reported by 1174 (35.7%) patients, of whom 891 (76.0%) completed treatment. Conclusions: Completion of 3HP in routine healthcare settings was greater overall than rates reported from clinical trials, and greater than historically observed using other regimens among reportedly nonadherent populations. Widespread use of 3HP for LTBI treatment could accelerate elimination of TB disease in the United States.

N2  - Objective To assess the rate of visual impairment and quantify the unmet eye care needs within Toronto's homeless youth community. Design Prospective and cross sectional. Participants Ninety randomly selected homeless youth aged 16-24 years. Methods From each of 9 participating homeless youth shelters and drop-in centres in Toronto, 10 English-speaking youths between ages 16 and 24 were randomly recruited. Information regarding sociodemographics, medical history, subjective visual acuity, and access to eye care was collected. Comprehensive visual screening and undilated direct fundoscopy were also performed. Results The median age of participants was 21 years (interquartile range = 19-23 years), and 62.2% were male. Most participants were homeless for less than 5 years (90%) and earning less than $500 monthly (57.8%). Despite 51.1% of participants having previously owned corrective lenses, only 20% of participants currently owned them when assessed/at study time. When analyzing the better-seeing eye, presenting visual acuity was 20/50 or worse in 18.9% (95% CI 10.8%-27.0%) of participants. Pinhole occlusion decreased the number to 2.2% (95% CI 0%-5.3%). The most common cause of visual impairment was uncorrected refractive error. Ocular pathology was observed in 8 participants. Compared to adults, youth have similar functional visual impairment (adults 24.0%, youth 18.9%) but less impairment uncorrectable by pinhole occlusion (adults 11.0%, youth 2.2%) and are less dissatisfied with their vision (adults 70.0%, youths 36.7%). Although a higher proportion of homeless youths have visited an eye specialist in the past year (adults 14.0%; youths 17.8%), neither group is visiting as frequently as the Canadian average (41%) (p < 0.01). Conclusions Homeless youth have a high prevalence of visual impairment, even when living within a system of universal health insurance. Ongoing vision-screening programs, readily accessible free eye clinics, and particularly low-cost glasses may help address this need.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Directly observed treatment (DOT) has been the standard of care for tuberculosis since the early 1990s, but it is inconvenient for patients and service providers. Video-observed therapy (VOT) has been conditionally recommended by WHO as an alternative to DOT. We tested whether levels of treatment observation were improved with VOT., METHODS: We did a multicentre, analyst-blinded, randomised controlled superiority trial in 22 clinics in England (UK). Eligible participants were patients aged at least 16 years with active pulmonary or non-pulmonary tuberculosis who were eligible for DOT according to local guidance. Exclusion criteria included patients who did not have access to charging a smartphone. We randomly assigned participants to either VOT (daily remote observation using a smartphone app) or DOT (observations done three to five times per week in the home, community, or clinic settings). Randomisation was done by the SealedEnvelope service using minimisation. DOT involved treatment observation by a health-care or lay worker, with any remaining daily doses self-administered. VOT was provided by a centralised service in London. Patients were trained to record and send videos of every dose ingested 7 days per week using a smartphone app. Trained treatment observers viewed these videos through a password-protected website. Patients were also encouraged to report adverse drug events on the videos. Smartphones and data plans were provided free of charge by study investigators. DOT or VOT observation records were completed by observers until treatment or study end. The primary outcome was completion of 80% or more scheduled treatment observations over the first 2 months following enrolment. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and restricted (including only patients completing at least 1 week of observation on allocated arm) analyses were done. Superiority was determined by a 15% difference in the proportion of patients with the primary outcome (60% vs 75%). This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number registry, number ISRCTN26184967., FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2014, and Oct 1, 2016, we randomly assigned 226 patients; 112 to VOT and 114 to DOT. Overall, 131 (58%) patients had a history of homelessness, imprisonment, drug use, alcohol problems or mental health problems. In the ITT analysis, 78 (70%) of 112 patients on VOT achieved &ge;80% scheduled observations successfully completed during the first 2 months compared with 35 (31%) of 114 on DOT (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 5&middot;48, 95% CI 3&middot;10-9&middot;68; p<0&middot;0001). In the restricted analysis, 78 (77%) of 101 patients on VOT achieved the primary outcome compared with 35 (63%) of 56 on DOT (adjusted OR 2&middot;52; 95% CI 1&middot;17-5&middot;54; p=0&middot;017). Stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting were the most common adverse events reported (in 16 [14%] of 112 on VOT and nine [8%] of 114 on DOT)., INTERPRETATION: VOT was a more effective approach to observation of tuberculosis treatment than DOT. VOT is likely to be preferable to DOT for many patients across a broad range of settings, providing a more acceptable, effective, and cheaper option for supervision of daily and multiple daily doses than DOT., FUNDING: National Institute for Health Research.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There is scarce evidence on prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among individuals who are homeless and diagnosed with severe mental illness. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of HCV infection and associated risk factors in a representative sample of adults from At Home study. METHODS: The Vancouver At Home study is part of the At Home/Chez Soi (AH/CS) project-a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of a Housing First intervention among homeless persons with mental illness in five Canadian cities between 2009 and 2013 with a 2-year follow-up period. RESULTS: Of 497 participants, 28% reported positive HCV serostatus. Educational level equal or less than eighth grade (AOR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 4.8), history of incarceration (AOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.5), substance dependence (AOR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.1, 3.7) and injection drug use during one month prior to the recruitment (AOR: 7.8, 95% CI: 4.0, 15.0) were associated with an increased risk of HCV infection. Having a psychotic disorder (AOR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.3, 1.0) and age < 25 (AOR: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.0, 0.7) were associated with a lower risk. Blood tests performed on 30 participants agreed with self-report in 97% of cases [Kappa = 0.9 (95% CI: 0.6, 1.3), PABAK = 0.9]. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of HCV among individuals who were homeless with mental illness underlies the importance of prevention and treatment of HCV in this population, especially those with concurrent substance use disorders. Self-report seems to be a valid tool for evaluation of the HCV status in this population.

N2  - Few studies have evaluated the impact of nutritional supplementation among pregnant adolescents. We examined the effects of the Rang Din Nutrition Study (RDNS) interventions on children born to mothers <20 years of age. The RDNS was a cluster-randomized effectiveness trial with four arms: (1) women and children both received small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS-LNS), (2) women received iron and folic acid (IFA) and children received LNS (IFA-LNS), (3) women received IFA and children received micronutrient powder (MNP) (IFA-MNP), and (4) women received IFA and children received no supplements (IFA-Control). We enrolled 4011 women at <20 weeks gestation; 1552 were adolescents. Among adolescents, prenatal LNS reduced newborn stunting by 25% and small head size by 28% and had a marginally significant effect on newborn wasting, compared with IFA. Low birth weight and preterm birth were reduced only among adolescents with lower food security. Effects on subsequent growth status were observed only among female children in the LNS-LNS group: less stunting at 18 months (versus IFA-MNP) and lower prevalence of small head circumference and wasting at 24 months (versus IFA-Control). Initiatives targeting pregnant adolescents in similar settings should consider inclusion of small-quantity LNS, particularly for adolescents living in food-insecure households.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Homeless youth experience high rates of substance use disorders, exposures to violence, mental and physical health conditions, and mortality. They have been particularly affected by the opioid crisis. However, no study to date has used a randomized controlled design to test preventive interventions of opioid and other drug use among this vulnerable population. Resolution of youth homelessness through housing and supportive services including prevention services, often referred to as "Housing First," has great potential to reduce the likelihood for the development of an opioid use disorder as well as other problem behaviors associated with living on the streets. Housing First has been tested through randomized trials among homeless adults with mental health and substance use disorders, but has not been empirically tested for opioid prevention among homeless youth. METHODS: Homeless youth will be recruited from a drop-in shelter site frequented by disconnected youth; they will be screened for eligibility, including current homelessness, age 18-24 years, and not currently meeting criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). In a controlled trial, 240 youth will then be randomized to one of two conditions, (1) housing&thinsp;+&thinsp;opioid and related risk prevention services, or (2) opioid and related risk prevention services alone. This project utilizes existing efficacious models of prevention to address opioid-related risks, including motivational interviewing, strengths-based outreach and advocacy, and an HIV risk preventive intervention. Follow-up will be conducted at 3, 6, 9 and 12-months post-baseline. The economic cost of each intervention will be determined to support implementation decisions with other providers and their funders. DISCUSSION: This study will provide essential information for researchers and providers on the efficacy of housing&thinsp;+&thinsp;opioid and related risk prevention services in an RCT for effects on opioid use and mechanisms underlying change. Because youth experiencing homelessness are at increased risk for a variety of adverse outcomes, the proposed intervention may produce substantial health care benefits to the youths and society at large.

N2  - The North American Opiate Medication Initiative (NAOMI) is a randomized controlled trial evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of heroin-assisted treatment (HAT) in the Canadian context. Our objective is to analyze the profile of the NAOMI participant cohort in the context of illicit opioid use in Canada and to evaluate its comparability with patient profiles of European HAT studies. Recruitment began in February 2005 and ended in March 2007. Inclusion criteria included opioid dependence, 5 or more years of opioid use, regular opioid injection, and at least two previous opiate addiction treatment attempts. Standardized assessment instruments such as the European Addiction Severity Index and the Maudsley Addiction Profile were employed. A total of 251 individuals were randomized from Vancouver, BC (192, 76.5%), and Montreal, Quebec (59, 23.5%); 38.5% were female, the mean age was 39.7 years (SD:8.6), and participants had injected drugs for 16.5 years (SD:9.9), on average. In the prior month, heroin was used a mean of 26.5 days (SD:7.4) and cocaine 16 days (SD;12.6). Vancouver had significantly more patients residing in unstable housing (88.5 vs. 22%; p < 0.001) and higher use of smoked crack cocaine (16.9 days vs. 2.3 days in the prior month; p < 0.001), while a significantly higher proportion of Montreal participants reported needle sharing in the prior 6 months (25% vs. 3.7%; p < 0.001). In many respects, the patient cohort was similar to the European trials; however, NAOMI had a higher proportion of female participants and participants residing in unstable housing. This study suggests that the NAOMI study successfully recruited participants with a profile indicated for HAT. It also raises concern about the high levels of crack cocaine use and social marginalization.

N2  - Homeless youth are at increased risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and HBV vaccine coverage is poor in this group. The purpose of our study was to determine if a shelter-based HBV vaccine program in children and adolescents 2-18 years of age with a randomized controlled trial using a culturally appropriate HBV video could increase HBV vaccine coverage rates. Subjects were randomized to an 8 min HBV video or a control, smoking prevention video. Before exposure to the videos, HBV knowledge, and demographics were assessed in caregivers and adolescents. HBV vaccine no. 1 was offered to all subjects who did not produce a vaccine record; subsequently, an accurate HBV vaccine history was obtained from medical providers. Subjects were asked to return 1 and 3 months after visit 1, HBV vaccine was offered to all with incomplete coverage, and HBV knowledge was reassessed. There were 328 children and adolescents cared for by 170 caregivers enrolled in the study. One hundred and four had incomplete HBV vaccine coverage. Data are reported for all family units with at least one subject needing vaccine. There were 53 children and adolescents randomized to the HBV video vs. 51 to the smoking video. HBV knowledge scores of caregivers improved at Visit no. 2 vs. no. 1 in the HBV video group (p = 0.01) but not in the smoking group (p = 0.82). Similar results were observed for adolescents in the HBV video group (p = 0.05) but not in the smoking group (p = 0.40). Exposure to the HBV video vs the smoking video had a significant effect on return rates for vaccine at Visit no. 2 (59 vs. 31%; p = 0.05) but not at Visit no. 3 (47 vs. 18%, p = 0.06). The shelter-based vaccine program was very effective in increasing HBV coverage rates in the entire group of 328 children and adolescents enrolled in the study, from 68% coverage at baseline to 85% at the conclusion of the study. We conclude that shelter-based HBV vaccine programs can be highly effective in increasing vaccine coverage rates in older children and adolescents. A brief exposure to a culturally appropriate HBV video improves HBV knowledge and may improve return rates for vaccine.

N2  - Background NEETs (young people not in employment, education or training) are at higher risk for poorer mental and physical health. In France, the Missions locales (MLs) are the only social structures dedicated to this population. We sought to determine whether the systematic offer of a social and preventive medicine consultation at a ML might increase NEET participants&rsquo; access to training in the 12 months following the intervention. Methods This intervention research was a parallel randomised controlled interventional study conducted at five MLs in mainland France in 2011&ndash;2012. It included 976 NEETs aged 18 to 25 years who attended one of the five MLs. At inclusion, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to three groups: those in the first group were invited to see a social worker (not studied in this paper), those in the second group were invited to see a doctor and a social worker (intervention group), and the third was a control group. The primary outcome was participation in at least one training session during the year following study inclusion. Results Among the 976 participants, 504 were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 472 to the control group; 704 (72.1%) were included in the analyses. A significantly higher proportion of the participants in the intervention group participated in a training session in the 12 months following the intervention than of those in the control group (63.3% vs 55.6%; p = 0.04). This difference was significantly greater for women, those less than 21 years of age, those unstably housed and those with a lower level of education. Conclusions Social and preventive medicine consultations that are fully integrated into the social services for NEETs have an impact on their access to training and contribute to changing some of their health-related behaviours. This may improve their access to the labour market.

N2  - The purpose of this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to compare the 6-month outcomes of a Dialectical Behavioral Therapy-Corrections Modified (DBT-CM) program versus a Health Promotion (HP) program on mitigating recidivism among 130 female parolees/probationers between baseline and 6-month follow-up. The effect of DBT-CM on reducing recidivism was greater among those who expressed a desire for help (risk ratio [RR] = 0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.16, 1.00]; p = .050) and among homeless female ex-offenders (HFOs) who were younger (<50 years of age; RR = 0.46; 95% CI = [0.19, 1.11]; p = .085) and participants with Desire for Help score > 35 (Model 3; RR = 0.40; 95% CI = [0.16, 1.00]; p = .050). Findings from this pilot study suggest that the DBT-CM intervention may be effective in reducing reincarceration rates among some HFOs during reentry. Larger RCTs are needed to validate our findings.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Cigarette smoking is associated with many adverse health effects and is an important public health concern. Increased understanding of smokers' behavior is central to developing effective interventions. Cigarette scavenging, a behavior that involves smoking shared or previously used cigarettes has thus far only been shown to be prevalent among homeless or incarcerated populations. The current study examines whether cigarette scavenging is prevalent in a more general population of adult smokers enrolling in a smoking cessation clinical trial, and whether engagement in this behavior is associated with demographic or smoking-related psychosocial factors., METHODS: Baseline data was obtained from adult smokers (N=227) enrolling in a randomized clinical trial for smoking cessation. Cigarette scavenging was assessed using three items: a) sharing a cigarette with a stranger; b) smoking a "found" cigarette and c) smoking a previously used cigarette "butt". Participants who endorsed engaging in at least one of these three behaviors were categorized as a scavenger., RESULTS: Approximately 32% of participants endorsed at least one cigarette scavenging behavior. A multiple logistic regression analysis found that scavengers were more likely to be: men (p<0.001), of younger age at smoking onset (p=0.012), unemployed (p=0.003), more likely to have used marijuana in the past 30days (p=0.005), single or living alone (p=0.003), and to have experienced higher withdrawal symptoms during previous quit attempts (p=0.044) as compared to non-scavengers., CONCLUSIONS: Scavenging is common among adult smokers. Interventions that address cigarette scavenging behaviors may better meet the needs of this unique smoking subgroup.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this article is to present the rationale and baseline results for a randomized controlled pilot trial using economic incentives to reduce HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk among male sex workers (MSWs) in Mexico City., METHODS: Participants (n=267) were tested and treated for STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and HIV) and viral hepatitis (hepatitis B and C), received HIV and STI prevention education and were randomized into four groups: (1) control, (2) medium conditional incentive ($50/six months), (3) high conditional incentive ($75/six months) and (4) unconditional incentive ($50/six months). In the conditional arms, incentives were contingent upon testing free of new curable STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis) at follow-up assessments., RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 25 years; 8% were homeless or lived in a shelter, 16% were unemployed and 21% lived in Mexico City less than 5 years. At baseline, 38% were living with HIV, and 32% tested positive for viral hepatitis or at least one STI (other than HIV). Participants had a mean of five male clients in the previous week; 18% reported condomless sex with their last client. For 37%, sex work was their main occupation and was conducted mainly on the streets (51%) or in bars/discotheques (24%) and hotels (24%). The average price for a sex transaction was $25 with a 35% higher payment for condomless sex., CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that economic incentives are a relevant approach for HIV prevention among MSWs, given the market-based inducements for unprotected sex. This type of targeted intervention seems to be justified and should continue to be explored in the context of combination prevention efforts.

N2  - The current study examined heterogeneous trajectories of suicidal ideation among homeless youth experiencing suicidal ideation over 9 months in a randomized controlled intervention study. Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Youth reported their suicidal ideation four times during a 9-month period. We also assessed pretreatment mental health, demographic information and session attendance as predictors of the subgroups, as well as suicide-related factors as outcomes at the 9-month follow-up. Growth mixture models suggested three distinct trajectory groups among youth: Fast Declining (74.7%), Chronic (19.3%), and Steadily Declining (6.0%). Youth in the Chronic group used more substances at baseline than the Steadily Declining group, were more likely to be White, non-Hispanic than the Fast Declining group, and attended more CTSP sessions than other groups. Contrastingly, youth in the Steadily Declining group all experienced childhood abuse. Finally, youth in the Chronic group showed significant higher risk for future suicide compared to those in the Fast Declining group at 9 months. Findings support the heterogeneity of treatment responses in suicide intervention among homeless youth, with implications to improve treatment efforts in this very high-risk population.

N2  - BACKGROUND: While homelessness among youth is a serious problem, there is little information about evidence-based interventions for homeless youth. In cooperation with professionals and youths, Wolf (2012) developed Houvast (Dutch for 'grip'): a strengths based method grounded in scientific and practice evidence. The main aim of Houvast is to improve the quality of life of homeless youths by focusing on their strengths, thus stimulating their capacity for autonomy and self-reliance., METHOD/DESIGN: The effectiveness and fidelity of Houvast will be tested in ten Dutch services for homeless youth which are randomly allocated to an intervention group (n = 5), or a control group which provides care as usual (n = 5). Measurements of both objective and subjective quality of life and secondary outcomes (mental and physical health, substance use, coping, resilience, psychological needs, care needs, working relationship with the professional and attainment of personal goals) will be conducted among homeless youths (n = 251). Youths in both groups will be interviewed by means of a structured interview at baseline, at time of ending care or after having received care for six months (T1) and at nine months after baseline (T2). Model fidelity will be tested around T1., DISCUSSION: This study is unique as it includes a large number of homeless youths who are followed for a period of nine months, and because it focuses on a strengths based approach. If the Houvast method proves to be effective in improving quality of life it will be the first evidence-based intervention for homeless youth., TRIAL REGISTRATION: [corrected] Netherlands Trail Register (NTR):NTR3254.

N2  - Homeless young adults exhibit high rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and sexual risk behaviors. This study is a secondary analysis of data collected in a randomized clinical trial of AWARE, a new 4 session group motivational interviewing intervention. AWARE mainly focused on alcohol use and sexual risk behavior given focus group feedback. We used sequential coding to analyze how the group process affected both AOD use and sexual risk behavior at 3-month follow up among homeless young adults by examining facilitator behavior and participant change talk (CT) and sustain talk (ST). We analyzed 57 group session digital recordings of 100 youth (69% male, 74% heterosexual, 28% non-Hispanic white, 23% African American, 26% Hispanic, 23% multiracial/other; mean age 21.75). Outcomes included importance and readiness to change AOD use and risky sexual behavior, AOD use and consequences, number of partners and unprotected sex, and condom self-efficacy. Sequential analysis indicated that facilitator open-ended questions and reflections of CT increased Group CT. Group CT was associated with a lower likelihood of being a heavy drinker 3 months later; Group ST was associated with decreased readiness and confidence to change alcohol use. There were no associations with CT or ST for drug use or risky sexual behavior. Facilitator speech and peer responses were related to CT and ST during the group sessions with this high risk population, which were then associated with individual changes for alcohol use. Further research is needed to explore associations with drug use and sexual risk behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record

N2  - Economic vulnerability, such as homelessness and unemployment, contributes to HIV risk among U.S. racial minorities. Yet, few economic-strengthening interventions have been adapted for HIV prevention in this population. This study assessed the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial of a 20-week microenterprise intervention for economically-vulnerable African-American young adults. Engaging MicroenterprisE for Resource Generation and Health Empowerment (EMERGE) aimed to reduce sexual risk behaviors and increase employment and uptake of HIV preventive behaviors. The experimental group received text messages on job openings plus educational sessions, mentoring, a start-up grant, and business and HIV prevention text messages. The comparison group received text messages on job openings only. Primary feasibility objectives assessed recruitment, randomization, participation, and retention. Secondary objectives examined employment, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV preventive behaviors. Outcome assessments used an in-person pre- and post-intervention interview and a weekly text message survey. Several progression criteria for a definitive trial were met. Thirty-eight participants were randomized to experimental (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;19) or comparison group (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;19) of which 95% were retained. The comparison intervention enhanced willingness to be randomized and reduced non-participation. Mean age of participants was 21.0 years; 35% were male; 81% were unemployed. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of experimental participants completed&thinsp;&ge;&thinsp;70% of intervention activities, and 74% completed&thinsp;&ge;&thinsp;50% of intervention activities. Participation in intervention activities and outcome assessments was highest in the first half (, &thinsp;10 weeks) of the study. Seventy-one percent (71%) of weekly text message surveys received a response through week 14, but responsiveness declined to 37% of participants responding to&thinsp;&ge;&thinsp;70% of weekly text message surveys at the end of the study. The experimental group reported higher employment (from 32% at baseline to 83% at week 26) and lower unprotected sex (79% to 58%) over time compared to reported changes in employment (37% to 47%) and unprotected sex (63% to 53%) over time in the comparison group. Conducting this feasibility trial was a critical step in the process of designing and testing a behavioral intervention. Development of a fully-powered effectiveness trial should take into account lessons learned regarding intervention duration, screening, and measurement.Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov.

N2  - Background: There is limited experimental evidence on transitional care interventions beyond 30 days post-discharge and in vulnerable populations. Objective: Evaluate effects of a transitional care practice (TC) that comprehensively addresses patients&rsquo; medical and psychosocial needs following hospital discharge. Design: Pragmatic, randomized comparative effectiveness trial. Patients: Adults discharged from an initial emergency, observation, or inpatient hospital encounter with no trusted usual source of care. Interventions: TC intervention included a scheduled post-discharge appointment at the TC practice, where a multidisciplinary team comprehensively assessed patients&rsquo; medical and psychosocial needs, addressed modifiable barriers, and subsequent linkage to a new primary care source. Routine Care involved assistance scheduling a post-discharge appointment with a primary care provider that often partnered with the hospital where the initial encounter occurred. Main Measures: The primary outcome was a binary indicator of death or additional hospital encounters within 90 days of initial discharge. Secondary outcomes included any additional hospital encounters, and counts of hospital encounters, over 180 days. Key Results: Four hundred ninety patients were randomized to TC intervention and 164 to Routine Care; 34.6% were uninsured, 49.7% had Medicaid, and 57.4% were homeless or lived in a high-poverty area. There was no significant difference between arms in the 90-day probability of death or additional hospital encounters (relative risk [RR] 0.89; 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74&ndash;1.13). However, TC patients had 37% and 35% lower probability of any inpatient admission over 90 days (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.43&ndash;0.91) and 180 days (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.47&ndash;0.89), respectively. Over 180 days, TC patients had 42% fewer inpatient admissions (incidence rate ratio 0.58; 95% CI 0.37&ndash;0.90). Conclusions: Among patients randomized to a patient-centered transitional care intervention, there was no significant reduction in 90-day probability of death or additional hospital encounters. However, there were significant decreases in measures of inpatient admissions over 180 days. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03066492.

N2  - This study compared the costs and outcomes associated with three treatment programs that served 149 individuals with dual disorders (i.e., individuals with co-occurring severe mental illness and substance use disorders) who were homeless at baseline. The three treatment programs were: Integrated Assertive Community Treatment (IACT), Assertive Community Treatment only (ACTO), and standard care (Control). Participants were randomly assigned to treatment and followed for a period of 24 months. Clients in the IACT and ACTO programs were more satisfied with their treatment program and reported more days in stable housing than clients in the Control condition. There were no significant differences between treatment groups on psychiatric symptoms and substance use. The average total costs associated with the IACT and Control conditions were significantly less than the average total costs for the ACTO condition.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Studies indicate high rates of substance use among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH). Further, the social networks of YEH, although multi-dimensional in composition, are largely comprised of other YEH, substance users, and individuals who do not provide the youth with tangible or emotional support. For YEH who have the opportunity to enter a housing program, helping them to reduce their substance use and strengthen their prosocial supportive connections during this critical transition period may increase their stability and reduce their risk of re-entering homelessness. The goal of this study is to pilot test a brief motivational network intervention (MNI), delivered by case managers, to help former YEH who have recently transitioned to a housing program reduce their substance use and strengthen their prosocial supportive connections. METHODS/DESIGN: Up to 60 residents of housing programs in the Los Angeles area will be randomized to receive four sessions of usual case manager support or four sessions of case manager support&thinsp;+&thinsp;MNI. Each MNI session consists of three parts: (1) identifying two goals that are most important for the resident over the next year (e.g., get or keep a job, finish or stay in school, reduce substance use); (2) a network interview with the resident to capture network data pertaining to their interactions in the past 2 weeks; and (3) a discussion between the case manager and the resident of the resulting network visualizations, conducted in a Motivational Interviewing (MI) style, and what role the resident's network may play in reaching their most important goals over the next year. DISCUSSION: This study addresses a critical gap by pilot testing a computer-assisted MNI, delivered using MI techniques, that can help case managers work with recent YEH to reduce substance use and increase permanent supportive connections during the critical transitional period from homelessness to housing.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Behavioral intervention research has lagged behind biomedical research in developing principles for defining, categorizing, identifying, reporting, and monitoring adverse events and unanticipated problems., PURPOSE: In this article we present a set of principles for defining adverse events and how they were applied in a large national multi-site family therapy study for substance-using adolescents, The Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT) Effectiveness Study., METHODS: The BSFT Effectiveness study tested how BSFT compares to Treatment as Usual (TAU) for the treatment of drug-abusing adolescents. During protocol development, experts in the BSFT intervention, medical safety officers, ethicists and senior investigators defined the procedures for identifying, tracking and reporting adverse events for drug using adolescents as well as their family members. During this process the team identified five key guiding principles., RESULTS: The five guiding principles that were used for defining adverse events in this behavioral trial were that that the adverse events should be validated and plausible, and that monitoring systems should assess relatedness, be systematic, and are a shared responsibility. The following non-serious adverse events were identified: arrest, school suspension and drop out, runaway, kicked out of home and violence. The serious adverse events in this study for the identified adolescent participant and all other consented family members were physical or sexual abuse, suicidal behavior, homicidal behavior, hospitalization (drug related or psychiatric related only) and death. The methods used in categorizing, identifying and reporting adverse events in the BSFT trial are outlined. More than 50% of the adolescent population (277/481 = 57.5 %) experienced an adverse event during the trial. Family members experienced less adverse events, (61/1338 = 4.5%). The most common event for the adolescent group was arrest (164/277= 59.2%), followed by school suspension/dropout (143/277 = 51.6%), and runaway (79/277= 28.5 %). For the family member group, the most common event was violence (25/ 61 = 40.9%) followed by arrest (13/61 = 21.3%). There was a significant difference in the presence of adverse events in family members that were randomized to BSFT 44/721 (6.1%) when compared to Treatment as Usual 17/617 (2.8%) (p = 0.004). A probable explanation for this is that there were more opportunities to identify adverse events for family members assigned to BSFT because family members attended therapy sessions. This difference may also represent the risk for family members that participate in an evidence-based family intervention like BSFT., LIMITATIONS: The utility of the principles outside of the BSFT trial is unknown., CONCLUSIONS: Based on the events reported in this trial, the efforts for monitoring and categorizing adverse events appeared justified and appropriate. The strategies and principles described in this paper may be useful for those developing safety plans for behavioral intervention research, and to family therapy researchers for assessing the safety of behavioral family interventions.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The paper presents two-year findings from a study investigating the effectiveness of Housing First (HF) with assertive community treatment (ACT) in helping individuals with serious mental illness, who are homeless or precariously housed and living in a small city, to become stably housed., METHODS: The research design was a parallel group non-blinded RCT with participants randomly assigned after the baseline interview to receive HF with ACT (N&thinsp;=&thinsp;100) or treatment as usual (TAU; N&thinsp;=&thinsp;101). Participants were interviewed every 3&thinsp;months over 21/24&thinsp;months to investigate changes on a range of housing and psychosocial outcomes. The primary outcomes were housing stability (as defined by a joint function of number of days housed and number of moves) and improvement in community functioning. Secondary predicted outcomes were improvements in self-rated physical and mental health status, substance use problems, quality of life, community integration, and recovery., RESULTS: An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted. Compared to TAU participants, HF participants who entered housing did so more quickly (23.30 versus 88.25&thinsp;days, d&thinsp;=&thinsp;1.02, 95% CI [0.50-1.53], p&thinsp;<&thinsp;0.001), spent a greater proportion of time stably housed (Z&thinsp;=&thinsp;5.30, p&thinsp;<&thinsp;0.001, OR&thinsp;=&thinsp;3.12, 95% CI [1.96-4.27]), and rated the quality of their housing more positively (Z&thinsp;=&thinsp;4.59, p&thinsp;<&thinsp;0.001, d&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.43, 95% CI [0.25-0.62]). HF participants were also more likely to be housed continually in the final 6&thinsp;months (i.e., 79.57% vs. 55.47%), &khgr;2 (2, n&thinsp;=&thinsp;170)&thinsp;=&thinsp;11.46, p&thinsp;=&thinsp;.003, Cramer's V&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.26, 95% CI [0.14-0.42]). HF participants showed greater gains in quality of life, (Z&thinsp;=&thinsp;3.83, p&thinsp;<&thinsp;0.001, ASMD&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.50, 95% CI [0.24-0.75]), psychological integration (Z&thinsp;=&thinsp;12.89, p&thinsp;<&thinsp;0.001, pooled ASMD&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.91, 95% CI [0.77-1.05]), and perceived recovery (Z&thinsp;=&thinsp;2.26, p&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.03, ASMD&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.39, 95% CI [0.05-0.74]) than TAU participants., CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that HF ends homelessness significantly more rapidly than TAU for a majority of individuals with serious mental illness who have a history of homelessness and live in a small city. In addition, compared to TAU, HF produces psychosocial benefits for its recipients that include an enhanced quality of life, a greater sense of belonging in the community, and greater improvements in perceived recovery from mental illness., TRIAL REGISTRATION: International Standard Randomized Control Trial Number Register Identifier: ISRCTN42520374 , assigned August 18, 2009.

N2  - Homeless adults are at high risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In addition to culturally sensitive programmes designed to enhance vaccination compliance, accelerated HBV vaccination (three doses over 21 days) have also been suggested to improve compliance among high-risk groups. In this paper, we examined predictors of completers of two of three doses of a HAV/HBV vaccine series, normally delivered over a 6-month period, to simulate compliance with an accelerated series, dosed over 4 weeks. A convenience sample of 865 homeless adults was randomized into a nurse case-managed approach (NCMIT) vs standard programmes with (SIT) and without tracking (SI). Each group was assessed for completion of two of the three dose HAV/HBV vaccine series as well as the full three dose vaccine series. Sixty-eight percent of the NCMIT participants completed the three dose vaccination series at 6 months compared to 61% of SIT participants and 54% of SI participants. Eighty-one percent of the NCMIT participants completed two of the vaccinations compared to 78% of SIT participants and 73% of SI participants. The NCMIT approach resulted in greater numbers of completers of two of three doses and of the full three dose vaccine series. Predictors of completers of two doses and the full three dose vaccine series are provided. A greater number of homeless persons completed two doses across the three groups compared to the three dose vaccine series. The use of nurse case-management and tracking, coupled with an accelerated HAV/HBV vaccination schedule, may optimize vaccination compliance in homeless adults.

N2  - Investigators examined the 6-month impact of three cognitive-behavioral HIV risk-reduction programs on behavioral factors (substance use and sexual risk behaviors) and cognitive and psychological resources of 325 women who resided in emergency or sober-living shelters and their 308 intimate sexual partners. Participants were randomized by shelter to a peer-mentored, a nurse case-managed, or a standard care HIV risk-reduction program. Significant improvements were observed in all groups in all behavioral factors and cognitive and psychological resources except for self-esteem. Participants in the peer-mentored and nurse case-managed groups did not differ significantly from the standard group in self-esteem, life satisfaction, psychological well-being, use of noninjection drugs, sex with multiple partners, and unprotected sex at 6 months (n = 633). It was concluded that a standard approach by health care professionals appears to effectively modify HIV risk behaviors for a majority of homeless participants and may have important economic and policy implications. Further, the impact of short-term programs that address psychological vulnerabilities of impoverished populations needs to be studied further.

N2  - Addressing stigma remains a pressing HIV priority globally. Young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM, ages 18&ndash;30; N = 474) completed an in-person baseline survey and reported their experiences of externalized stigma (i.e., racial and sexuality discrimination), internalized stigma (i.e., homonegativity), social support, and psychological distress (i.e., anxiety and depression symptoms). We used structural equation modeling to test the association between stigma and psychological distress, and examined whether social support mediated the relationship between stigma and psychological distress. Recognizing that these associations may differ by HIV status, we compared our models by self-reported HIV status (n = 275 HIV negative/unknown; n = 199 living with HIV). Our findings suggest that YBMSM who experience stigma are more vulnerable to psychological distress and may have diminished buffering through social support. These effects are accentuated among YBMSM living with HIV, highlighting the need for additional research focused on the development of tailored stigma reduction interventions for YBMSM.

N2  - Inadequate housing and homelessness among families represent a substantial challenge for child and adolescent well-being. Child welfare services confront housing that threatens placement into foster care with little resources and evidence to guide practice. The present study provides the first rigorous test of the Family Unification Program (FUP) &ndash; a federal program that offers housing subsidies for inadequately housed families under investigation for child maltreatment. A randomized controlled trial assesses program impact on foster care placement and costs. The experiment referred intact child welfare-involved families whose inadequate housing threatened foster placement in Chicago, IL to FUP plus housing advocacy (n = 89 families with 257 children) or housing advocacy alone (n = 89 families with 257 children). Families were referred from 2011 to 2013, and administrative data recorded dates and costs of foster placements over a 3-year follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses suggested families randomly assigned for FUP exhibited slower increases in rates of foster placement following housing intervention compared with families referred for housing advocacy alone. The program generates average savings of nearly $500 per family per year to the foster care system. Housing subsidies provide the foster care system small but significant benefits for keeping homeless families together. Findings inform the design of a coordinated child welfare response to housing insecurity.

N2  - Posttraumatic stress symptoms are a pressing issue among women experiencing incarceration and homelessness. Baseline data were collected among formerly incarcerated homeless women (N&thinsp;=&thinsp;130) who were on average 38.9 (SD = 11.36, range 19-64) years of age and recruited into a pilot randomized control trial (RCT) intervention program. A logistic regression was used to assess correlates of PTSD symptoms. The majority of the sample self-reported witnessing violence (85%) and had moderate PTSD symptoms (M&thinsp;=&thinsp;1.61, SD = 1.62, range: 0-4). No past month drug use (p&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.006), higher anger scores (p&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.002), greater emotional support (p&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.009), and psychological frailty (p&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.02) were significantly associated with higher odds of PTSD symptoms. Moreover, women who experienced minor family conflicts had lower odds of PTSD symptoms relative to those that had family conflicts most of the time (p&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.02). Similarly, controlling for all other variables, women who had a higher positive social interaction score also had lower odds of PTSD symptoms (p&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.006). These findings are a call to action for academicians, service providers, and health practitioners to develop an intervention which integrates comprehensive PTSD screening, and discussion of ways to build coping skills, relationships with family and social networks, and utilizes a trauma-informed approach during reentry.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Homelessness is associated with increased prevalence of mental health disorders, substance use disorders and mental health/substance use disorder comorbidity in the United States of America. Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) living in the United States are at increased risk for homelessness, and have also evidenced elevated mental health and substance use disorder prevalence relative to their non-MSM male counterparts., DESIGN AND METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from a randomised controlled trial estimating the diagnostic prevalence of substance use/mental health disorder comorbidity among a sample of homeless, substance-dependent MSM (DSM-IV verified; n&thinsp;=&thinsp;131)., RESULTS: The most prevalent substance use/mental health disorder comorbidities were stimulant dependence comorbid with at least one depressive disorder (28%), alcohol dependence comorbid with at least one depressive disorder (26%) and stimulant dependence comorbid with antisocial personality disorder (25%)., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic depression and antisocial personality disorder both demonstrated high rates of prevalence among homeless, substance-dependent (particularly stimulant and alcohol dependent) MSM.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We compared the US-derived Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) home visiting programme when added to usually provided health and social care for first-time teenage mothers, to usual care alone. We aimed to: establish the nature of usual care, measure service usage and assess performance bias in core usual care services., DESIGN: Within trial process evaluation. Local professionals completed a survey mapping local health and social care services in seven domains. This focused on services available to young women, especially those relevant to pregnant teenagers. Descriptive data were assessed thematically to establish the range of services. Quantitative data collection with FNP supervisors enumerated service provision by site. Services identified were included in main participant trial follow-up interviews at four time points to quantify usage. Usage was described descriptively by domain. We explored predictors of health visitor visits., SETTING: 18 partnerships of local authority and healthcare organisations in England., OUTCOMES: Descriptive framework of services. Rates of service usage reported by trial participants., RESULTS: 161 separate services were identified, with multiple service models in each domain, broadly categorised as universal or specialist (eg, for teenage mothers). FNP supervisors identified 30-63 universal services per site and 22-67 specialist services. Use of core maternity care services was similar across trial arms and with only small differences in use of health visiting services. Participants accessed a wide range of services. Women who had ever been homeless, who had a higher subjectively defined social status, and poorer mental health received more visits from a health visitor., CONCLUSIONS: The large number of services available to teenage mothers in England may limit the incremental benefit achievable through enhanced home visiting. There was little evidence of compensatory practice, such as additional care for women in the usual care arm. Measuring usual care when trialling complex interventions is challenging and essential., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN23019866.

N2  - Homeless young adults ages 18-25 exhibit high rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use, and sexual risk behaviors such as unprotected sex. Yet few programs exist for this population that are both effective and can be easily incorporated into settings serving this population. This pilot cluster cross-over randomized controlled trial evaluates AWARE, a voluntary four session group-based motivational interviewing (MI) intervention to reduce AOD use and sexual risk behavior. We evaluated AWARE with 200 homeless young adults using drop-in center services in Los Angeles County (mean age=21.8years; 73% male; 79% heterosexual; 31% non-Hispanic White, 25% African American, 24% Hispanic, 21% multiracial/other). Surveys were completed at baseline and three months after program completion. Retention in the AWARE program was excellent (79% attended multiple sessions) and participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the program. AWARE participants self-reported positive change in their past 3month and past 30day alcohol use (ps&les;0.05), motivation to change drug use (ps<0.05), and condom use self-efficacy (p=0.05) compared to the control group. Among those with multiple sex partners, AWARE participants showed a decrease in unprotected sexual events (p<0.05), whereas the control group did not. Results from this pilot evaluation are promising, suggesting that a brief group-MI risk reduction intervention can be effective in helping homeless young adults make positive changes in their alcohol and condom use. Further work is needed to more fully evaluate the efficacy of AWARE on AOD behavior and sexual risk behavior outcomes.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Smoking rates are alarmingly high among young people experiencing homelessness (YEH), yet there are no evidence-based cessation programs for this population. This paper presents results from a pilot evaluation of a text messaging-based smoking cessation treatment, as an adjunct to brief group cessation counseling, to improve abstinence rates among 18-25-year-old smokers experiencing homelessness. The goal of this study was to estimate effect sizes for a larger trial and it was not powered to detect group differences., AIMS AND METHODS: YEH smokers who had a working cell phone with them at recruitment were randomized to receive a group counseling session, nicotine patches, and written material on quitting (n = 37) or a similar program that also included a 6-week automated text messaging intervention (TMI) to provide ongoing support for quitting (n = 40). Smoking outcomes were evaluated through a 90-day follow-up., RESULTS: Seven-day point prevalence abstinence at 90-day follow-up was higher in the TMI condition than standard condition (17.50% vs. 8.11%, respectively; Cohen's h = .37); however, the 90-day continuous abstinence rate was not statistically different from zero in either condition. Reductions in the number of days smoked in the past 30 days from baseline to follow-up were greater in the TMI condition than the standard condition (-14.24 vs. -8.62, respectively; Cohen's d = .49)., CONCLUSIONS: Adding a 6-week TMI support to a brief group counseling and pharmacotherapy protocol holds promise for smoking reduction and abstinence among YEH smokers. Results indicate that further development and evaluation of the TMI in this population is warranted., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03874585. Registered March 14, 2019, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03874585., IMPLICATIONS: This is the first study to evaluate the feasibility of using a text messaging-based intervention (TMI) for behavior change with 18-25 year olds experiencing homelessness, and more specifically, the first to test a TMI to provide ongoing support for smoking cessation. Small to medium effect sizes for the TMI are promising in terms of implementing a TMI using participants' own cell phones, as well as the efficacy of this approach as an adjunct to standard care (brief group counseling and pharmacotherapy) for smoking cessation among YEH.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We examined the efficacy of the Healthy Living Program in reducing risky sexual behavior and substance use among adults with HIV infection who were marginally housed (i.e., homeless at some point over a 37-month period)., METHODS: We had previously conducted a randomized controlled trial with 936 adults living with HIV infection. In that study, 3 intervention modules of 5 sessions each addressed different goals: reducing risky sexual acts and drug use, improving the quality of life, and adhering to healthful behaviors. Participants were interviewed at baseline and at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 months; 746 completed 4 or more assessments. In this study, we analyzed sexual behavior and drug use outcomes for the 35% (n = 270 of 767) of participants who were considered marginally housed., RESULTS: Among the marginally housed participants, there were significantly greater reductions in unprotected risky sexual acts, the number of sexual partners of HIV negative or unknown serostatus, alcohol or marijuana use, and hard drug use among the intervention group than among the control group., CONCLUSIONS: Intensive, skill-focused intervention programs may improve the lives of marginally housed adults living with HIV infection.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The CTN-0067 CHOICES trial tests implementation of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) versus treatment-as-usual (TAU) for opioid use disorders (OUD) in HIV clinics to improve HIV viral suppression. The study team investigated recruitment strategies to elucidate the barriers and facilitators to recruitment and enrollment in the study., MAIN TEXT: Methods: Semi-structured, in-depth, digitally recorded interviews were completed with study recruitment-related staff and medical providers (n =&thinsp;26) from six participating HIV clinics in the fall of 2018. Interviews probed 1) factors that might prevent prospective participants from engaging in study recruitment and enrollment procedures and 2) strategies used by study staff that encourage eligible patient participation. Interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed using a content analysis approach., RESULTS: All respondents reported that barriers to recruitment and enrollment included challenging patient social and structural factors (e.g., homelessness or living environments with high substance use, criminal justice involvement), difficulty locating patients with unsuppressed HIV viral load and OUD within the HIV clinic, time-consuming study enrollment processes, and stigma around HIV and OUD which inhibited treatment seeking. Some respondents observed that distrust of research and researchers impeded recruitment activities in the community. A specific medication-related barrier was patient fear of opioid abstinence required prior to XR-NTX induction. Facilitators of recruitment included use of trusted peer outreach/recruitment workers in the community, hospitalizations that offered windows of opportunities for screening and XR-NTX induction, providing participant transportation, and partnerships with harm reduction organizations for referrals., CONCLUSIONS: Though study personnel encountered barriers to recruitment in the CHOICES study, persons with untreated HIV and OUD can be enrolled in multisite clinical trials by using enhanced recruitment strategies that extend outside of the HIV clinic. Employing peer outreach workers and collaborating with syringe service programs may be especially helpful in facilitating recruitment and merit inclusion in similar study protocols.

N2  - This randomized pilot study tested the efficacy of an integrative treatment targeting homeless substance abusing mothers with young children in their care. Sixty mothers with 2-6 year old children were recruited from a local family shelter. The mothers were randomly assigned to Ecologically-Based Treatment (n=30) or treatment as usual (n=30). The intervention group received 3 months of rental and utility assistance up to $600 per month, case management services, and substance abuse counseling (referred to as supportive services). The treatment as usual group received housing and services through the family shelter and community housing programs. All participants completed follow-up assessments at 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Mothers receiving Ecologically-Based Treatment showed a quicker decline in alcohol frequency and a quicker increase in housing stability. Furthermore, with supportive services, two-thirds of women were successful in maintaining their apartments 6 months after rental assistance ended.

N2  - Shelter data in a recent study revealed discharges from psychiatric facilities to shelters or the street occurred at least 194 times in 2002 in London, Ontario, Canada. This problem must be addressed to reduce the disastrous effects of such discharge, including re-hospitalization and prolonged homelessness. An intervention was developed and tested to prevent homelessness associated with discharge directly to no fixed address. A total of 14 participants at-risk of being discharged without housing were enrolled, with half randomized into the intervention group. The intervention group was provided with immediate assistance in accessing housing and assistance in paying their first and last month's rent. The control group received usual care. Data was collected from participants prior to discharge, at 31 and 6-months post-discharge. All the individuals in the intervention group maintained housing after 3 and 6 months. All but one individual in the control group remained homeless after 3 and 6 months. The exception joined the sex trade to avoid homelessness. The results of this pilot were so dramatic that randomizing to the control group was discontinued. Discussions are underway to routinely implement the intervention. Systemic improvements can prevent homelessness for individuals being discharged from psychiatric wards.

N2  - Despite the increase in consumer-driven interventions for homeless and mentally ill individuals, there is little evidence that these programs enhance psychological outcomes. This study followed 197 homeless and mentally ill adults who were randomized into one of two conditions: a consumer-driven "Housing First" program or "treatment as usual" requiring psychiatric treatment and sobriety before housing. Proportion of time homeless, perceived choice, mastery, and psychiatric symptoms were measured at six time points. Results indicate a direct relationship between Housing First and decreased homelessness and increased perceived choice; the effect of choice on psychiatric symptoms was partially mediated by mastery. The strong and inverse relationship between perceived choice and psychiatric symptoms supports expansion of programs that increase consumer choice, thereby enhancing mastery and decreasing psychiatric symptoms.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Young people experiencing homelessness have alarmingly high rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use, which is associated with sexual risk behaviors such as unprotected sex, trading sex, and sex with multiple casual partners. Few risk reduction programs for this population have been developed and rigorously evaluated, particularly those that address both of these interrelated behaviors, use a collaborative and non-judgmental approach, and are feasible to deliver in settings where homeless young people seek services. This paper describes the protocol of a study evaluating a four-session Motivational Interviewing (MI)-based group risk reduction intervention for this population. The protocol has been shown to be efficacious in pilot work over 3 months with 200 homeless young adults [1]. The current study seeks to refine the intervention protocol and evaluate the program on a larger scale. METHODS/DESIGN: In a cluster-cross-over randomized controlled trial, 18-25 year olds will receive the AWARE risk reduction program (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;200) or standard care (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;200) at one of three drop-in centers serving homeless youth in the Los Angeles area. We will evaluate intervention effects on primary outcomes of AOD use and sexual risk behavior, as well as secondary outcomes of health-related quality of life and social stability, over a 12-month period. DISCUSSION: This project has the potential to fill a significant gap in prevention services by demonstrating that a brief intervention, feasible to deliver within settings where young people experiencing homelessness typically seeks services, can significantly reduce the interrelated problems of AOD use and sexual risk behavior.

N2  - HIV prevention interventions that reduce sexual risk behaviors among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM), the most severely affected population in the United States, are critical for reducing disparities in HIV infection. However, there are few theory-based sexual risk reduction interventions designed specifically for YBMSM. This study tested the applicability of the Integrated Behavioral Model (IBM), which theorizes that behavioral intentions mediate the relationship between psychosocial constructs and health behavior on condomless anal intercourse (CAI) among YBMSM. To test key constructs of the IBM, analyses were conducted with baseline data from the HealthMpowerment (HMP) randomized controlled trial. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationships between condom use self-efficacy, norms, attitudes, intentions, and environmental constraints, and CAI. Mediation analysis was conducted to determine if condom use intentions mediated the relationship between psychosocial constructs (i.e., condom use self-efficacy, norms, and attitudes) and CAI. Overall 55.7% reported one or more acts of CAI with a male partner in the past 3 months. Those who reported CAI in the 3 months prior to the baseline survey reported lower self-efficacy for condom use, lower condom use norms, more negative attitudes toward condom use, and lower condom use intentions at baseline than those who reported no CAI. In mediation analysis, the relationships between CAI and self-efficacy for condom use (estimated indirect effect&thinsp;=&thinsp;-0.004 (SE&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.002)), condom use norms (-0.002 (SE&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.001)) and attitudes toward condom use (-0.005 (SE&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.002)) were mediated by condom use intentions. This study applied the IBM to sexual risk behavior among a sample of YBMSM. Results indicate that the relationships between condom use self-efficacy, norms, and attitudes, and CAI were mediated by condom use intentions. Future theory-informed interventions should focus on increasing self-efficacy for condom use, condom use norms, attitudes toward condom use, and condom use intentions to reduce CAI among YBMSM.

N2  - Background: People experiencing homelessness have higher rates of HIV than those who are stably housed. Mental health needs, substance use problems, and issues unique to homelessness such as lack of shelter and transiency need to be considered with regard to HIV prevention. To date, HIV prevention interventions for young adults experiencing homelessness have not specifically addressed modifiable real-time factors such as stress, sexual or drug use urge, or substance use, or been delivered at the time of heightened risk. Real-time, personalized HIV prevention messages may reduce HIV risk behaviors. Objective: This pilot study tested the initial efficacy of an innovative, smartphone-based, just-in-time adaptive intervention that assessed predictors of HIV risk behaviors in real time and automatically provided behavioral feedback and goal attainment information. Methods: A randomized attention control design was used among young adults experiencing homelessness, aged 18-25 years, recruited from shelters and drop-in centers in May 2019. Participants were randomized to either a control or an intervention group. The intervention (called MY-RID [Motivating Youth to Reduce Infection and Disconnection]) consisted of brief messages delivered via smartphone over 6 weeks in response to preidentified predictors that were assessed using ecological momentary assessments. Bayesian hierarchical regression models were used to assess intervention effects on sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, and their corresponding urges. Results: Participants (N=97) were predominantly youth (mean age 21.2, SD 2.1 years) who identified as heterosexual (n=51, 52%), male (n=56, 57%), and African American (n=56, 57%). Reports of sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, stress, and all urges (ie, sexual, drug, alcohol) reduced over time in both groups. Daily drug use reduced by a factor of 13.8 times over 6 weeks in the intervention group relative to the control group (Multimedia Appendix 4). Lower urges for sex were found in the intervention group relative to the control group over the duration of the study. Finally, there was a statistically significant reduction in reports of feeling stressed the day before between the intervention and control conditions (P=.03). Conclusions: Findings indicate promising intervention effects on drug use, stress, and urges for sex in a hard-to-reach, high-risk population. The MY-RID intervention should be further tested in a larger randomized controlled trial to further investigate its efficacy and impact on sexual risk behaviors.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and sociodemographic factors associated with food insecurity in the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia., DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of food insecurity data collected by the NSW Population Health Survey between 2003 and 2014. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine associations with key sociodemographic variables., SETTING: NSW, Australia., PARTICIPANTS: 212 608 survey participants responded to the food insecurity survey question between 2003 and 2014. 150 767 of them were aged &ge;16 years. The survey sample was randomly selected and weighted to be representative of the NSW population., RESULTS: On average 6 % of adults aged &ge;16 years experienced food insecurity in NSW. The odds of food insecurity appeared to increase from one survey year to the next by a factor of 1&middot;05. Food insecurity was found to be independently associated with age, sex, marital status, household size, education, employment status, household income, smoking status, alcohol intake and self-rated health. The association with income, smoking status and self-rated health appeared to be the strongest among all covariates and showed a gradient effect. Food insecurity appeared to increase significantly between the age of 16 and 19 years., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of food insecurity appears to be rising over time. Given the negative health consequences of food insecurity, more rigorous measurement and monitoring of food insecurity in NSW and nationally is strongly recommended. The findings provide support for interventions targeting low-income and younger population groups.

N2  - When nurses possess negative attitudes toward people with low socio-economic status it can negatively influence patient care. This study examines whether providing care in a service-learning environment positively affects nursing students' world views and empathy toward the poor. Using a pre-post design, the Attitudes about Poverty and Poor People Scale and the Just World Scale were administered to both a control group and nursing students engaged in a clinical rotation at a low-income housing facility or homeless shelter in spring and fall 2010. Findings show the service learning treatment modestly enhanced empathy and students' views on justice, while not improving superficial perceptions of the poor.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Individuals experiencing homelessness are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity. The At Home/Chez Soi study provides a unique opportunity to first examine baseline levels of food security among homeless individuals with mental illness and second to evaluate the effect of a Housing First (HF) intervention on food security in this population., DESIGN: At Home/Chez Soi was a 2-year randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of HF compared with usual care among homeless adults with mental illness, stratified by level of need for mental health services (high or moderate). Logistic regressions tested baseline associations between food security (US Food Security Survey Module), study site, sociodemographic variables, duration of homelessness, alcohol/substance use, physical health and service utilization. Negative binomial regression determined the impact of the HF intervention on achieving levels of high or marginal food security over an 18-month follow-up period (6 to 24 months)., SETTING: Community settings at five Canadian sites (Moncton, Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver)., SUBJECTS: Homeless adults with mental illness (n 2148)., RESULTS: Approximately 41 % of our sample reported high or marginal food security at baseline, but this figure varied with gender, age, mental health issues and substance use problems. High need participants who received HF were more likely to achieve marginal or high food security than those receiving usual care, but only at the Toronto and Moncton sites., CONCLUSIONS: Our large multi-site study demonstrated low levels of food security among homeless experiencing mental illness. HF showed promise for improving food security among participants with high levels of need for mental health services, with notable site differences.

N2  - A longitudinal randomized controlled trial tested whether access to permanent housing reduces child maltreatment among inadequately housed families under investigation for child abuse and neglect. The study followed homeless and child welfare-involved families randomly assigned to receive a referral for housing subsidies plus housing case management (n = 75, 196 children) or housing case management alone (n = 75, 186 children). Latent growth models examined change in caregiver-reported frequencies of psychological aggression, physical abuse, and neglect toward children at five time points across 2.5 years. Intent-to-treat analyses suggested treatment differences for minor assault and neglect that approached significance; families randomly assigned to permanent housing plus case management exhibited marginally greater declines compared to families referred for housing case management only. Caregiver psychological aggression remained high over time, regardless of treatment condition. No evidence indicated higher risk families benefitted more from permanent housing. Results show some promise of permanent housing and highlight the complex needs of homeless families under investigation for child maltreatment. Findings emphasize the importance of continued involvement from the child welfare system to connect families with important resources.

N2  - Elevated prevalence estimates of sexually transmitted infections and sexual risk behaviors have commonly been reported among homeless and precariously housed adults. Research has increasingly recognized the importance and impact of structural factors, such as housing, on risk behaviors. Several researchers have argued that supported housing interventions, such as Housing First (HF), may contribute to reductions in sexual risk behavior. The present study is the first analysis of a randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of HF on unprotected sex among formerly homeless and marginally housed adults with mental illness and complex comorbidities., METHODS: Generalized estimating equations were used to examine between-group differences in unprotected sex., RESULTS: Compared with treatment as usual, no association was found between HF and unprotected sex over the 24 months of follow-up. Several other variables were significantly and independently associated with unprotected sex., CONCLUSION: Results suggest that further interventions are needed to reduce unprotected sex among homeless and unstably housed individuals with mental illness.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Brazil is among the nations with the greatest rates of annual cocaine usage. Pharmacological treatment of cocaine addiction is still limited, opening space for nonconventional interventions. Homeopathic Q-potencies of opium and Erythroxylum coca have been tested in the integrative treatment of cocaine craving among homeless addicts, but this setting had not proven feasible, due to insufficient recruitment., OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the effectiveness and tolerability of homeopathic Q-potencies of opium and E. coca in the integrative treatment of cocaine craving in a community-based psychosocial rehabilitation setting., DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, eight-week pilot trial was performed at the Psychosocial Attention Center for Alcohol and Other Drugs (CAPS-AD), Sao Carlos/SP, Brazil. Eligible subjects included CAPS-AD patients between 18 and 65years of age, with an International Classification of Diseases-10 diagnosis of cocaine dependence (F14.2). The patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: psychosocial rehabilitation plus homeopathic Q-potencies of opium and E. coca (homeopathy group), and psychosocial rehabilitation plus indistinguishable placebo (placebo group)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was the percentage of cocaine-using days. Secondary measures were the Minnesota Cocaine Craving Scale and 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey scores. Adverse events were reported in both groups., RESULTS: The study population comprised 54 patients who attended at least one post-baseline assessment, out of the 104 subjects initially enrolled. The mean percentage of cocaine-using days in the homeopathy group was 18.1% (standard deviation (SD): 22.3%), compared to 29.8% (SD: 30.6%) in the placebo group (P<0.01). Analysis of the Minnesota Cocaine Craving Scale scores showed no between-group differences in the intensity of cravings, but results significantly favored homeopathy over placebo in the proportion of weeks without craving episodes and the patients' appraisal of treatment efficacy for reduction of cravings. Analysis of 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey scores found no significant differences. Few adverse events were reported: 0.57 adverse events/patient in the homeopathy group compared to 0.69 adverse events/patient in the placebo group (P=0.41)., CONCLUSIONS: A psychosocial rehabilitation setting improved recruitment but was not sufficient to decrease dropout frequency among Brazilian cocaine treatment seekers. Psychosocial rehabilitation plus homeopathic Q-potencies of opium and E. coca were more effective than psychosocial rehabilitation alone in reducing cocaine cravings. Due to high dropout rate and risk of bias, further research is required to confirm our findings, with specific focus on strategies to increase patient retention., TRIAL REGISTRATION: RBR-2xzcwz (http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br).

N2  - PROBLEM: Street-involved youth experience a range of mental health problems with elevated rates of psychiatric disorders compared with non-homeless youth. The overall objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of a relationship-based intervention for homeless youth receiving services from agencies in downtown Toronto., METHODS: The final sample included 15 homeless youth who met the study inclusion criteria. The intervention and comparison groups were compared at baseline and post-treatment on measures of mental health symptoms, hopelessness, self-esteem, resilience, and social connectedness., FINDINGS: Participants receiving the intervention demonstrated a significant improvement in social connectedness, with a trend toward decreased hopelessness. Those participants who did not receive the intervention did not demonstrate any improvements in social connectedness and hopelessness., CONCLUSION: This preliminary pilot study suggests that providing a relationship-based intervention to street-involved youth may offer promise to strengthen social relationships and to mitigate overwhelming hopelessness and despair.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The study examined two-year housing outcomes of homeless mentally ill clients who took part in an experimental investigation of supported housing. The relationships between housing outcomes and client characteristics, such as gender, psychiatric diagnosis, and substance use, were of primary interest., METHODS: A two-factor, longitudinal design was used. Homeless clients in San Diego County who were diagnosed as having chronic and severe mental illness were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions. Half of the clients were given better access to independent housing through Section 8 rent subsidy certificates. All clients received flexible case management, but half were provided more comprehensive case management services. The housing of each individual over a two-year period was classified in one of three categories: stable independent housing, stable housing in another setting in the community, or unstable housing., RESULTS: Clients with access to Section 8 housing certificates were much more likely to achieve independent housing than clients without access to Section 8 certificates, but no differences emerged across the two different levels of case management. Housing stability was strongly mediated by several covariates, especially the presence of problems with drugs or alcohol., CONCLUSIONS: Supported housing interventions can be very successful tools for stabilizing homeless mentally ill individuals in independent community settings. Advantages include the low level of restrictiveness of these settings and the preference of many clients for independent housing. However, the success of supported housing projects is likely to depend strongly on the specific characteristics of the population being served.

N2  - Background: Economic vulnerability, such as homelessness and unemployment, contributes to the HIV risk among racial minorities in the U.S., who are disproportionately infected. Yet, few economic-strengthening interventions have been adapted for HIV prevention in economically-vulnerable African-American young adults. Engaging Microenterprise for Resource Generation and Health Empowerment (EMERGE) is a feasibility randomized clinical trial of an HIV prevention microenterprise intervention with integrated text messages ("nudges") that are informed by behavioral economic principles. The trial aims to reduce sexual risk behaviors and increase employment and uptake of HIV preventive behaviors. Methods/design: In total, 40 young adults who are African-American, aged 18-24, live in Baltimore City, have experienced at least one episode of homelessness in the last 12 months, are unemployed or underemployed (fewer than 10 h per week), are not enrolled in school, own a cell phone with text messaging, and report at least one episode of unprotected or unsafe sex in the prior 12 months will be recruited from two community-based organizations providing residential supportive services to urban youth. Participants will undergo a 3-week run-in period and thereafter be randomly assigned to one of two groups with active interventions for 20 weeks. The first group ("comparison") will receive text messages with information on job openings. The second group ("experimental") will receive text messages with information on job openings plus information on HIV prevention and business educational sessions, a mentored apprenticeship, and a start-up grant, and business and HIV prevention text messages based on principles from behavioral economics. The two primary outcomes relate to the feasibility of conducting a larger trial. Secondary outcomes relate to employment, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV preventive practices. All participants will be assessed using an in-person questionnaire at pre-intervention (prior to randomization) and at 3 weeks post-intervention. To obtain repeated, longitudinal measures, participants will be assessed weekly using text message surveys from pre-intervention up to 3 weeks post-intervention. Discussion: This study will be one of the first U.S.-based feasibility randomized clinical trials of an HIV prevention microenterprise intervention for economically-vulnerable African-American young adults. The findings will inform whether and how to conduct a larger efficacy trial for HIV risk reduction in this population. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03766165.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Researchers have pointed out the paucity of research investigating long-term consequences of experiencing homelessness in childhood or youth. Limited research has indicated that the experience of homelessness in childhood or youth is associated with adverse adjustment-related consequences in adulthood. Housing First (HF) has acknowledged effectiveness in improving housing outcomes among adults experiencing homelessness and living with serious mental illness, although some HF clients struggle with maintaining housing. The current study was conducted to examine whether the experience of homelessness in childhood or youth increases the odds of poorer housing stability following entry into high-fidelity HF among adults experiencing serious mental illness and who were formerly homeless., METHODS: Data were drawn from the active intervention arms of a HF randomized controlled trial in Metro Vancouver, Canada. Participants (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;297) were referred to the study from service agencies serving adults experiencing homelessness and mental illness between October 2009 and June 2011. The Residential Time-Line Follow-Back Inventory was used to measure housing stability. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to estimate the association between first experiencing homelessness in childhood or youth and later housing stability as an adult in HF., RESULTS: Analyses indicated that homelessness in childhood or youth was negatively associated with experiencing housing stability as an adult in HF (aOR&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.53; 95% CI&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.31-0.90)., CONCLUSIONS: Further supports are needed within HF to increase housing stability among adult clients who have experienced homelessness in childhood or youth. Asking clients about the age they first experienced homelessness may be of clinical utility upon enrollment in HF and may help identify support needs related to developmental experiences. Results further emphasize the importance of intervening earlier in life in childhood and youth before experiencing homelessness or before it becomes chronic. Findings also contribute to a limited knowledge base regarding the adverse long-term consequences of childhood and youth homelessness., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN57595077 and ISRCTN66721740 .

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Limited research has evaluated the efficacy of suicide prevention interventions among homeless youth, especially considering how their connectedness with their family would impact treatment outcomes., METHOD: Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) between the ages of 18-24 years were recruited from a local drop-in center. Youth were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or Treatment as Usual alone. Youth reported their family network satisfaction at the baseline assessment, whereas their suicidal ideation, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness were assessed at baseline and three additional times during a nine-month period., RESULTS: A multiple-group autoregressive cross-lagged model suggests that CTSP was associated with lower suicidal ideation and lower thwarted belongingness only among those with high family network satisfaction. Among both groups, perceived burdensomeness predicted higher suicidal ideation, which in turn predicted lower perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. Additionally, only among youth with low family network satisfaction, thwarted belongingness predicted lower suicidal ideation., CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that family network satisfaction may be an important factor when considering cognitive interventions with homeless youth, with implications to improve treatment efforts and to reduce premature mortality, hospitalization and loss of human capital in a very high-risk population.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the voice performance of children involved in street labor with regular children using perceptual-auditory and acoustic analyses., METHODS: A controlled cross-sectional study was carried out on 7- to 10-year-old children of both genders. Children from both groups lived with their families and attended school regularly; however, child labor was evident in one group and not the other. A total of 200 potentially eligible street children, assisted by the Child Labor Elimination Programme (PETI), and 400 regular children were interviewed. Those with any vocal discomfort (106, 53% and 90, 22.5%) had their voices assessed for resonance, pitch, loudness, speech rate, maximum phonation time, and other acoustic measurements., RESULTS: A total of 106 street children (study group [SG]) and 90 regular children (control group [CG]) were evaluated. The SG group demonstrated higher oral and nasal resonance, reduced loudness, a lower pitch, and a slower speech rate than the CG. The maximum phonation time, fundamental frequency, and upper harmonics were higher in the SG than the CG. Jitter and shimmer were higher in the CG than the SG., CONCLUSION: Using perceptual-auditory and acoustic analyses, we determined that there were differences in voice performance between the two groups, with street children having better quality perceptual and acoustic vocal parameters than regular children. We believe that this is due to the procedures and activities performed by the Child Labor Elimination Program (PETI), which helps children to cope with their living conditions.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study compares the effect of Housing First on older (&ge;50 years old) and younger (18-49 years old) homeless adults with mental illness participating in At Home/Chez Soi, a 24-month multisite randomized controlled trial of Housing First., METHOD: At Home/Chez Soi, participants (n = 2148) were randomized to receive rent supplements with intensive case management or assertive community treatment, based on their need level for mental health services, or usual care in their respective communities. A subgroup analysis compared older (n = 470) and younger (n = 1678) homeless participants across baseline characteristics and 24-month outcomes including housing stability (primary outcome), generic and condition-specific quality of life, community functioning, physical and mental health status, mental health symptom severity, psychological community integration, recovery, and substance use (secondary outcomes)., RESULTS: At 24 months, Housing First significantly improved the percentage of days stably housed among older (+43.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 38.4% to 49.5%) and younger homeless adults (+39.7%, 95% CI: 36.8% to 42.6%), compared with usual care, with no significant differences between age groups (difference of differences = +4.2%, 95% CI: -2.1% to 10.5%, p = 0.188). Improvements from baseline to 24 months in mental health and condition-specific quality of life were significantly greater among older homeless adults than among younger homeless adults., CONCLUSION: Housing First significantly improved housing stability among older and younger homeless adults with mental illness, resulting in superior mental health and quality of life outcomes in older homeless adults compared with younger homeless adults at 24 months.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Smoking rates are significantly higher among young people experiencing homelessness than in the general population. Despite a willingness to quit, homeless youth have little success in doing so on their own, and existing cessation resources tailored to this population are lacking. Homeless youth generally enjoy the camaraderie and peer support that group-based programs offer, but continuous in-person support during a quit attempt can be prohibitively expensive., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an automated text messaging intervention (TMI) as an adjunct to group-based cessation counseling and provision of nicotine patches to help homeless youth quit smoking. This paper outlines the lessons learned from the implementation of the TMI intervention., METHODS: Homeless youth smokers aged 18 to 25 years who were interested in quitting (n=77) were recruited from drop-in centers serving homeless youth in the Los Angeles area. In this pilot randomized controlled trial, all participants received a group-based cessation counseling session and nicotine patches, with 52% (40/77) randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of text messages to provide additional support for their quit attempt. Participants received text messages on their own phone rather than receiving a study-issued phone for the TMI. We analyzed baseline and follow-up survey data as well as back-end data from the messaging platform to gauge the acceptability and feasibility of the TMI among the 40 participants who received it., RESULTS: Participants had widespread (smart)phone ownership-16.4% (36/219) were ineligible for study participation because they did not have a phone that could receive text messages. Participants experienced interruptions in their phone use (eg, 44% [16/36] changed phone numbers during the follow-up period) but reported being able to receive the majority of messages. These survey results were corroborated by back-end data (from the program used to administer the TMI) showing a message delivery rate of about 95%. Participant feedback points to the importance of carefully crafting text messages, which led to high (typically above 70%) approval of most text messaging components of the intervention. Qualitative feedback indicated that participants enjoyed the group counseling session that preceded the TMI and suggested including more such group elements into the intervention., CONCLUSIONS: The TMI was well accepted and feasible to support smoking cessation among homeless youth. Given high rates of smartphone ownership, the next generation of phone-based smoking cessation interventions for this population should consider using approaches beyond text messages and focus on finding ways to develop effective approaches to include group interaction using remote implementation. Given overall resource constraints and in particular the exigencies of the currently ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, phone-based interventions are a promising approach to support homeless youth, a population urgently in need of effective smoking cessation interventions., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03874585; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03874585., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR2-10.1186/s13722-020-00187-6.

N2  - PURPOSE: To increase the number of high-risk and homeless youth who receive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test results and posttest counseling., METHODS: Oral HIV testing and counseling were offered to high-risk and homeless youth at sites at which youth congregate throughout Portland, Oregon. Subjects were randomized to receive test results and posttest counseling either in a face-to-face manner or with the option of telephone notification. Self-reported demographic and risk-behavior information was collected prior to HIV testing. The differences in the proportion of youth who received their test results were analyzed according to the notification method and demographic characteristics using SPSS., RESULTS: Among the 351 youth who were tested, 48% followed up to receive test results and posttest counseling. Adolescents most likely to receive their results were female, older (19-24 years), and white and those who reported high-risk behaviors. Those given the option of telephone notification were significantly more likely to receive their results than those required to have face-to-face notification (odds ratio = 2.301, 95% confidence interval of 1.499, 3.534). This was true regardless of age, race, history of previous HIV testing, or presence of high-risk behaviors. Two youths tested positive for HIV corroborating previous reports of low HIV prevalence in this population. Both were assigned to the face-to-face notification group and, therefore, no HIV positive results were given by telephone., CONCLUSIONS: The option of telephone notification significantly increased the proportion of youth who received posttest counseling and results following community-based testing.

N2  - Emergency shelters are a core component of homeless service systems that address immediate basic needs. Service bans, which refer to temporary or permanent disallowances from a program or organization, are an underresearched phenomenon that can leave people experiencing homelessness without needed supports. This exploratory study examined the factors associated with shelter bans among people experiencing homelessness using secondary data from two Canadian studies: (1) a multisite randomized controlled trial of Housing First (At Home/Chez Soi Demonstration Project) and (2) a cross-sectional survey of youth experiencing homelessness across Canada (2019 Without a Home-National Youth Homelessness Survey). The two datasets were analyzed separately using logistic regression models with similar predictors to maximize the comparability of the results. Participants who experienced homelessness at an earlier age and had recent criminal justice system involvement were more likely to have shelter bans in both datasets. Impaired impulse control, more chronic medical conditions and living in Toronto were associated with increased likelihood of shelter bans in the At Home/Chez Soi dataset, whereas more adverse childhood experiences, physical violence victimization, engagement in survival sex behaviours and longer current episodes of homelessness were significant predictors of bans in the Without A Home dataset. Overall, the findings suggest that victimization and criminalization during homelessness may increase the risk of shelter loss from bans and further exclusion. The observed regional differences also highlight the potential limits of individual-level predictors. Further research is needed on shelter ban outcomes, as well as how capacity limits and organizational policies affect banning decisions.

N2  - While research on homeless adolescents and young adults evidencing substance use disorder is increasing, there is a dearth of information regarding effective interventions, and more research is needed to guide those who serve this population. The current study builds upon prior research showing promising findings of the community reinforcement approach (CRA) (Slesnick, Prestopnik, Meyers, & Glassman, 2007). Homeless adolescents and young adults between the ages of 14 to 20. years were randomized to one of three theoretically distinct interventions: (1) CRA (. n=. 93), (2) motivational enhancement therapy (MET, n=. 86), or (3) case management (CM, n=. 91). The relative effectiveness of these interventions was evaluated at 3, 6, and 12. months post-baseline. Findings indicated that substance use and associated problems were significantly reduced in all three interventions across time. Several moderating effects were found, especially for sex and history of childhood abuse. Findings show little evidence of superiority or inferiority of the three interventions and suggest that drop-in centers have choices for addressing the range of problems that these adolescents and young adults face.

N2  - Runaway youth report a broader range and higher severity of substance-related, mental health and family problems relative to non-runaway youth. Most studies to date have collected self-report data on the family and social history; virtually no research has examined treatment effectiveness with this population. This study is a treatment development project in which 124 runaway youth were randomly assigned to (1) ecologically based family therapy (EBFT) or (2) service as usual (SAU) through a shelter. Youth completed an intake, posttreatment, 6 and 12 months follow-up assessment. Youth assigned to EBFT reported greater reductions in overall substance abuse compared to youth assigned to SAU while other problem areas improved in both conditions. Findings suggest that EBFT is an efficacious intervention for this relatively severe population of youth.

N2  - Two recent randomized controlled efficacy trials showed that harm-reduction treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD)-or patient-driven treatment that does not require abstinence and instead supports decreased alcohol-related harm and improved quality of life (QoL)-is efficacious for adults experiencing homelessness and AUD. The present study provides qualitative and quantitative analysis of one component of harm-reduction treatment, participants' harm-reduction goal-setting, within these two trials. Aims of this secondary, dual-trial study (Trial 1 N = 208, Trial 2 N = 86) were to describe participant-generated harm-reduction goals and determine whether aspects of harm-reduction goal-setting predict treatment outcomes. Across both trials, qualitative findings indicated improving QoL, meeting basic needs, improving physical and mental health, and changing drinking behavior were participants' top four goals. Only 2%-6% of goals centered on attaining alcohol abstinence. Regarding quantitative findings, Trial 1 showed statistically significant increases in goals generation over the course of treatment, while proportion of achieved goals stayed constant. In Trial 2, number of goals generated remained constant, while proportion of goals achieved increased. Trial 2 findings showed greater goal generation over time was associated with better physical health-related QoL, and drinking-related goals predicted improved alcohol outcomes. Overall, this secondary, dual-trial study suggests patient-driven goal-setting in harm-reduction treatment is feasible: Participants generated diverse, personalized, and clinically relevant goals. This study built on positive efficacy trial findings, indicating participants' generation of goals was associated with improved treatment outcomes. More research is needed to further understand more nuanced relationships between harm-reduction goal-setting and treatment outcomes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).

N2  - Shelter-recruited adolescents are known to have high rates of substance abuse and co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. Many studies have documented these mental health concerns, but only a small number of studies have tested interventions that may be useful for ameliorating these vulnerabilities. The current study compared three empirically supported psychotherapy interventions, Motivational Interviewing (MI), the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA), and Ecologically-Based Family Therapy (EBFT) with 179 substance abusing runaway adolescents (47 % female, 74 % minority) and their primary caretaker recruited through a Midwestern runaway crisis shelter. Examining both child and primary caretaker reports, each treatment was associated with significant reductions in internalizing and externalizing behaviors to 24 months post-baseline. However, the trajectory of change differed among the treatments. Adolescents receiving MI showed a quicker reduction in internalizing and externalizing behaviors but also a quicker increase in these behaviors compared to adolescents receiving EBFT, who continued to evidence improvements to 24 months. The findings provide support for continued evaluation of these treatments for use with this vulnerable population of adolescents.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Universal access to the School Breakfast Program (SBP) is intended to help low-income and food-insecure students overcome barriers to eating breakfast. However, SBP participation is often still low despite universal access. Further information is needed with regard to these children's breakfast behaviors, and in particular breakfast behaviors among youth from food-insecure families, to inform effective breakfast interventions., OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine breakfast behaviors among a large sample of urban students with universal access to the SBP and to identify differences in breakfast behaviors among children from food-secure compared with food-insecure households., METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 821 fourth- through sixth-grade students and their parents from 16 schools was conducted. Students reported the foods/drinks selected and location of obtaining food/drink on the morning of data collection, parents reported household food security status using the 6-item Food Security Survey Module, and the school district provided SBP participation data during the fall semester of 2013. Multivariable linear regression models accounting for school-level clustering were used to examine differences in breakfast behaviors across 3 levels of household food security: food secure, low food secure, and very low food secure., RESULTS: Students participated in the SBP 31.2% of possible days, with 13% never participating in the SBP. One-fifth (19.4%) of students purchased something from a corner store for breakfast, and 16.9% skipped breakfast. Forty-six percent of students were food insecure; few differences in breakfast behaviors were observed across levels of food security., CONCLUSIONS: Despite universal access to the SBP, participation in the SBP is low. Breakfast skipping and selection of foods of low nutritional quality in the morning are common, regardless of household food security status. Additional novel implementation of the SBP and addressing students' breakfast preferences may be necessary to further reduce barriers to students obtaining a free, healthful breakfast. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01924130.

N2  - This study reports secondary outcome findings on depressive symptoms from a randomized clinical trial testing three interventions for substance-abusing runaway adolescents. In particular, the effect of a family systems therapy, Ecologically Based Family Therapy (EBFT), and two individual therapies, the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) and Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), on adolescent and primary caretaker (PC) depressive symptoms were compared. Findings showed that youth's depressive symptoms were significantly reduced in each treatment to 2 years postbaseline. However, the trajectory of change differed across treatments, with adolescents receiving MET showing a more rapid reduction in depressive symptoms but a quicker increase in symptoms compared with adolescents receiving EBFT. PCs receiving EBFT showed a statistically significant decline in depressive symptoms, but this was not observed for the CRA and MET conditions. These findings can be interpreted to favor EBFT, although future research is needed to test training and implementation strategies for family systems therapies in community-based runaway shelters.

N2  - A culturally diverse sample of formerly homeless youth (ages 6-12) and their families (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;223) participated in a cluster randomized controlled trial of the Early Risers conduct problems prevention program in a supportive housing setting. Parents provided 4 annual behaviorally-based ratings of executive functioning (EF) and conduct problems, including at baseline, over 2 years of intervention programming, and at a 1-year follow-up assessment. Using intent-to-treat analyses, a multilevel latent growth model revealed that the intervention group demonstrated reduced growth in conduct problems over the 4 assessment points. In order to examine mediation, a multilevel parallel process latent growth model was used to simultaneously model growth in EF and growth in conduct problems along with intervention status as a covariate. A significant mediational process emerged, with participation in the intervention promoting growth in EF, which predicted negative growth in conduct problems. The model was consistent with changes in EF fully mediating intervention-related changes in youth conduct problems over the course of the study. These findings highlight the critical role that EF plays in behavioral change and lends further support to its importance as a target in preventive interventions with populations at risk for conduct problems.

N2  - While many studies provide useful information on the risk behaviors in which homeless youth engage, few prior studies evaluate Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) risk related reduction strategies. In this study, homeless youth (n = 180) were recruited from a drop-in center and randomly assigned to one of two conditions, either an integrated individual cognitive-behavioral treatment and HIV prevention intervention that focused on skills building and education or to treatment as usual. All youth were assessed at entry into the program and at 3 and 6 month follow-up points. Findings showed an interaction between treatment condition, age and time. In the interaction, youth assigned to the integrated treatment reported greater condom usage than youth assigned to treatment as usual, with younger youth assigned to treatment as usual showing no change in condom use. The number of sexual partners reported by youth in both treatment conditions was also reduced over time. However, youth in both conditions continued to engage in other high-risk behaviors. The integrated treatment findings are promising and suggest that interventions which target both HIV risk behavior in addition to other life areas (substance use, mental health and housing) among homeless youth may be necessary in order to significantly impact high-risk behaviors among this unique group.

N2  - Social quality is the extent to which people are able to participate in social relationships under conditions which enhance their well-being, capacities and potential and enables them to shape their own circumstances and contribute to societal development. We assessed whether women in homeless shelters differed from men on social quality factors that constitute the quality of their daily life and whether factor scores changed at a different rate for women and men after shelter exit. Data were collected as part of a randomised controlled trial. In 18 shelters across the Netherlands, 183 participants were recruited between December 2010 and December 2012 and followed for 9 months. Adults were eligible if they were about to move from shelter to (supported) independent housing and their shelter stay had been shorter than 14 months. At baseline, women were significantly younger than men. They were more likely to have children, to have minor children staying with them, to be lower educated, to be unemployed and to have been victimised than men. Women had used more services and reported lower self-esteem, less satisfaction with health and empowerment and higher psychological distress. They were less likely than men to have used alcohol excessively or cannabis. We found no significant differences between women and men in changes over time on the social quality factors. As women were disadvantaged at baseline compared to men regarding many factors, we concluded that women in homeless shelters are a particularly vulnerable group. Moreover, an opportunity remains for shelter services to improve women's social quality during and after their shelter stay.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Adequate nutrition is essential during the lactation period for better maternal and child health outcomes. Although food insecurity and dietary monotony (defined as less diverse diet), two important determinants of undernutrition, are endemic in the rural mountains of Nepal, insufficiently examined and assessed for risk factors in mothers during lactation, a life stage of high nutritional demand. This study aimed to assess the status and factors associated with food insecurity and dietary diversity among lactating mothers residing in the mountains of Nepal., METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in an urban municipality in the mountainous Bajhang District of far-western Nepal. The sampling frame and strategy led to 417 randomly selected lactating mothers. Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) and the tool "Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women" developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization were used to measure food insecurity and dietary diversity, respectively. Additional information on socio-demographics and risk factors were collected. Multivariable logistics regression assessed correlates of study outcomes., RESULTS: Overall, 54% of the households were food insecure, and over half (53%) of the mothers had low dietary diversity. Food insecurity status (mild food insecurity AOR = 10.12, 95% CI = 4.21-24.34; moderate food insecurity AOR = 8.17, 95% CI = 3.24-20.59, and severe food insecurity AOR = 10.56, 95% CI = 3.92-28.43) were associated with higher odds of dietary monotony. Likewise, participants with lower dietary diversity were 8.5 times more likely to be food insecure than those with higher dietary diversity (AOR = 8.48, 95% CI = 3.76-19.14). The monthly income of the family was positively associated with food insecurity. Participants' (AOR = 3.92 95%CI = 1.76-8.71) or spouses' (AOR = 2.90, 95% CI = 1.07-7.85) unemployment was associated with higher odds of being food insecure. Likewise, owning a cultivable land (AOR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.28-0.84) and participant's unemployment status (AOR = 5.92, 95% CI = 3.02-11.63), were significantly associated with increased odds of dietary monotony., CONCLUSION: The observed food insecurity and poor dietary diversity among lactating mothers, the correlates associated with these outcomes, may help local stakeholders to identify local health needs and subgroups for targeted interventions. Socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers should be specifically targeted for relevant programs and policies.

N2  - Globally, study of factors contributing to the street-migration of the tens of millions of street-involved children focus almost exclusively on children's perspectives. In this study, we assess household and maternal factors associated with street-migration of children through self-report of 1974 randomly selected women in semi-rural Kenya. Contributing new perspectives on this global phenomenon, data show a statistically significant association between increased maternal childhood adversities and street-migration of children (p < 0.001). Higher household wealth (p < 0.01) and maternal education (p < 0.05) were associated with lower odds of street-migration of children. Social support, reporting HIV+, school enrollment of biologically-related children, overall health, reported alcohol use, and functional literacy significantly mediated these pathways. Protecting children from street-migration in the next generation requires reducing childhood adversities in the present generation.

N2  - Importance: There have been no published randomized clinical trials with a primary outcome of socioeconomic inclusion for young people who have experienced homelessness. Objective: To explore whether young people exiting homelessness who received rent subsidies and adult mentorship experienced more socioeconomic inclusion relative to young people who received only rent subsidies. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a convergent mixed-methods, unblinded, 2-group, parallel randomized clinical trial with 1:1 allocation embedded within a community-based framework in 3 cities in Ontario, Canada. Participants were enrolled between March 1 and September 30, 2019, and were followed up through March 31, 2022. Interventions: Participants (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;24) were randomly assigned adult mentors (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;13) who had been recruited and screened by community partner agencies. All participants received portable rent subsidies (subsidy not tied to a specific location) for 2 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary quantitative outcomes were self-reported measures of community integration (psychological and physical) and self-esteem-proxy indicators of socioeconomic inclusion. Community integration was measured with the Community Integration Scale, with a score range of 1 to 7 for the physical component and 4 to 20 for the psychological component; higher scores indicate higher integration. Self-esteem was measured with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, with a score range of 0 to 30; higher scores indicate greater self-esteem. Secondary quantitative outcomes included social connectedness, hopelessness, and academic and vocational participation. All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. Results: A total of 24 youths (12 women [50.0%]; mean [SD] age, 21.8 [2.2] years [range, 18-26 years]; race and ethnicity: 10 White [41.7%], 8 Black [33.3%], 2 Asian [8.3%], 2 Indigenous [8.3%], and 2 different choice [8.3%]) transitioned out of homelessness and into market-rent housing. All youths in the group that received mentorship and in the group that did not receive mentorship had stable or nonsignificant improvements in all study outcomes at the primary end point of 18 months compared with baseline (mean [SD] Community Integration Scale psychological score: mentorship group, 11.3 [2.6] at baseline and 11.2 [3.9] at 18 months; no-mentorship group, 10.8 [4.1] at baseline and 13.2 [2.9] at 18 months; mean [SD] Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score: mentorship group, 16.0 [4.6] at baseline and 18.1 [5.2] at 18 months; no-mentorship group, 16.3 [6.1] at baseline and 19.6 [5.7] at 18 months). However, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the Community Integration Scale psychological score (adjusted mean difference, -2.0; 95% CI, -5.0 to 1.0; P&thinsp;=&thinsp;.18) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score (adjusted mean difference, -1.4; 95% CI, -5.0 to 2.3; P&thinsp;=&thinsp;.44) 18 months after randomization. Ancillary analysis suggested that youths with informal mentors (mentors outside the study) at baseline felt more psychologically integrated at 18 months relative to those with no informal mentors at baseline (adjusted mean difference, 3.6; 95% CI, 0.4-6.8; P&thinsp;=&thinsp;.03). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions made it challenging for mentors and mentees to connect, which may have affected the findings. Steady socioeconomic outcomes-potentially attributable to portable rent subsidies-are noteworthy, given the socioeconomic inequities this population has faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The possible benefit of informal mentorship warrants further investigation. This small pilot study was designed with the intention of generating data and hypotheses for a full-scale study; findings should be interpreted with caution.

N2  - This cross-sectional study assessed predictors of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) positivity with baseline data collected on recently released male parolees (N = 157) participating in a randomized trial focused on reduction of drug use, recidivism, and risk for hepatitis and HIV infections. In this sample, the prevalence of HCV was 25%. The logistic regression analysis revealed that being an injection drug user was significantly related to HCV infection. However, contrary to most of the current literature, being Black had significantly lower odds of contracting HCV than their White counterparts. Moreover, having lived on the streets, not being part of a close family in childhood, and being older were also associated with HCV infection. These findings highlight the need for skilled assessments that target the vulnerabilities of homeless adults, especially those who have been incarcerated. Understanding drug use patterns, childhood networks, and family relationships, may assist in the design of interventions to reduce risky drug use and address behaviors derived from disadvantaged childhood.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It is well documented that a disproportionate number of homeless adults have childhood histories of foster care placement(s). This study examines the relationship between foster care placement as a predictor of adult substance use disorders (including frequency, severity and type), mental illness, vocational functioning, service use and duration of homelessness among a sample of homeless adults with mental illness. We hypothesize that a history of foster care predicts earlier, more severe and more frequent substance use, multiple mental disorder diagnoses, discontinuous work history, and longer durations of homelessness., METHODS: This study was conducted using baseline data from two randomized controlled trials in Vancouver, British Columbia for participants who responded to a series of questions pertaining to out-of-home care at 12 months follow-up (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;442). Primary outcomes included current mental disorders; substance use including type, frequency and severity; physical health; duration of homelessness; vocational functioning; and service use., RESULTS: In multivariable regression models, a history of foster care placement independently predicted incomplete high school, duration of homelessness, discontinuous work history, less severe types of mental illness, multiple mental disorders, early initiation of drug and/or alcohol use, and daily drug use., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first Canadian study to investigate the relationship between a history of foster care and current substance use among homeless adults with mental illness, controlling for several other potential confounding factors. It is important to screen homeless youth who exit foster care for substance use, and to provide integrated treatment for concurrent disorders to homeless youth and adults who have both psychiatric and substance use problems., TRIALS REGISTRATION NUMBERS: Both trials are registered with the International Standard Randomized Control Trial Number Register and were assigned ISRCTN57595077 (Vancouver At Home Study: Housing First plus assertive community treatment versus congregate housing plus supports versus treatment as usual) and ISRCTN66721740 (Vancouver At Home Study: Housing First plus intensive case management versus treatment as usual) on September 9, 2012.

N2  - An intensive case management intervention for homeless persons was evaluated by random assignment of 202 cases (involving 213 adults and 70 children) to the intervention or a control group. Full follow-up data (4 interviews: at baseline and at 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-ups) were available on 98 cases (105 adults and 37 children). The follow-up rates for the 2 groups were not significantly different. Based on 13 repeated measures analyses, there were 3 statistically significant linear time effects (indicating overall change across the follow-up period) and 3 linear Time x Condition interactions (indicating differential change over time for intervention vs. control participants). Regardless of condition, adult participants improved in terms of their experience of homelessness, as well as on physical health symptoms and stressful life events. Condition x Time interactions indicating positive intervention impact were observed on the quality of housing environments, stressful life events, and interviewer ratings of psychopathology.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Adolescence is characterized by rapid growth and development with a significantly increased need for macro and micronutrients. However, there is little empirical evidence on the burden of anaemia among adolescent girls in developing countries such as Ethiopia. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating the magnitude of anaemia with an aim to guide design of intervention modalities to address anaemia among adolescent girls. METHODS: The study employed a community based cross sectional design. The study was conducted on weekends to capture both in school and out of school adolescent girls. Data was collected from a total 1323 adolescent girls. From each district, we randomly selected villages and ensured that the sampled households had a range geographical spread (lowlands, highlands) within the larger category of rural and urban. We performed anaemia testing using HemoCue B-Haemoglobin analyser. We applied a complex survey data analysis method to estimate the level of anaemia. The hemoglobin level was adjusted for altitude and smoking status. We ran a logistic regression model to evaluate predictors of anaemia. RESULTS: The overall anaemia prevalence ranged from 24 to 38%, with an average rate of 29%. Less than half of the girls heard the term anaemia, and about one third knew the relationship between anaemia and the intake of iron rich foods. The risk of anaemia is higher among adolescent girls in their early adolescence period (10-14&thinsp;years) (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR); 1.98; 95% CI; 1.03, 3.82] and among adolescent girls who lived in moderately food insecure households (AOR 1.48; 95% CI; 1.05-2.09). However, knowing the term "anaemia" was found to be protective against the risk of anaemia. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of anaemia was particularly high among adolescent girls in their early age and among those living in food insecure households.

N2  - Homeless alcohol-dependent individuals were randomly assigned to receive either a behavioral intervention (i.e., the Community Reinforcement Approach [CRA]) or the standard treatment (STD) at a large day shelter. Ninety-one men and 15 women participated. The majority of participants were White (64%), but both Hispanic (19%) and Native American (13%) individuals were represented as well. Overall, the decline in drinking levels from intake through follow-ups was significant. As predicted, CRA participants significantly outperformed STD group members on drinking measures across the 5 follow-ups, which ranged from 2 months to 1 year after intake. Both conditions showed marked improvement in employment and housing stability.

N2  - This paper evaluates and contrasts the effectiveness of two culturally sensitive AIDS education programs developed by the UCLA AIDS Nursing Network and delivered to 213 impoverished Latina homeless or drug-addicted women in Los Angeles. The Comprehensive Health Seeking and Coping Paradigm guided the program, which was implemented by specially trained Latina nurses and outreach workers. A quasi-experimental design was employed where women were randomized by site into Specialized (N = 82) and Traditional (N = 131) programs. Repeated measures ANOVAS and log-linear models were used to evaluate improvement over a two-week period for women in both groups and to identify interactions with program type. Two-week posttest analyses were also conducted to assess program effectiveness, controlling for baseline values of the measure in question, nonequivalency between groups at baseline, and selected demographic characteristics, including acculturation. Results indicated that women in both AIDS education programs improved significantly in cognitive, behavioral, and psychologic outcomes.

N2  - The short-term results of a randomized trial testing a brief feedback and motivational intervention for substance use among homeless adolescents are presented. Homeless adolescents ages 14-19 (N = 285) recruited from drop-in centers at agencies and from street intercept were randomly assigned to either a brief motivational enhancement (ME) group or 1 of 2 control groups. The 1-session motivational intervention presented personal feedback about patterns of risks related to alcohol or substance use in a style consistent with motivational interviewing. Follow-up interviews were conducted at 1 and 3 months postintervention. Youths who received the motivational intervention reported reduced illicit drug use other than marijuana at 1-month follow-up compared with youths in the control groups. Treatment effects were not found with respect to alcohol or marijuana. Post hoc analyses within the ME group suggested that those who were rated as more engaged and more likely to benefit showed greater drug use reduction than did those rated as less engaged. Limitations of the study are discussed as are implications for development of future substance use interventions for this high-risk group.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is much more prevalent among young people experiencing homelessness than in the general population of adolescents and young adults. Although many young homeless smokers are motivated to quit, there are no empirically-evaluated smoking cessation programs for this population. It is important that any such program address the factors known to be associated with quitting-related outcomes among homeless young people, to provide ongoing support in a way that accommodates the mobility of this population, and does not rely on scarce service provider resources for its delivery. The objective of this project is to develop and pilot test a text messaging-based intervention (TMI), as an adjunct to brief cessation counseling and provision of nicotine patches, to help homeless young people who want to quit smoking. METHODS/DESIGN: This pilot study will utilize a cluster cross-over randomized controlled design with up to 80 current smokers who desire to quit and are recruited from three drop-in centers serving young people experiencing homelessness in the Los Angeles area. All participants will be provided with a minimum standard of care: a 30-min group-based smoking cessation counseling session and free nicotine replacement. Half of these smokers will then also receive the TMI, as an adjunct to this standard care, which will provide 6 weeks of ongoing support for quitting. This support includes continued and more intensive education regarding nicotine dependence, quitting smoking, and relapse; does not require additional agency resources; can be available "on demand" to users; and includes features to personalize the quitting experience. This study will investigate whether receiving the TMI adjunct to standard smoking cessation care results in greater reductions in cigarette smoking compared to standard care alone over a 3-month period. DISCUSSION: This study has the potential to address an important gap in the clinical research literature on cigarette smoking cessation and provide empirical support for using a TMI to provide ongoing assistance and support for quitting among young smokers experiencing homelessness.

N2  - Objective: This paper compares the accuracy of predicting suicide from Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) or history of illness. Population Studied: 5 313 965 Veterans who at least had two primary care visits between 2008 and 2016. Study Design: The dependent variable was suicide or intentional self-injury. The independent variables were 10 495 International Classification of Disease (ICD) Version 9 codes, age, and gender. The ICD codes included 40 V-codes used for measuring SDoH, such as family disruption, family history of substance abuse, lack of education, legal impediments, social isolation, unemployment, and homelessness. The sample was randomly divided into training (90 percent) and validation (10 percent) sets. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AROC) was used to measure accuracy of predictions in the validation set. Principal Findings: Separate analyses were done for inpatient and outpatient codes; the results were similar. In the hospitalized group, the mean age was 67.2 years, and 92.1 percent were male. The mean number of medical diagnostic codes during the study period was 37; and 12.9 percent had at least one SDoH V-code. At least one episode of suicide or intentional self-injury occurred in 1.89 percent of cases. SDoH V-codes, on average, elevated the risk of suicide or intentional self-injury by 24-fold (ranging from 4- to 86-fold). An index of 40 SDoH codes predicted suicide or intentional self-injury with an AROC of 0.64. An index of 10 445 medical diagnoses, without SDoH V-codes, had AROC of 0.77. The combined SDoH and medical diagnoses codes also had AROC of 0.77. Conclusion: In predicting suicide or intentional self-harm, SDoH V-codes add negligible information beyond what is already available in medical diagnosis codes. Implications for Practice: Policies that affect SDoH (eg, housing policies, resilience training) may not have an impact on suicide rates, if they do not change the underlying medical causes of SDoH.

N2  - Cognitive impairments are common in homeless youth and negatively impact academic and vocational outcomes. We examined the feasibility and efficacy of cognitive interventions provided to 18- to 22-year-old homeless youth living in urban supportive housing. Ninety-one homeless youth were randomized to receive either targeted cognitive training (cognitive remediation) or general cognitive activation (computer skills training). Cognitive and psychological outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 13 and 26 sessions, and 1 month postintervention. A high dropout rate highlighted the feasibility challenges of treating this population. Intent-to-treat analysis found significant improvements across groups in specific and global measures of cognition and psychological distress, with no significant group differences. Transition-age homeless youth show improvements in cognitive and psychological functioning when engaged in interventions that address their cognitive development. This speaks to the malleability of cognitive skills in this cohort and lays the groundwork for future research to address their cognitive health.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Youth experiencing homelessness are at high risk for suicide, yet few studies have evaluated risk reduction interventions targeting suicidal ideation in this vulnerable population. A comprehensive approach to risk-reduction is needed that addresses basic needs and provides targeted interventions for those at highest risk. The protocol described builds on the design of the first randomized trial of Housing First (HF) for homeless youth. The primary objective is to determine whether housing combined with supportive services that include suicide screening and targeted psychotherapy (Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention) is effective for reducing suicidal ideation and other secondary outcomes (depression and suicide attempts). Additionally, we will explore mediators of the treatment effect (housing stability and substance use) and determinants of implementation. METHODS: Youth recruited to the HF trial will be randomized to HF&thinsp;+&thinsp;supportive services (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;120), or supportive services alone (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;120). The "Suicide Treatment Education and Prevention" (STEP) protocol will additionally screen youth in both arms at baseline and 3&thinsp;months for suicidal ideation (SSI-W). Those who screen as moderate risk for suicide (SSI-W&thinsp;&ge;&thinsp;10) will be offered CTSP, which includes up to 9 sessions over the first 6&thinsp;months following enrollment. CTSP will be delivered in one-on-one sessions by a trained advocate. Research assessments will be collected to assess outcomes (including suicidal ideation) at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12&thinsp;months. Qualitative interviews with subjects receiving CTSP and other stakeholders will explore implementation determinants. DISCUSSION: The study will fill an important gap in the literature about the added benefit of HF combined with supportive services including suicide screening and treatment for reducing suicidal ideation in homeless youth. With the urgent need to address both homelessness and suicide risk, evidence is needed about services that can be integrated into delivery settings for youth experiencing homelessness.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Homeless female ex-offenders (homeless female offenders) exiting jail and prison are at a critical juncture during reentry and transitioning into the community setting., OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to compare the effect of a dialectical behavioral therapy-case management (DBT-CM) program with a health promotion (HP) program on achieving drug and alcohol abstinence among female parolees/probationers residing in the community., METHODS: We conducted a multicenter parallel randomized controlled trial with 130 female parolees/probationers (aged 19-64 years) residing in the community randomly assigned to either DBT-CM (n = 65) or HP (n = 65). The trial was conducted in four community-based partner sites in Los Angeles and Pomona, California, from February 2015 to November 2016. Treatment assignment was carried out using a computer-based urn randomization program. The primary outcome was drug and alcohol use abstinence at 6-month follow up., RESULTS: Analysis was based on data from 116 participants with complete outcome data. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that the DBT-CM program remained an independent positive predictor of decrease in drug use among the DBT-CM participants at 6 months (p = .01) as compared with the HP program participants. Being non-White (p < .05) and having higher depressive symptom scores (p < .05) were associated with lower odds of drug use abstinence (i.e., increased the odds of drug use) at 6 months., DISCUSSION: DBT-CM increased drug and alcohol abstinence at 6-month follow-up, compared to an HP program.

N2  - This study examined the effects of integrating mental health, substance abuse, and housing interventions for homeless persons with co-occurring severe mental illness and substance use disorder. With the use of a quasi-experimental design, integrated treatment was compared with standard treatment for 217 homeless, dually diagnosed adults over an 18-month period. The integrated treatment group had fewer institutional days and more days in stable housing, made more progress toward recovery from substance abuse, and showed greater improvement of alcohol use disorders than the standard treatment group. Abuse of drugs other than alcohol (primarily cocaine) improved similarly for both groups. Secondary outcomes, such as psychiatric symptoms, functional status, and quality of life, also improved for both groups, with minimal group differences favoring integrated treatment.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Cigarette smoking and associated high-risk behaviors are prevalent among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH), making appropriately tailored interventions targeting smoking behavior important for this group. We pilot tested a brief text-messaging intervention (TMI) as an adjunct to standard care for YEH who smoke and found promising preliminary effects of the intervention on smoking cessation. The purpose of the present study was to test the TMI's effect on the secondary outcomes of other substance use (including use of other tobacco/nicotine devices) and mental health symptoms. METHODS: A total of 77 participants completed the pilot randomized controlled trial, with 40 receiving the TMI (174 automated text messages plus a group smoking counseling session and provision of nicotine patches). They completed an assessment at baseline and another three months later that evaluated use of other tobacco/nicotine devices, alcohol, marijuana, and anxiety and depression symptoms. RESULTS: We found that the TMI helped to reduce secondary substance use behaviors and mental health symptoms among the participants; mainly there were medium effects of the intervention on changes in other tobacco/nicotine use, drinking, and anxiety and depression symptoms. The intervention did not have an effect on number of marijuana use days in the past month; however, past 30-day marijuana users who received the intervention benefited by reducing the number of times they used marijuana per day. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to helping reduce cigarette smoking, we found that a TMI for YEH was helpful in improving secondary outcomes, suggesting the promise of the TMI on benefiting YEH even beyond targeted smoking behavior. IMPLICATIONS: This pilot study demonstrates that by targeting cigarette smoking using a text message-based intervention among youth experiencing homelessness, effects may be seen in other areas of functioning such as other substance use and mental health.

N2  - Project H&ART was a randomized intervention trial for homeless alcohol abusers in Albuquerque, N.M. Interventions were four months in duration and included: a high intensity program (case management plus peer-supervised housing), a medium intensity group (peer-supervised housing only); a housed, and a nonhoused control group. Clients were interviewed at baseline and re-interviewed ten months following program entry to determine substance use, housing stability and employment status. Program graduation rates were about 25% for the three housed groups. The outcome evaluation revealed significant within groups improvements in all of the outcomes, no between groups or racial outcome differences, and more favorable alcohol use and housing stability outcomes among program graduates than dropouts. On follow-up, women in the study had fewer days of alcohol use and had more days of stable housing, but were less likely to be employed, compared with men. We suggest that clients' personal motivation for recovery, rather than program-related factors, were most influential in determining outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: HIV disproportionately impacts young, black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) who experience disparities across the HIV care continuum. A more nuanced understanding of facilitators and barriers to engagement in care, missed visits, antiretroviral uptake, adherence and viral suppression could improve care and intervention design., METHODS: A randomized controlled trial of an online intervention, healthMpowerment, enrolled 465 YBMSM (18-30 years); 193 identified as HIV-positive. Bivariable and multivariable analyses of baseline data explored predictors of: engagement in care, missed visits, antiretroviral uptake, self-reported adherence, and viral suppression., RESULTS: Mean age was 24.9 years; most identified as gay (71.0%) and were receiving HIV care (89.1%). Among those in care, 52.1% reported no missed visits in the past 12 months, 41 (24.6%) reported one missed visit, and 39 (23.4%) reported two or more. Having insurance (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 4.5; 95% CI: 1.3, 15.8) and provider self-efficacy (POR 20.1; 95% CI: 6.1, 64.1) were associated with being in care. Those with a college degree (POR 9.1; 95% CI: 1.9, 45.2) and no recent marijuana (POR 2.6; 95% CI: 1.2, 5.6) or methamphetamine use (POR 5.4; 95% CI: 1.0, 28.5) were less likely to miss visits. Most (n = 153, 84.1%) had been prescribed antiretroviral therapy. A majority of participants (70.8%) reported &ge;90% adherence; those with depressive symptoms had 4.7 times the odds of reporting adherence <90% (95% CI: 1.65, 13.37). Of participants who reported viral load testing in the past six months, 65% (n = 102) reported an undetectable viral load. Disclosure to sex partners was associated with viral suppression (POR 6.0; 95% CI: 1.6, 22.4)., CONCLUSIONS: Multi-level facilitators and barriers to engagement across the continuum of care were identified in this sample of YBMSM. Understanding the distinct needs of YBMSM at each stage of the continuum and addressing them through tailored approaches is critical for long term success in care.

N2  - BACKGROUND: One of the main priorities of Dutch organisations providing shelter services is to develop evidence-based interventions in the care for abused women and homeless people. To date, most of these organisations have not used specific intervention models and the interventions which have been implemented rarely have an empirical and theoretical foundation. The present studies aim to examine the effectiveness of critical time intervention (CTI) for abused women and homeless people., METHODS: In two multi-centre randomised controlled trials we investigate whether CTI, a time-limited (nine month) outreach intervention, is more effective than care-as-usual for abused women and homeless people making the transition from shelter facilities to supported or independent housing. Participants were recruited in 19 women's shelter facilities and 22 homeless shelter facilities across The Netherlands and randomly allocated to the intervention group (CTI) or the control group (care-as-usual). They were interviewed four times in nine months: once before leaving the shelter, and then at three, six and nine months after leaving the shelter. Quality of life (primary outcome for abused women) and recurrent loss of housing (primary outcome for homeless people) as well as secondary outcomes (e.g. care needs, self-esteem, loneliness, social support, substance use, psychological distress and service use) were assessed during the interviews. In addition, the model integrity of CTI was investigated during the data collection period., DISCUSSION: Based on international research CTI is expected to be an appropriate intervention for clients making the transition from institutional to community living. If CTI proves to be effective for abused women and homeless people, shelter services could include this case management model in their professional standards and improve the (quality of) services for clients., TRIAL REGISTRATION: NTR3463 and NTR3425.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a brief intervention to promote responsible substance use and safe sex behaviors in youths experiencing homelessness (YEH). Methods: DESIGN: A Solomon four-group (double randomized controlled trial) longitudinal design with repeated measures (3- and 6-month follow-ups) was used in drop-in centers for YEH in Austin, Texas and Columbus, Ohio from which 602 youths, 18-24 years-old (M = 21 &plusmn; 1.8), 50% white; 69.9% heterosexual were recruited. A manualized one-on-one intervention consisted of six modules delivered via laptop computers. Modules focused on communication, goal-setting, substance use refusal, safe sex behaviors, enhanced psychological capital (hope, optimism, resilience, self-efficacy, gratitude), and life satisfaction. Valid and reliable measures of hope, optimism, future time perspective, resilience, social connectedness, gratitude, condom intention, self-efficacy for safe sex, safe sex behaviors, self-efficacy for substance use refusal, and life satisfaction were used to collect data for which three hypotheses were tested, using intent to treat, with multi-level modeling (R). Results: The analysis showed partial support for all hypotheses: (1) post-test outcomes were greater than pretests; (2) intervention group outcomes were greater than control group measures; and (3) significant effects for pretesting. YEH in Ohio completed significantly more sessions than YEH in Texas (p = .001), but took significantly longer to complete all six sessions (p = .001). Discussion: This brief intervention had significant effects on YEH to promote healthy attitudes and behaviors that merit further testing in larger samples.

N2  - The aim of this study is to investigate adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) who are homeless or unstably housed. We evaluated homeless or unstably housed PLWHA (n=644) in three US cities were enrolled in the Housing and Health Study. Using baseline data and controlling for gender, race, age, and education, we examined associations between self-reported two- and Seven-day adherence and access to healthcare, mental health, substance use, and attitudes toward HIV medical therapy. Of the 644 participants, 358 (55%) were currently on HAART. For two-day adherence, 280 (78%) reported missing no prescribed doses (100% adherence), and for seven-day adherence, 291 (81%) reported > or =90% adherence. Logistic regression analyses indicated being younger, not having health insurance, and drug use were associated with missing > or =1 dose over the past two days. Scoring lower on SF-36 mental component summary scale and having greater risk of depression (CES-D) and stress (Perceived Stress Scale) were associated with poorer adherence for both two- and seven-day outcomes. Negative attitudes toward HIV treatment were also associated with lower adherence. Adherence to HIV medications in this population is similar to other groups. Coexisting problems of access to healthcare, higher risk of mental health problems, along with poorer attitudes toward treatment are associated with increased likelihood of missing doses. Comprehensive models of HIV care that include a continuum of medical and social services are essential for treating this population.

N2  - Background Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality among people experiencing homelessness. This study investigated whether housing intervention affects cardiovascular disease risk factors among homeless adults with mental illnesses over a 24-month period. Methods and Results We conducted a randomized controlled trial of a Housing First intervention that provided community-based scattered-site housing and support services. Five hundred seventy-five participants were randomized to the intervention (n=301) or treatment as usual (TAU) (n=274). Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle using generalized estimating equations. There were no differences in change over 24 months between the 2 groups for blood pressure, tobacco, and cocaine/crack use. However, the intervention had an impact on reducing the number of days of alcohol intoxication by 1.58 days compared with TAU (95% CI, -2.88 to -0.27, P=0.0018). Over the 24-month period, both the intervention and TAU groups had significant reductions in tobacco and cocaine use. Conclusions The intervention, compared with TAU, did not result in greater improvements in many of the selected cardiovascular risk factors. Since the study took place in a service-rich city with a range of pre-existing supportive services and universal health insurance, the high level of usual services available to the TAU group may have contributed to reductions in their cardiovascular disease risk factors. Further research is needed to develop interventions to reduce risk factors of cardiovascular disease among people experiencing homelessness and mental illness beyond existing treatments.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess HIV-related drug and sex risk behaviors and evaluate factors associated with change in risk behaviors among runaway and homeless adolescents, 244 street youth were recruited from a community drop-in center serving high-risk youth., METHOD: Using a cross-sectional design, approximately half of study participants received training in a peer-based intervention that included principles derived from the health belief model, while the remaining subjects received no intervention. Subjects were interviewed at baseline, immediately following the intervention (for those receiving the training) and 3 months later. Logistic regression and analysis of covariance were used to analyze intervention effects., RESULTS: Compared to youth in the control condition, runaways receiving the intervention significantly increased their knowledge about HIV. Contrary to the health belief model, in multivariate analyses knowledge and greater perceived chance for HIV were associated with high risk behavior. On the other hand, lower concern about HIV infection was also associated with high risk behavior, supporting the health belief model., CONCLUSIONS: Despite the intervention's success in increasing knowledge of HIV and AIDS, the association between knowledge, perceived likelihood of infection and high risk behaviors suggest that, without other alternatives, runaways will maintain their risks. The association noted between lower concern and high risk behaviors underscores the challenge faced in developing effective interventions with this population.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: In a cluster randomized controlled trial, this study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of and fidelity to Houvast (Dutch for "grip"), a strengths-based intervention to improve the quality of life for homeless young adults., METHODS: Fidelity was measured six months after professionals and team leaders at five Dutch shelters for homeless young adults finished their training in Houvast. Fidelity was measured with the Dutch version of the strengths model fidelity scale, which consists of ten indicators distributed across three subscales: structure, supervision, and clinical practice. A total fidelity score was composed by averaging the ten indicator scores for each facility. During one-day audits by two trained assessors visiting each facility, a file analysis (N=46), a focus group with homeless young adults (N=19), and interviews with the team leader and supervisor (N=9) were conducted. Professionals, supervisors, and team leaders completed questionnaires two weeks before the audit (N=43). In addition, an evaluation of the audit was conducted six months later., RESULTS: Although none of the five shelters achieved a sufficient total model fidelity score, median scores on caseload, group supervision, and strengths assessment were satisfactory. Each facility received a report with a set of recommendations to improve model fidelity. The evaluation showed improvements in use of the strengths assessment and personal recovery plans and in supervision., CONCLUSIONS: Facilities face several challenges when implementing a new intervention, and implementing Houvast was no exception. Learning experiences and possible explanations for the insufficient total fidelity scores are reported.

N2  - Objective To assess the prevalence of and factors associated with depression among adolescent boys and girls. Design We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study. Setting This study was carried out in 82 randomly selected clusters (57 rural, 15 non-slum urban and 10 slums) from eight divisions of Bangladesh. Participants We interviewed 4907 adolescent boys and 4949 adolescent girls. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome measure was 'any depression' and the secondary outcome measures were types of depression: no or minimal, mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe. Results The overall prevalence of no or minimal, mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression was 75.5%, 17.9%, 5,4%, 1.1% and 0.1%, respectively. Across most of the sociodemographic, lifestyle and anthropometric strata, the prevalence of any depression was higher among adolescent girls. In both sexes, depression was associated with higher age, higher maternal education, paternal occupation e.g., business, absence of a 6-9-year-old member in the household, food insecurity, household consumption of unfortified oil, household use of non-iodised salt, insufficient physical activity (adjusted odds ratio, AOR: 1.24 for boys, 1.44 for girls) and increased television viewing time e.g., &ge;121 minute/day (AOR: 1.95 for boys, 1.99 for girls). Only among boys, depression was also associated with higher paternal education e.g., complete secondary and above (AOR: 1.42), absence of another adolescent member in the household (AOR: 1.34), household use of solid biomass fuel (AOR: 1.39), use of any tobacco products (AOR: 2.17), and consumption of processed food (AOR: 1.24). Only among girls, non-slum urban residence, Muslim religion, and household size &les;4 were also associated with depression. Conclusion The prevalence of depression among adolescent boys and girls is high in Bangladesh. In most sociodemographic, lifestyle and anthropometric strata, the prevalence is higher among girls. In this age group, depression is associated with a number of sociodemographic and lyfestyle factors. The government of Bangladesh should consider these findings while integrating adolescent mental health in the existing and future programmes.

N2  - This study evaluated the effectiveness of the three approaches for treating dual disorder clients who were homeless at intake: integrated assertive community treatment (IACT), assertive community treatment only (ACTO), and standard care (SC). Multilevel Random Coefficient Modeling (MRCM) was used to analyze longitudinal effects and to identify mediators of significant treatment effects. The outcome variables were consumer satisfaction, stable housing, psychiatric symptoms, and substance abuse. The eight mediators were service utilization variables: program contacts, phone contacts, substance abuse contacts, assistance with activities of daily living, transportation assistance, help finding permanent housing, help with emotional problems, and medication assistance. The 191 eligible participants were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions and followed for a period of 30 months. Both ACTO and IACT produced better outcomes than SC on consumer satisfaction and stable housing. There were no differences on any of the outcome variables between ACTO versus IACT when comparing main effects. However, there were several treatment by time interactions. In addition, there were many mediation effects.

N2  - My Baby's First Teacher is an intervention designed specifically for parents with infants staying in emergency homeless shelters. Infants are overrepresented in shelter populations and face considerable risk to their development, including mental health. We utilized a randomized controlled design across three family shelters to evaluate the program's effectiveness with 24 dyads assigned to the intervention compared to 21 dyads in care-as-usual. Dyads were randomized by round at each site to account for shelter effects. We used path analysis to illustrate change over time and in relation to intervention assignment.

N2  - Virtual Reality (VR) has been increasingly referred to as the "ultimate empathy machine" since it allows users to experience any situation from any point of view. However, empirical evidence supporting the claim that VR is a more effective method of eliciting empathy than traditional perspective-taking is limited. Two experiments were conducted in order to compare the short and long-term effects of a traditional perspective-taking task and a VR perspective-taking task (Study 1), and to explore the role of technological immersion when it comes to different types of mediated perspective-taking tasks (Study 2). Results of Study 1 show that over the course of eight weeks participants in both conditions reported feeling empathetic and connected to the homeless at similar rates, however, participants who became homeless in VR had more positive, longer-lasting attitudes toward the homeless and signed a petition supporting the homeless at a significantly higher rate than participants who performed a traditional perspective-taking task. Study 2 compared three different types of perspective-taking tasks with different levels of immersion (traditional vs. desktop computer vs. VR) and a control condition (where participants received fact-driven information about the homeless). Results show that participants who performed any type of perspective-taking task reported feeling more empathetic and connected to the homeless than the participants who only received information. Replicating the results from Study 1, there was no difference in self-report measures for any of the perspective-taking conditions, however, a significantly higher number of participants in the VR condition signed a petition supporting affordable housing for the homeless compared to the traditional and less immersive conditions. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

N2  - Illicit drug use and cognitive distortions confer significant risks to youth suicidal thoughts and behaviors. However, there has been limited evidence regarding the efficacy of suicide prevention interventions with homeless youth, especially studies testing whether such interventions can reduce the risk for suicidal ideation associated with illicit drug use. Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) between the ages of 18 to 24 years were recruited from a drop-in center. Youth were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Youth reported their illicit drug use, cognitive distortions, and suicidal ideation 4 times over 9 months. A multiple-group multilevel structural equation model showed that higher illicit drug use at baseline predicted a slower reduction in cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation in the TAU group. These associations were not found in the CTSP + TAU group, suggesting an interruption of such risk from illicit drug use. Findings suggest that CTSP can reduce the risk of illicit drug use as a treatment barrier towards cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation among homeless youth, with implications to improve treatment efforts and to reduce premature mortality in a vulnerable population.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Young, black men who have sex with men are disproportionately impacted by the US HIV epidemic, and HIV-positive, young, black men who have sex with men face stark disparities in HIV clinical outcomes., METHODS: We performed an observational analysis of the 199 HIV-positive black men aged 18 to 30 years followed up for 12 months in healthMpowerment, a randomized controlled trial of an Internet-based HIV prevention intervention, to identify time-varying correlates of self-reported viral suppression using relative risk (RR) regression., RESULTS: Retention at the 12-month visit was 84%. One hundred five (65%) of 162 participants reported being undetectable at baseline. At 3, 6, and 12 months, 83 (72%) of 115, 84 (82%) of 103, and 101 (86%) of 117 reported an undetectable viral load, respectively. In a multivariable model, participants who reported homelessness (RR, 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-0.99), who had clinically significant depressive symptoms (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79-0.98), and who used methamphetamine or crack (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38-0.96) were less likely to report an undetectable viral load. Young men who engaged in condomless insertive anal intercourse were more likely to report viral suppression (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04-1.24)., CONCLUSION: HIV care for young, black men who have sex with men must be multidimensional to address medical needs in the context of mental health, substance use, and housing insecurity.

N2  - Homeless youth experience high rates of suicidal ideation and attempts, yet limited research has examined predictors of treatment engagement among this population. Suicidal homeless youth (N&thinsp;=&thinsp;150) between the ages of 18 and 24 years were recruited from a drop-in center in Columbus, Ohio. Participants were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention&thinsp;+&thinsp;treatment as usual through a local drop-in center (CTSP&thinsp;+&thinsp;TAU) (N&thinsp;=&thinsp;75) or TAU alone (N&thinsp;=&thinsp;75), and treatment attendance among those assigned to CTSP&thinsp;+&thinsp;TAU was examined in this study. As expected, among youth engaged in CTSP&thinsp;+&thinsp;TAU, those with a history of intimate partner violence (IPV) showed decreased odds of treatment attendance. Additionally, youth randomized into CTSP&thinsp;+&thinsp;TAU with higher acquired capability for suicide (ACS) scores and those identifying as Black were more likely to attend treatment sessions. Findings suggest that effective treatment implementation must consider youth's trauma history, demographics and severity of suicidal ideation and behaviors.

N2  - The number of women under community supervision in the United States has increased, and this population has a high risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We examined STI prevalence and multiple risk factors among drug-involved women under community supervision in New York City. Data were from a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of a behavioral HIV/STI intervention (Women on the Road to Health [WORTH]) among drug-involved women in the community corrections system in New York City from 2009 to 2012. To be eligible for inclusion, women had to be under community supervision within the past 90 days, have used illicit drugs at least once in the past six months, and have unprotected sex at least once in the past 90 days. Participants completed a survey containing items on STI risk factors and were tested for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Multivariable regression was used to examine associations between risk factors and STI diagnosis. Of 333 women tested, 89 (26.7%) tested positive for an STI. Ten (3.0%) were positive for C. trachomatis, 4 (1.2%) for N. gonorrhoeae, and 77 (23.1%) for T. vaginalis. Women with any STI were more likely to be black (AOR: 2.02; 95% CI: 1.08&ndash;3.77), homeless in the past 90 days (AOR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.01&ndash;4.26), arrested in the past 90 days (AOR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.14&ndash;3.39), and have a greater number of sexual partners in the past 90 days (AOR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.08&ndash;1.42). Drug-using women under community supervision have a high burden of STIs driven by multiple risk factors. Implementing STI screening, prevention, and treatment programs in community supervision settings could facilitate a reduction in STIs among this population.

N2  - Aims: Homeless mothers with young children in their care contend with high rates of substance use and low self-efficacy. However, a limited number of studies have examined these outcomes associated with housing and supportive services. Design: Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) housing + support services (n = 80), (2) housing-only (n = 80), or (3) services as usual (SAU) (n = 80) and were re-assessed at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months postbaseline. Settings: The study recruited a community-based sample from homeless service agencies and advertisements in a large Midwestern city. Participants: The study recruited two hundred forty (N = 240) women between the ages of 18 to 24 years, experiencing homelessness and with a substance use disorder (SUD) who also had a biological child under the age of 6 years in their care. Measurements: We measured frequency of alcohol and drug use using the Form 90 semi-structured interview, and self-efficacy using Pearlin and Schooler's (1978) 7-item Mastery Scale. Findings: Overall, mothers showed significant improvement in substance use and self-efficacy over time in each condition. However, as expected, patterns of change differentiated intervention groups with more mothers showing better substance use and self-efficacy outcomes in housing + supportive services than in SAU. Unexpectedly, more mothers in SAU showed better outcomes than those in housing-only. Conclusions: Substance use decreased and self-efficacy increased over time, but patterns of change characterized the intervention groups. In particular, findings suggest that when providing housing to this population, supportive services should also be offered.

T1  - Enhancing Milk Consumption by Vulnerable Household Members in Rural Nepal
T2  - Integrated Approach to Enhance Milk Consumption by Vulnerable Household Members in Rural Nepal
Y1  - 2022//
Y2  - 2022//
N2  - Animal-source-foods (ASF) contains nutrients essential to human health. These nutrients are, especially important for vulnerable household members (young children, adolescent girls,, women of child-bearing age [WCBA]). 1, 2 In developing countries, milk is generally one of, the largest sources and most widely consumed animal-based dietary protein 3, Although livestock farmers are more likely than their counterparts to consume ASF 3-5,, paradoxically, families that rely on agriculture and livestock production for their, livelihoods are significantly food and nutrition insecure households. This is partly due to, use of the income earned from livestock for purposes other than improving household diet, diversity and quality, and partly due to inadequate knowledge about the importance of doing, so. In addition, household food allocation practices and cultural beliefs and taboos impact, ASF consumption by individual family members. ASF consumption in Nepal, for example, is often, prioritized for the primary household bread winner (usually an adult male) 6. Thus, multiple, cultural, structural and economic barriers converge to limit consumption of ASF by vulnerable, household memb8rs., Many governmental and non-governmental organizations attempt to improve diet quality in rural, households via nutrition education in hopes of motivating behavior change among participants., However, results of such programs have been inconsistent and generally disappointing 7-9., Even programs which provide a robust agricultural intervention are not always successful in, improving diets or child growth 10, 11. Therefore, the study will define the barriers to, household ASF consumption in rural Nepal and introduce a package of solutions to overcome, these barriers. The design of the intervention builds on prior formative work 1, 12-20 21,, and will be tested in a randomized controlled trial. While young children under 5 years of, age remain a strong focus of this work, adolescent girls, WCBA and fathers will also be, included in the intervention activities., This intervention addresses implementation gaps identified in the investigators' prior work, and incorporates findings in recent literature regarding the effectiveness of specific, behavior change interventions on nutrition outcomes 22. The investigators' previous work, demonstrated that barriers to improving child nutrition are not overcome by increased income,, nutrition education, or enhanced household milk production. Recent work has highlighted the, value of specific components of behavior change programs: (1) demonstrations of how to, perform the behavior, (2) cooking/recipe demonstrations, (3) restructuring the social, environment (e.g., women's groups) and engaging with fathers and other groups not typically, included, (4) providing households with prompts/cues, (5) action planning, goal-setting and, problem-solving, (6) providing information about health consequences, (7) offering strategies, to families to self-monitor behaviors. This planned multi-faceted intervention incorporates, these elements to augment the effectiveness of behavior change messaging provided to, household members, while strengthening community involvement, fostering sustainability and, facilitating scaling-up activities.

N2  - Purpose: Data suggest a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 illness and death among racial and ethnic minorities in the US and that SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic is likely to result in delayed access to HIV treatment, preventive care, and research study visits designed to increase uptake of services. Scant data examine this relationship among Black and Latinx Sexual and Gender Minority Youth (BLSGMY). We examine the COVID-19 vulnerabilities experienced in a sample of BLSGMY enrolled in a randomized control trial (RCT). Methods: 182 BLSGMY, age 15-24, who are at-risk for or living with HIV are enrolled in an RCT in Baltimore, MD; Washington, DC; and Philadelphia, PA. Data was reviewed to examine impact of COVID-19 on completing scheduled study visits. Participants due for a study visit were contacted via telephone, video or text messaging to determine the impact of COVID-19 on their life. Participants were asked about overall well-being, coping and information/resources needed during this time. Data collection is on-going. Results: At the start of COVID, the mean age 21.6 (SD ), with 86% cisgender male, 43% unemployed and 24% unstably housed. 90 participants were due for a study visit between March &ndash; July, 2020. 49 (56.3%) had a delayed study visit (outside their follow up window). We contacted 35 participants who had a delay in their study visit to see how they were impacted by COVID-19. Most (n=32, 90%) described being impacted by COVID-19. Nearly half (n=17, 48%) described economic (e.g., loss of employment, food insecurity, and housing instability), 38% (n=13) described emotional (e.g., fear of COVID-19 exposure, isolation, stress, worry about their health and the future), 14% (n=5) described educational (e.g., difficulty navigating online courses) and 10% (n=4) described medical (e.g., delay in care/medications) impacts and requesting support to be testing. Only 3 participants sought testing, with one diagnosed with COVID-19. Two participants described increased unprotected anal intercourse, with one voicing concern about exposure, and one participant described social isolation which contributed to decreased risky behavior, including fewer sexual partners and decreased marijuana use. Participants were referred to food, unemployment, and medical resources. Conclusions: This work supports findings that COVID-19 significantly impacts BLSGMY by further increasing social and emotional vulnerabilities in an already vulnerable population. In order to address the COVID pandemic, programs that address COVID will need be able to simultaneously focus on low testing engagement and the pre-COVID vulnerabilities (e.g., unstable housing, high unemployment, and poor access to care) that BLSGMY already face.

T1  - Evaluation of the New South Wales Premier's Youth Initiative - A randomised controlled trial to prevent youth homelessness
T2  - Premier&rsquo;s Youth Initiative &mdash; An intervention to prevent homelessness for youth leaving out-of-home care
Y1  - 2018//
Y2  - 2018//
N2  - INTERVENTION: The Premier's Youth Initiative (PYI), PYI aims to reduce youth homelessness for young people leaving out-of-home care (OOHC) in participating regions in New South Wales (NSW). This study aims to investigate whether PYI is effective in preventing or delaying homelessness within the target population., The intervention will consist of multiple components:, - A personal advisor who will support the young person during their transition from OOHC, - Education and employment mentoring, - Accommodation support via subsidised head-leased properties, - Transitional support to assist young people to develop their capacity to independently manage their accommodation needs., PYI is designed as individualised support including ongoing support through a personal advisor, education and/or employment mentoring and additional services. A key element of PYI is hereby the focus on evidence-informed practice integration, i.e., that youth are connected to services based on their needs. Services applying evidence-informed practice will be prioritised. A main focus of PYI is to build young people's capacity to live independently., The initiative was designed by the NSW Department of Family and Community Services (FACS) and the intervention will be delivered by case workers from service provider agencies in collaboration with the personal advisors mentioned above. Hence, the intervention will be delivered as part of the case and support work together with in-person contact with the personal advisor. Additional services will be delivered by provider agencies and mentors as identified in the needs assessment, the leaving care plan and the goals set for the young person leaving care., Duration: The duration of the individual intervention will depend on when children become eligible to participate in the study and the particular needs identified. Overall, the trial is expected to commence in early January 2018 and continue until June 2020., Worker training:, Trained consent workers (case workers or youth service workers) will be asked to consent eligible youth to participate in the study and conduct the baseline data collection. To facilitate the consent process and minimise the likelihood of errors during data collection, we will ask case workers to attend a training session on "Obtaining consent and measuring client outcomes". Training is delivered between September 2017 and February 2018 and is usually conducted on a single day at each site., Participant incentives:, Following usual practice, participants in both the PYI intervention and BAU groups will receive a small contribution, in form of vouchers, for their participation and in compensation for their time. We anticipate that some youth will be difficult to engage in subsequent interviews. To acknowledge their effort and time to continue their participation, the value will increase for the second and third round of data collection., Process evaluation:, The PYI practice model will be refined as part of a process evaluation which will be based on three measures: (1) client satisfaction, (2) implementation fidelity, and (3) perceived barriers and facilitators to implementation. The aim of the process evaluation is to ensure adherence to the PYI practice model and increase program fidelity., CONDITION: Youth homelessness, PRIMARY OUTCOME: Has the client engaged homelessness services?, ;, ; Instrument:, ;  Was the client ever homeless in the trial period?, ;, ; Instrument (adapted from Courtney et al.,, 2017), ;, ; Answer option:, ; &bull; Yes, ; &bull; No, ; &bull; Don&rsquo;t know, ; &bull; Refused, ;, ; Reference: Courtney M, Okpych NJ, Napolitano L, et al. (2017). California Youth transition to adulthood Study. https://ssascholars.uchicago.edu/calyouth/content/study-overview, The client satisfaction will be measured during three rounds in the first year of the outcomes evaluation to assess the perceived quality of service and whether clients feel that their needs are met. Expected sample size for this component will be six clients., Additionally, PYI service providers will be interviewed three times during the first year of the PYI implementation to systematically detect barriers to the implementation of PYI. Target sample size will be six participants working directly with PYI clients, six supervisors of frontline staff and six participants from senior management. The first two components will include semi-structured interviews, conducted by experienced research staff, to collect data., The third component will focus on whether PYI practice model was implemented as intended. For this analysis, information will be collected using fidelity check-lists that will be administered on a quarterly basis., Information collected as part of the process evaluation will feed directly into a continuous quality improvement cycle in form of quarterly recommendations to be implemented by PYI service providers., ; This outcome will be drawn from the administrative data. Each individual&rsquo;s response will be coded and analysed as a binary variable, where if the individual has engaged with homelessness services, they are coded as TRUE and FALSE otherwise., ; Survey question: In the last 12 months have you ever been homeless for one night or longer - that is, have you slept in a homeless refugee or accommodation or in a place where people weren't meant to sleep because you didn't have a place to stay?, ;, SECONDARY OUTCOME: Did the client ever receive alcohol and drug rehabilitation services?, ;, ; Instrument (adapted from Courtney et al., 2017):, ; Survey question: Have you received treatment for an alcohol or substance abuse problem during the past year?, ; Answer options:, ; &bull; Yes, ; &bull; No, ; &bull; Don&rsquo;t know, ; &bull; Refused, ;  Did the client ever receive psychological services?, ;, ; Instrument (adapted from Courtney et al., 2017):, ; Survey question: In the past year, have you received psychological or emotional counselling?, ; Answer options:, ; &bull; Yes, ; &bull; No, ; &bull; Don&rsquo;t know, ; &bull; Refused, ;  Does the client have functional social support?, ;, ; Instrument:, ; Total score across items of the DukeUNC Functional Support Questionnaire (Broadhead, et al., 1988), ;, ; Reference: Broadhead WE, Gehlbach, SH, De Gruy FV, Kaplan BH.

N2  - INTERVENTION: Intervention: Concurrent Treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Substance Use using Prolonged Exposure &ndash; Adolescent version (COPE-A)., COPE-A is an integrated psychological therapy targeting substance use and traumatic stress among adolescents. The therapy will be delivered one-on-one by registered psychologists employed on the project over a maximum of 16 weekly, 60-90 minute, face-to-face sessions. The number of sessions will be based on the psychologist's professional judgement of progress and participants' preferences., The COPE-A program has been adapted from the efficacious adult COPE therapy (Mills et al., 2012; JAMA 308:690-699) to meet the developmental needs of adolescents. COPE-A comprises gold standard cognitive-behavioural techniques (CBT) for traumatic stress and substance use, including imaginal and in vivo exposure., Adolescent participants will have the option of nominating a caregiver to undertake an optional caregiver component. Nominated caregivers who agree to participate will be offered  a maximum of four, 30 minute, individual sessions with the adolescent's psychologist. over the course of the adolescents&rsquo; therapy. The number of sessions will be at the caregivers discretion., Caregiver sessions will comprise psychoeducation about substance use and trauma responses, a rationale for the adolescent program, information about how the caregiver can best support the adolescent through therapy, progress review, and discussion of relapse prevention strategies and aftercare., Therapy sessions will be conducted at times and locations convenient to the participant and employ flexible scheduling to minimise logistical barriers to attendance. Participants will also be reminded of scheduled appointments the day prior (e.g., via phone, text message, email). Therapists will keep a log of adolescent and caregiver session attendance., All trial therapists will undergo study specific training in how to deliver COPE-A including the use of the protocol based treatment manual (3 days, face-to-face, delivered by psychologists experienced in the delivery of CBT for traumatic stress and substance use). Provisions will be made to assure close therapeutic compliance with the treatment manuals used for both the intervention and control conditions: i) therapists will receive regular clinical supervision; ii) the treatment manuals will be taken into each session and a session checklist completed; and iii) with the adolescents&rsquo; consent, all sessions will be audio recorded and reviewed weekly by the Project Coordinator using a checklist to document compliance (a greater than 90% compliance rate will be required); and iv) 10% of each therapist&rsquo;s sessions will be randomly selected and rated for compliance by a blind independent assessor., CONDITION: Substance use Traumatic stress, PRIMARY OUTCOME: Between-group differences in change in the severity of symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as measured by scores on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale - Child and Adolescent version for DSM-5 (CAPS-CA-5)., SECONDARY OUTCOME: Between- and within-session change in craving as measured by a 5-point likert scale.

N2  - Introduction Adolescent nutrition is a crucial period for growth, nutrition and development and serves as an important window for promotion of optimal intergenerational health, nutrition, and well-being as an adult(Patton et al., 2016; Prentice et al., 2013). While maternal and child nutrition have received unprecedented political and financial commitment in recent decades, the emerging focus on policies on programs specific to adolescents (10-19 years), has been accompanied by calls to fill data gaps related to adolescent health and nutrition (Haberland et al., 2018; Bhutta et al., 2017). This analysis aims to describe dietary quality, nutritional status, and other individual and contextual factors related to adolescent nutrition in Nepal. Methods In 2017, utilizing a multi-stage cluster sampling approach, data was collected among 3,648 randomly selected households with a child 0-5 years, from 192 randomly selected program wards. Within these households, in addition to interviewing the mothers and a major household decision-maker, an adolescent girl (n = 837) was also randomly selected for inclusion, when available. We excluded adolescent mothers from the analysis (n = 67). We carried out disaggregated descriptive analyses by age: younger (Y) (10-14 years, n = 515) versus older (O) (15-19 years, n = 255) for nutritional status (BMI-for-age using WHO methodology), diet diversity (using the Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women indicator with a cut-off of 5 + of 10 food groups), nutrition-related health and nutrition exposure, knowledge, and behaviors, and contextual factors such as wealth, caste/ethnicity, number of household members, food security, and school attendance. Results Mean age of adolescent girls participating in the study was 13.7 years (s.d 2.7) and 62% of the girls belonged to the younger age group. Almost half of the adolescents were from socially excluded ethnic group and around 40% resided in food insecure households. The prevalence of overweight/obesity adolescents in this sample was low (3%) among both younger and older girls, but the prevalence of underweight was higher among younger adolescents (Y: 44%, O: 28%, P < 0.001). Similarly, a larger proportion of older adolescent girls attained minimum dietary diversity (Y: 31%, O: 41%, P < 0.01). The prevalence of underweight also varied by agro-ecological zone: hills (Y: 41%, O:48%, P < 0.01) and terai (Y: 12%, O:28%, P < 0.001), as did dietary diversity: hills (Y:49%, O:27%, P < 0.001) and terai (Y:44%, O:31%, P < 0.001). Exposure to both health/family planning (Y: 20%, O: 41%, P < 0.001) and nutrition (Y: 26%, O: 41%, P < 0.05) information differed by age, as did exposure to messages on dietary diversity during pregnancy and lactation (Y: 50%, O: 83%, P < 0.001), ways to delay/ avoid pregnancy (Y: 32%, O: 84%, P < 0.001), and avoiding marriage until 18 years (Y: 83%, O: 97%, P < 0.001). While householdlevel factors were similar between younger and older adolescents, other differences of potential programmatic importance included whether currently in school (Y: 97%, O: 85%, P < 0.001); mobile phone ownership (Y: 7%, O: 50%, P < 0.001); use of radio (Y: 44%, O: 65%, P < 0.001); and whether self-efficacy was above average (Y: 34%, O: 45%, P < 0.001). Conclusions Nutrition-related outcomes and behaviours differ between younger and older adolescent girls in Nepal. Global discourse and research around adolescent health and nutrition requires greater nuance to address the differing circumstances of girls at different stages of adolescence. Consideration of the challenges faced by these sub-groups and how to reach and tailor interventions (e.g., schools, radio, SMS) could serve as vital next steps.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Identify moderators of treatment outcome from antipsychotic pharmacotherapy in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) trial. Specifically, we used logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to explore the association between baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes in the CATIE trial., METHOD: This is a secondary analysis of the CATIE trial in which 1,460 adults with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia were randomly assigned to olanzapine, perphenazine, quetiapine, risperidone, or ziprasidone treatment for up to 18 months or until discontinuation between January 2001 and December 2004. Logistic regression was used to examine baseline characteristics associated with remission, response, and treatment continuation at 3 and 6 months of treatment. ROC analyses identified subgroups associated with similar likelihood of treatment outcome. Remission was defined by scores of selected items on psychoticism, disorganization, and negative symptoms. Response was defined as a 50% or greater improvement on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale., RESULTS: The most consistent predictors of poor outcome on all variables were low scores on neurocognitive tests (in particular verbal memory) (OR = 1.13-1.49, P< .05); previous reported side effects (OR = 0.49-0.69, P < .05); negative attitude to medication (OR = 1.03-1.10, P < .05); comorbid depression (OR = 0.47-0.51, P < .05); psychosocial factors such as unemployment (OR = 0.74-0.75, P <.05), homelessness (OR = 0.54, P <.05), and living alone (OR = 1.58-1.94, P < .01); and random assignment to a medication other than olanzapine (OR = 1.54-2.04, P < .01). ROC analysis demonstrated prognostic subgroups with large differences in response likelihood., CONCLUSION: Baseline characteristics in schizophrenia are informative regarding clinically important treatment outcomes with respect to antipsychotic pharmacotherapy. Further research should examine whether interventions that target improvement of patients' deficits in neuropsychological function and attitude toward medication as well as decreasing patients' social isolation can improve treatment outcomes with antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00014001.

Y2  - 2017//
N2  - The study uses a multi-site randomized group trial (RGT) cohort design to evaluate the Project Legacy intervention curriculum for reducing sexual risk behaviors among homeless youth age 14-19. CHLA project staff will work with 6 homeless youth serving sites in Southern California (Los Angeles, San Diego) to recruit 600 youth. Randomization to the intervention or control condition will occur at the group level and will be stratified by site. Field staff will survey all eligible homeless youth who provide consent to participate in the study at baseline (before randomization and implementation) and at 3 and 9 months post intervention (5-5.5 and 11-11.5 months post-baseline). The program group will receive an additional intervention-based survey immediately upon completion of the program., Youth in the control condition will receive the normal standard of care provided at the recruitment sites. Services available as standard of care at the recruitment sites include: medical care; mental health services; substance abuse services; educational, career, and vocational services. Intervention participants will not be excluded from receiving these services as well. Surveys will capture mental and physical health care service utilization and services to reduce substance use across both groups. The study team will monitor HIV and pregnancy prevention programming and other similar goal-planning/decision-making interventions offered to homeless youth in the study areas during the program implementation and follow-up period via interviews with site staff. The study team will include selected program exposure items on the follow up surveys to assess youth's self-reported exposure to similar goal-planning/decision-making and sexual health (pregnancy prevention and STI/HIV) education.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: "Housing First" has been shown to improve housing stability in homeless individuals with mental illness, but had not been empirically tested in homeless youth. We aimed to evaluate the effect of "Housing First" on housing stability in homeless youth aged 18 to 24 years participating in At Home/Chez Soi, a 24-month randomized trial of "Housing First" in 5 Canadian cities., METHODS: Homeless individuals with mental illness were randomized to receive "Housing First" (combined with assertive community treatment or intensive case management depending on their level of need) or treatment as usual. We defined our primary outcome, housing stability, as the percent of days stably housed as a proportion of days for which residence data were available., RESULTS: Of 2148 participants who completed baseline interviews and were randomized, 7% (n = 156) were youth aged 18 to 24 years; 87 received "Housing First" and 69 received treatment as usual. In an adjusted analysis, youth in "Housing First" were stably housed a mean of 437 of 645 (65%) days for which data were available compared with youth in treatment as usual, who were stably housed a mean of 189 of 582 (31%) days for which data were available, resulting in an adjusted mean difference of 34% (95% confidence interval, 24%-45%; P < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: "Housing First" was associated with improved housing stability in homeless youth with mental illness. Future research should explore whether adaptations of the model for youth yield additional improvements in housing stability and other outcomes.

N2  - Background: Inadequate complementary feeding (CF) is recognized as a cause of growth failure, but there is considerable variability in the ability of interventions to impact growth through CF practices. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a feeding toolkit which aims to improve child growth through improved meal frequency, meal volume and food consistency in rural Malawi. Methods: Households in Mchinji district, Malawi with a child aged 6 to 17 months were selected via single stage cluster sampling based on caregivers' participation in community women's groups; 923 households from 53 communities completed a baseline survey in July/August 2015 and an endline survey in June 2016. In October/November of 2015, women's groups were randomized to either the intervention or control, with households in intervention communities eligible to receive a feeding toolkit consisting of a feeding bowl with demarcations and symbols that cued age-appropriate meal frequency and volume; a slotted spoon designed to promote optimal porridge consistency; and nutrition education. Caregivers in the control groups received nutrition education. Logistic and linear regression was used to assess the impact of the feeding toolkit on CF practices and changes in child weight- and height-for-age (WAZ, HAZ) and weight-forheight (WHZ) z-scores adjusted for covariates. Results: The mean child age at endline was 21.3 &plusmn; 3.3 months, with 51% female. Receipt of the toolkit was associated with increased meal volume (&bgr;=30 ml, 95% CI 14 ml, 46 ml) but not with the odds of meeting minimum dietary diversity (P=0.6) or minimum acceptable diet (P=0.7). There was evidence of interaction between toolkit receipt and food security for minimum meal frequency (P=0.06) and consistency (P=0.07). The toolkit improved odds of minimum meal frequency (OR=1.55, 95% CI 1.10, 2.16) and was associated with increased meal thickness (&bgr;=0.24, 95% CI 0.12, 0.36) but only among moderate or severely food insecure households. There was a trend toward improved HAZ in children who received the toolkit (&bgr;=0.12, 95% CI=-0.01, 0.26, P = 0.07), but there were no associations with WAZ (P=0.6) or WHZ (P=0.3). Conclusion: A feeding bowl and spoon with nutrition education was associated with improved meal volume in all households, and improved meal frequency and consistency in the most food insecure households. Further studies are warranted to understand the impact of such an intervention on linear growth.

T1  - WelTelOAKTREE: text Messaging to Support Patients With HIV/AIDS in British Columbia
Y1  - 2015//
Y2  - 2015//
N2  - Purpose:, To provide a weekly text messaging intervention to 85 high risk HIV+ participants attending the Oak Tree HIV Clinic in order to improve medication adherence, attendance at appointments and subsequently, CD4 counts and HIV viral load values over a 1 year period., Justification:, The investigators have completed one of the first studies of text messaging support for HIV care in Canada. The pilot study called WelTelBC1 involved 25 individuals from five patient groups 1) Non-suppressed (CD4 <200, VL >250); 2) Youth (ages 14-24); 3) Mature (Age &ge;50); 4) English as a second language; and 5) Distance (those residing 3+ hours travel time from the clinic), who receive a weekly text message asking them "How are you?" Participants were then instructed to respond with "OK" or to let the investigators know if they had a problem. Participants who responded that they are "not okay" or did not respond were then followed up by a clinic nurse. The pilot study was designed to look at feasibility and acceptability of the weekly text messaging intervention in a Canadian HIV+ population, and resulted showed that the intervention was been perceived as beneficial among participants. In regards to acceptability, the pilot study has been extremely informative, and has enabled investigators to engage participants previously only seen sporadically; overcoming gaps that prevent optimal care and follow-up. In addition, we have seen from our pilot project, that to reach those in most need of a link to care we need to be prepared to provide cell phones and phone plan support to those without one (only 50% of those enrolled in our intervention owned a cell phone, and only 40% had unlimited text messaging - anecdotally these are the patients with whom engagement has most improved during the intervention). It is now critical to expand this program to all individuals at Oak Tree Clinic who could benefit and to study the efficacy of this intervention in engaging patients in care and improving adherence to HAART., Research Method:, Additionally, study participants were asked to complete a Quality of Life Assessment (QOL) questionnaire (the SF-12 questionnaire) at study entry (0 months), mid-way through study (6 months +/- 6 weeks) and at study exit (12 months +/- 6 weeks). The questionnaire consisted of 12 questions; was self-administered or interviewer administered; and took between 10 -15 minutes to complete., Intervention:, Data Collection:, In Canada, around 65,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS, approximately 14,300 of whom are women. AntiRetroviral Therapy (ART) has led to enormous improvements in the health and survival of individuals with HIV. Moreover, by decreasing the amount of virus circulating in the body (viral load), HAART offers the possibility of treatment as a preventative measure. However, high levels of engagement in care, timely initiation of ARVs, and adherence to medication are required to maximize the benefits of HAART in order to prevent resistance, progression to AIDS, transmission or mortality. Unfortunately, engagement in ongoing HIV care can be poor, with one study from the United States (US) showing only 52% retention in care over 1 year. Further, adherence among high-risk populations is low, with women being less adherent partly due to their role as care providers for children and partners, potential abuse in partner relationships, fear of stigma, homelessness, and concerns regarding side effects. Conversely, active drug use (especially cocaine), lack of social supports, and depression are just a few of the variables that affect both men and women alike. Current methods of engagement in care have failed to overcome these barriers to adherence, which makes finding an effective adherence intervention critically important. Mobile health (mHealth), the use of mobile phone technology to deliver health care, is an emerging area of disease management that can assist in patient adherence to prolonged chronic treatment regimens and monitoring of care. A randomized controlled trial (WelTelKenya1), conducted by Dr. Richard Lester et. al, tested the clinical effectiveness of text message support for HIV treatment adherence in Kenya. WelTelKenya1, of which 67% were women, showed that patients receiving text message support had significantly higher rates of treatment adherence and viral suppression than patients who received standard care alone. In Canada, cell phone penetration exceeds 70% and is expected to reach 100% within the next decade. The WelTel system offers a clinical management model that can be carried out using standard services offered by cellular network providers with minimal additional infrastructure and is both flexible and scalable., Participant Selection and Recruitment: A list of patients with a CD4 count &les;500 or previous prescription for antiretroviral therapy (other than for pregnancy) prior to the control year, as well as a detectable viral load (&ge;200) in the control year was assembled. The list was reviewed by the clinic physicians, nurse, pharmacist, dietician, counselor, outreach worker and social worker to determine which patients would benefit most from participating in the WelTel text messaging program (i.e. poor engagement in care, difficult to contact, poor or non-adherence to ARV therapy, advanced HIV infection/AIDS, vulnerable or socially isolated patients). A consensus based approach was used for patient selection. In addition, all 25 of the Oak Tree pilot study participants (WelTelBC1), were invited into the current study. Once nominated, when patients attended clinic for a clinical visit, they were introduced to the WelTel intervention concept. Those interested were approached by research staff for a full explanation. The intervention protocol was the same as that used for the WelTelBC1 pilot study at Oak Tree, developed through use of patient questionnaires as well as patient and health care worker focus groups/interviews at Oak Tree, and yet very similar to the intervention used in the initial WelTelKenya1 intervention. Following fully informed consenting with completion of consent forms, participants were provided with a cell phone with unlimited text messaging if they did not have one, or if they had their own cell phone, had their plan topped up to include unlimited text messaging service. Baseline clinical data including historical CD4 counts, and HIV viral loads were abstracted from patient charts., The intervention protocol was the same as that used for the WelTelBC1 pilot study. This was modeled on the WelTelKenya1 intervention but adapted to the Oak Tree Clinic patient population through the use of patient questionnaires as well as patient and health care worker focus group and individual interviews. Each Monday, patients received a text message from a number not traceable to the clinic stating simply "How are you?" Patients were instructed to respond to the message if they are "OK" or to state that they have a problem. Messages were reviewed and triaged daily by our program research team member and in all cases of a negative or complex response other than OK, participants were contacted by the program nurse (patients were instructed that this is NOT an emergency service). Non-responders received a second text message on Wednesday at 12:00 pm (48 hours after the initial text sent out), and if there was no response, were contacted by the program nurse Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning for follow-up., Participants wiwere asked their ethnicity at study enrolment. Participants were also asked to complete a 12 question QOL assessment questionnaire at study entry, mid-way through the study and at study end. Frequency of attendance in care was assessed from the outpatient clinic electronic booking system. Chart abstraction of clinical health status included: participant age (in years), housing status, current illicit drug use and postal code, CD4 counts and percentages, HIV viral loads, antiretroviral drug (ARV) regimen (including date of initiation or discontinuation), and degree of medication adherence (as determined from timing of ARV refills, and self-report), which was collected at baseline then at each clinical visit for the following one year. All available like data for one year prior (up to 2 years if in the Pilot Study) to enrollment in the WelTel program was alsocollected such that participants served as their own controls in the intervention (repeated measures study), and for the year following the intervention to assess the longevity of the intervention's impacts. Staff costs / savings were calculated by looking at Pharmacy, Nursing and Outreach worker time used both prior to and throughout the intervention. The planned duration of the intervention was one year, and of the study, 18 months. At that time data was analyzed and the program evaluated.

N2  - Substance abuse, mental and physical health problems among street living youth are significant issues for those that serve this population. However, there is a dearth of research focused on addressing substance use and related problems among these youth. In this study, youth were recruited from a drop-in center. Participants completed a pretreatment, 3 and 6-month follow-up assessment. Youth were randomly assigned to either service as usual (SAU) through the drop-in center (case management), or community reinforcement approach (CRA) therapy, a 12-session, behaviorally oriented individual therapy. As CRA targets many areas of change directly (substance use, social stability, related problems), it was expected that positive change on the outcome measures would be greater for youth at post-treatment in CRA compared to SAU. Preliminary analyses were conducted on the differential change between CRA and SAU groups. To date, 118 clients (62 CRA, 56 SAU) have completed pre and post-treatment assessments. Due to low power, only the pre and post-treatment assessments were used in the following analyses. An interaction between group and percent days of alcohol and drug use was found (F (1, 116) = 4.24, p <.05); youth assigned to CRA showed a greater reduction in substance use (38% decrease) compared to SAU (16% decrease). Social stability (percent days of work, education, medical care, living off of the streets) showed a trend toward an interaction (F (1, 116) = 3.61, p = .06), with CRA increasing significantly but not SAU. Other measures showed an overall time effect (both groups got better), including, condom attitudes, depression, problem consequences of drug/alcohol use, HIV knowledge, delinquency, internalizing and externalizing behaviors. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive treatment outcome pilot study with homeless substance abusing youth and findings show the positive impact or efficacy of the intervention (CRA) on this difficult to serve population. These preliminary findings provide support to continuing efforts to tailor and improve treatment services to homeless youth.

N2  - A federally-funded research project for the Bridge Independent Living Project was designed to determine whether this structured residential program would have significant impact on the lives of 16- and 17-year-old homeless youth as compared to a similar control group. A non-equivalent control group design was employed in which youth referred to the independent living project were assessed on several personality dimensions before entering the program and at a 6-14 month follow-up. Instruments used were the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, the Lanyon Psychological Screening Inventory, and the Rotter Locus of Control Scale. Data were also collected on education and employment status, living situation, and behavior problems. Control youth from whom the same data were collected received other services from Bridge including counseling, General Educational Development, and vocational programs, but were living at home, with friends, or in other residential programs. Demographic data and entry assessment information were collected on 21 program and 36 control youth. One year follow-up data were available for 12 program and 18 control youth. At follow-up, program youth showed statistically significant gains in self-concept and became significantly less defensive than control youth. There was a trend in program youth toward less alienation or emotional problems compared to control youth, but no significant changes in sense of personal control for program youth. Program youth were found to be significantly more often employed and in school or had obtained a high school diploma, and were significantly more often in stable living situations than were control youth. Numerous tables and the survey forms are included. (NB) [By permission, ERIC Processing and Reference Facility, US Department of Education]

T1  - Mobile Intervention for Young Opioid Users
T2  - Preventing Injection: an mHealth Intervention That Leverages Social Networks to Prevent Progression to Injection Among Young Opioid Users
Y1  - 2018//
Y2  - 2018//
N2  - Opioid use disorders (OUD) are the second most common type of drug use disorder in the US, with nearly 2 million reporting prescription opioid (PO) use and, The current application is being submitted in response to PA 16-073, "Behavioral and Integrative Treatment Development Program." The proposed project is a Stage Ib study that will adapt a mobile, evidence-based psychosocial intervention for opioid dependence (Check-In App) to prevent progression to injection in young opioid users (18-29 y/o) who have not progressed to regular injection., Aim 1: During months 1-12, we will adapt the Check-In App to target reducing opioid use and preventing progression to injection among young oral / intranasal opioid users. We will tailor our existing mHealth intervention (including daily text messages plus key components of evidence-based cognitive behavioral interventions, Functional Analysis of Drug Use, Self-Management, and Social / Recreational Counseling), for young opioid users. New components specific to youth will focus on the role of peers in opioid use / IDU, and OD prevention / response training including use of naloxone. Our iterative development process will include focus groups with opioid-using youth (n=24), interviews with important stakeholders (e.g., youth treatment providers; n=6), and feedback and usability data from opioid-using youth (n=30)., Aim 2: During months 13-31, we will conduct a small randomized, controlled trial of the newly tailored mHealth intervention with young opioid users (18-29 y/o) who have not transitioned to regular injection (n=64) and compare (1) assessment plus in-person OD prevention / response training (including naloxone) versus (2) assessment plus in-person OD prevention / response training (including naloxone) plus the Preventing Injection Application. We will evaluate the intervention's feasibility, acceptability, diffusion, and preliminary effectiveness. Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed via participant feedback, retention, and app usage data. Diffusion will be defined as the number of participants' peers who download the intervention app for their own use. Preliminary effectiveness will be measured via reductions in opioid use (TLFB, urine and hair toxicology) and self-reported injection status at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and 3 and 6 month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include HIV/HCV risk behavior, OD episodes, opioid-related problems (e.g., withdrawal episodes), and social network IDU-related norms and behaviors., If results are promising, this intervention will be evaluated in a large-scale efficacy / effectiveness trial. This intervention may have tremendous impact on improving access, acceptability, and potency of opioid use interventions for youth, given the extremely widespread use of mobile apps among young adults (98% of 18-29 y/o own mobile phones and spend, 3 hr/day using mobile apps)., 570,000 reporting heroin use consistent with an OUD. Further, drug overdose (OD) has become the leading cause of accidental death in the US, with opioid-involved OD driving this epidemic. The recent escalation in OUD has been most pronounced among youth, with nearly 1/3 of youth reporting PO misuse by age 21, and studies have documented the trajectory from PO misuse to injection drug use (IDU) in youth. An ongoing study conducted by the current investigators documented an alarming trajectory, wherein these youth progress from nonmedical PO use in adolescence (first PO use M=16.7 y/o), to oral / intranasal heroin use in young adulthood (M=19.1 y/o), with 64% progressing to injection drug use (IDU), within a year of heroin initiation (first injection M=20.1 y/o. This progression to IDU is characterized by uniquely high levels of risk for youth, including higher rates of injection risk behaviors and OD, and higher incidence of HIV and HCV within the first few years of transitioning to injection, compared to older peers. Thus, young opioid users are at uniquely high risk for a number of negative outcomes during the critical period of transitioning to injection. This rapid progression from PO use to IDU and the extreme risk associated with new injection status among youth indicate that there is a brief, but critical, period during which we may intervene to prevent progression to injection and its associated risk behaviors and negative health outcomes. Several robust predictors have been found for progression to IDU, including psychosocial factors (i.e., homelessness, physical abuse), OUD severity (i.e., dependence severity, polydrug use), and IDU norms and behaviors within one's social network. While there is some understanding of the mechanisms that promote IDU, there is virtually no research on strategies to prevent this transition. Only one intervention has been examined targeting intranasal heroin users in an attempt to prevent progression to IDU. This "sniffers" intervention found potent effects; half as many intervention participants progressed to injection (33% vs. 16%), compared to the control condition (who received HIV/AIDS education), indicating that direct intervention with opioid users may be an effective way to prevent progression to IDU and its associated harms. It is unclear why so few interventions have targeted this population, although young opioid users face a number of unique barriers, including social, economic, and motivational, that may prevent them from seeking and receiving treatment. Given the paucity of interventions available to the large and vulnerable group of opioid-using young adults, there is an urgent need to develop and evaluate innovative, engaging approaches to prevent young opioid users from transitioning to IDU.

N2  - Cognitive impairments are common in homeless youth and negatively impact academic and vocational outcomes. We examined the feasibility and efficacy of cognitive interventions provided to 18- to 22-year-old homeless youth living in urban supportive housing. Ninety-one homeless youth were randomized to receive either targeted cognitive training (cognitive remediation) or general cognitive activation (computer skills training). Cognitive and psychological outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 13 and 26 sessions, and 1 month postintervention. A high dropout rate highlighted the feasibility challenges of treating this population. Intent-to-treat analysis found significant improvements across groups in specific and global measures of cognition and psychological distress, with no significant group differences. Transition-age homeless youth show improvements in cognitive and psychological functioning when engaged in interventions that address their cognitive development. This speaks to the malleability of cognitive skills in this cohort and lays the groundwork for future research to address their cognitive health.

N2  - The overarching goal of this application is to evaluate a comprehensive intervention for the prevention of opioid use disorder and for increasing other resilient outcomes in this special population of high-risk young adults. Phase I of the study includes a nonrandomized pilot study with a sample of 21 youth to assess initial efficacy, feasibility of recruitment and acceptability of the housing + opioid and related risk prevention services. Upon meeting transition milestones, 240 youth will be randomized into housing + opioid and related risk prevention services versus opioid and related risk prevention services alone for Phase II. In this study, we seek to determine if adding housing to opioid and related risk prevention services yields a significant benefit above and beyond the benefit yielded by opioid and related risk prevention services alone. Phase II follow-up will be conducted at 3, 6, 9 and 12-months post-baseline to assess stability of effects. Sample inclusion criteria, recruitment and screening will be identical for both phases, as described below. The unique components of Phase I and Phase II are then described separately., Sample Inclusion Criteria., 1. We will include youth between the ages of 18 to 24 years. Our experience is that      landlords will not accept leases signed by youth ages 16-17 years. "Homeless youth"      commonly refers to those up to the age of 24 years (Robertson & Toro, 1999; USICH,      2010), thus, this age range generally reflects the age range of the homeless youth      population served by providers across the country., 2. Youth meets the criteria for homelessness as defined by the federal McKinney-Vento Act      (2002) as "lacking a fixed, regular, stable, and adequate nighttime residence" and      includes "living in a publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide      temporary living accommodations, or a public or private place not designed for, or      ordinarily used as, regular sleeping accommodations for human beings.", 3. Youth fails to meet DSM 5 criteria for Opioid Use Disorder as assessed by the SCID      (First et al., 2015)., Screening and intake. Project staff will maintain offices within the drop-in center. Youth who are engaged on the streets will be transported to the drop-in center. An RA will engage and screen youth to determine basic eligibility for the study. After the brief screening and stated interest in the project, written consent will be obtained and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders (SCID) (First, Williams, Karg, & Spitzer, 2015) section on Opioid Use Disorder, will be administered to determine formal eligibility., Phase I: Quantitative Analysis. Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to test the efficacy of the intervention (time effects). Three testing occasions (e.g., baseline, 3, and 6 months) will be the within-subject dependent variables. The primary outcome is opioid use, and secondary outcomes are listed below under "dependent variables." It is predicted that there will be a main effect of time; youth will show reductions in opioid use, and improved functioning in other domains at post-intervention (6-months)., Participant recruitment and sample availability. Columbus is ranked the 16th largest city in the U.S. Many consider Columbus a "typical" American city because of the mix of races, range of incomes, urban, suburban, and nearby rural areas. Columbus has one drop-in center for homeless youth between the ages of 14-24 years (founded by MPI Slesnick). Last year (2018) approximately 1200 unduplicated homeless youth between the ages of 14-24 years were served at the drop-in center, with 70-95% of homeless youth reporting problem substance use, similar to national samples (e.g., Baer et al., 2003). The single adult shelters have a total of 457 beds for single men and 97 for single women on any given night. Service-connected youth will be recruited from the drop-in and adult shelters, non-service connected youth will be recruited through outreach to local soup kitchens, sandwich lines, the streets, parks and library. Given the high rates of homeless youth in Columbus, we do not anticipate any recruitment problems., Community Engagement. Too often, interventions do not reach those for whom the interventions were developed (Spoth & Greenberg, 2005). Implementation science promotes the integration of research in to practice and policy, with implementation science studies often focused on investigating the bottlenecks that impede the uptake and adoption of interventions. Several calls have sought to transform translational science so that research supported interventions can quickly reach the targeted populations in need (Fogarty International Center, 2013), with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) noting that "there is no time to lose" (IOM, 1999). The IOM has emphasized a greater focus on engaging community stakeholders from the earliest phases of research, as such continuous involvement improves dissemination and uptake (Spoth & Greenberg, 2005). Indeed, multiple guidelines and lessons learned from dissemination of evidence-based interventions have been published (e.g., Collins & Sapiano, 2016). Standards for dissemination include that the program has the ability to go to scale, has training and technical support available, and a statement of the causal mechanisms relating the intervention to the outcome (Flay et al., 2005). This study will provide a solid base for the next step in translating research to practice and policy. At the end of the study, the materials and knowledge will be in place to conduct an effectiveness or broad-based dissemination effort., The Community Advisory Group, including homeless providers, homeless youth, landlords, substance use treatment experts and policy makers will meet throughout the project period, shaping study procedures, and easing transition of intervention to practice by the end of the study. Furthermore, Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH) has led several large housing initiatives in the city, and MPI Kelleher's primary appointment is with NCH, where he works with the City, United Way and housing developers. Engagement will continue beyond the study period between researchers and community partners in order to support implementation of the prevention intervention. Also, at the end of the study period, a conference will be held at The Ohio State University to engage executive directors and their staff from drop-in centers from around the country, as well as other homeless youth researchers and providers., Phase I (UG3) Using the same recruitment strategy, eligibility criteria and assessment package (including stress biomarkers) as Phase II, a non-randomized pilot of the housing + opioid and related risk prevention services intervention (N = 21) will be completed in year 1. The sample size of 21 reflects three months of recruitment of seven youth/month. All youth will receive the 6-month housing + opioid and related prevention services intervention. Youth will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6-months using the proposed assessment battery, and qualitative interviews. The primary purpose of this phase is to document feasibility of recruitment, acceptability of the intervention, and initial pre-post change on targeted outcome measures. However, other activities, including creating a base of landlords to provide rentals to youth and initiating the Community Advisory Group, will also be a focus. As the housing + prevention services and assessment battery are identical in Phase 1 and Phase II, they are described in detail following the description of Phase II. Those aspects unique to Phase I are discussed immediately below., Phase I: Assessment of acceptability, feasibility and initial efficacy of the intervention. Several studies assess intervention acceptability, feasibility and initial efficacy using similar procedures to those described below (von Haastregt et al., 2007; Zlotnick et al., 2003). Acceptability of the intervention will be assessed by the retention of youths in the intervention, the total number of advocacy sessions attended, length of time remaining in project supported housing, and by the percentage of eligible youth who agree to participate in the study. In addition, the extent to which landlords consent to continuing participation in the second phase of the trial is essential. Assessment of feasibility includes documentation of 1) whether participants can be recruited, engaged, and maintained in the housing + opioid and related risk prevention services as proposed, data which can be obtained from RA screening forms and advocate records (meetings attended, maintenance of housing), and 2) whether the timeline proposed for housing youths (anticipated to average 4 weeks, and time to housing will be tracked) and other intervention procedures can be maintained as proposed. In order to estimate initial efficacy, we will assess youth at baseline, 3 and 6-months to determine change in identified targeted outcomes (e.g. opioid and other substance use, homelessness and related problems). In addition to the quantitative analysis, qualitative interviews with each youth will provide a fuller understanding of the youths' response to the intervention., Phase I: Qualitative Analysis. In order to increase our understanding of youths' response to the intervention such as experiences associated with differing levels of housing success and satisfaction with services, each youth at 6 months post-baseline will be interviewed regarding their experiences in the study. Supplementing the quantitative findings, interviews can provide better understanding of factors that promote engagement and success among youth as well as factors that prevented youth from successfully maintaining their housing. Additionally, qualitative data can help explain any unexpected findings, and provide a greater richness when reporting and interpreting the quantitative outcomes. Dr. Brittany Brakenhoff conducted a mixed methods study (funded by NIDA, R36DA041530) in which youth were interviewed regarding their perceptions of barriers to safe sex. She is an expert in qualitative methods and will lead the qualitative data collection. The qualitative portion will follow a phenomenological approach, which provides a framework for collecting and analyzing qualitative data as a way to better understand how youth experienced the intervention providing insight into youths' perceptions of whether they benefited from the intervention in a way that was meaningful to them (Creswell, 2012). Youth will be asked about their overall experience in the research study as well as their perception of how the intervention impacted their life. Youth will be asked to discuss aspects of the intervention they benefited from, aspects they did not find helpful, and how to make the intervention more helpful. All interviews will be independently coded by three members of the research team and discrepancies in coding will be discussed until an agreement is reached. NVivo 11 (QSR international) will be used to assist with coding. Member checking will provide additional verification of the results, a subsample of 5 youth who participated in the non-randomized pilot will be asked to review and provide feedback on the initial qualitative findings. While quantitative data can show whether participants changed their behavior, qualitative data can determine if those changes actually resulted in perceived meaningful improvements in the participants' lives.

N2  - Runaway and homeless youth are at risk for HIV based upon their rates of substance use, particularly injection drug use, unprotected sexual intercourse, multiple partners, and sexually transmitted diseases. Risk increases as the time away from home increases. STRIVE is a family intervention aimed at increasing residential stability, decreasing runaway episodes, and decreasing HIV risk. Families are randomly assigned to a cognitive-behavioral skills-building intervention consisting of five weekly sessions delivered at family homes, or are assigned to standard care. Sessions are aimed at increasing problem solving, role clarity, and positive interactions. It is hypothesized that the intervention will result in improved family dynamics, less runaway behavior, and less risky behavior.

N2  - Comprehensive intervention for homeless, street living youth that addresses substance use, social stability, physical and mental health issues has received very little attention. In this study, street living youth aged 14-22 were recruited from a drop-in center and randomly assigned to the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) or treatment as usual (TAU) through a drop-in center. Findings showed that youth assigned to CRA, compared to TAU, reported significantly reduced substance use (37% vs. 17% reduction), depression (40% vs. 23%) and increased social stability (58% vs. 13%). Youth in both conditions improved in many other behavioral domains including substance use, internalizing and externalizing problems, and emotion and task oriented coping. This study indicates that homeless youth can be engaged into treatment and respond favorably to intervention efforts. However, more treatment development research is needed to address the barriers associated with serving these youth.

N2  - Youth (ages 18-21) living at a local youth shelter will be recruited and randomly assigned to receive the SAFE intervention (plus usual case management) or to receive usual case management only. Those assigned to SAFE will receive 12 mindfulness-based, cognitive-behavioral modules through a 3-day intensive group intervention provided by an agency intern and a hired project staff member. The intervention uses mindfulness-based cognitive-behavioral approaches to augment youth attention to risk-related processes, including risk detection, problem solving, assertiveness, and help seeking skills. It is hypothesized the intervention will result in reduced substance use and victimization and that these effects will be explained, at least in part, by improved risk-related attention skills (risk detection, problem solving, assertiveness, and help seeking skills). Post baseline interview, participants will be randomly assigned and will participate in a posttest interview (1 week post baseline) and follow up interviews at 6-weeks, 3-months, and 6-months post baseline interview.

N2  - PURPOSE: We evaluate the efficacy of a short family intervention in reducing sexual risk behavior, drug use, and delinquent behaviors among homeless youth., METHODS: A randomized controlled trial of 151 families with a homeless adolescent aged 12 to 17 years. Between March 2006 and June 2009, adolescents were recruited from diverse sites in Southern California and were assessed at recruitment (baseline), and at 3, 6, and 12 months later. Families were randomly assigned to an intervention condition with five weekly home-based intervention sessions or a control condition (standard care). Main outcome measures reflect self-reported sexual risk behavior, substance use, and delinquent behaviors over the past 90 days., RESULTS: Sexual risk behavior (e.g., mean number of partners; p < .001), alcohol use (p = .003), hard drug use (p < .001), and delinquent behaviors (p = .001) decreased significantly more during 12 months in the intervention condition compared with the control condition. Marijuana use, however, significantly increased in the intervention condition compared with the control condition (p < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: An intervention to reengage families of homeless youth has significant benefits in reducing risk over 12 months.

N2  - Family factors, such as poor family functioning and trauma, have been associated with negative outcomes for homeless adolescents. Further study is needed to better understand how family factors and trauma jointly relate to mental health problems and externalizing behaviors among homeless adolescents. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the influence of trauma (encompassing traumatic events experienced prior to, and after, becoming homeless) and family factors (poor family functioning and family conflict) on mental health problems and externalizing behaviors (substance use, delinquent behaviors, and sexual risk) among 201 homeless adolescents, ages 12 to 17 years. Trauma, poor family functioning, and family conflict significantly predicted greater mental health problems, delinquent behaviors, high-risk sexual behaviors and substance use. Overall, the findings suggest that family factors appear to be key to understanding mental health problems and externalizing behaviors among homeless adolescents. Implications, limitations and future directions are addressed.

N2  - We designed and pilot-tested a group-based, work-related cognitive-. behavioral therapy (WCBT) for unemployed individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD). WCBT, delivered in a vocational service setting by vocational service professionals, aims to reduce social anxiety and enable individuals to seek, obtain, and retain employment. We compared WCBT to a vocational services as usual control condition (VSAU). Participants were unemployed, homeless, largely African American, vocational service-seeking adults with SAD (N=58), randomized to receive either eight sessions of WCBT plus VSAU or VSAU alone and followed three months post-treatment. Multilevel modeling revealed significantly greater reductions in social anxiety, general anxiety, depression, and functional impairment for WCBT compared to VSAU. Coefficients for job search activity and self-efficacy indicated greater increases for WCBT. Hours worked per week in the follow-up period did not differ between the groups, but small sample size and challenges associated with measuring work hours may have contributed to this finding. Overall, the results of this study suggest that unemployed persons with SAD can be effectively treated with specialized work-related CBT administered by vocational service professionals. Future testing of WCBT with a larger sample, a longer follow-up period, and adequate power to assess employment outcomes is warranted.

T1  - Adapting Mental Health Interventions for War-Affected Youth Through Employment Programs
T2  - Adapting Mental Health Interventions for War-Affected Youth Through Employment Programs in Sierra Leone
Y1  - 2015//

N2  - In Sierra Leone, a dangerous gap remains between long-term psychosocial needs and adequate services. As youth affected by the war begin to enter adulthood, they face new challenges including unemployment, interrupted education, the need to support families, marginalization and stigma, as well as the remaining psychological effects of exposure to war. Healthy social integration is critical to the long-term wellbeing of this generation, but the evidence base on effective interventions to improve skills and self-efficacy is severely limited. Despite the high burden of mental health problems among war-affected youth in Sub-Saharan Africa, few empirically-supported behavioral treatments (ESBTs) or evidence-based interventions have been implemented in this region. This study stands to make an important contribution to knowledge on effective and culturally-sensitive mental health services that can be implemented in settings fraught by multiple hardships, including war, poverty, low educational attainment, and other hardships., This exploratory randomized control study of youth aged 15-24 comparing outcomes among youth participating in YRI proceeding enrollment in an income generating activity program (YRI + EP) to a control group that participates only in income generating activity programs (EP). This study is not fully powered to detect differences between groups and is instead a test of the intervention feasibility and acceptability, with quantitative participant assessments occurring at baseline, 3-months, 6-months, and 12-months with respect to employment related measures, and participant and interventionists interviews to elucidate mechanisms by which the intervention was more or less successful., The YRI is an evidence-based group intervention developed in 2010 to address key emotional, behavioral, and functioning difficulties identified by the PI's prior longitudinal study of war-affected youth. The YRI has three overarching goals: (1) To improve interpersonal and community relationships through work with youth and community members; (2) To help vulnerable youth develop skills in emotional regulation, problem-solving, and interpersonal interactions necessary to be successful members of their communities; (3) To promote the healthy integration of difficult memories for youth who experience difficulties due to traumatic exposure. Primary mental health outcomes include decreased anxiety, hostility, and depression, and increased pro-social attitudes, as measured by the Oxford Refugee Studies Psychosocial Adjustment Scale and the African Youth Psychosocial Assessment. During this study YRI will be delivered by trained counselors,, Income generating activity programming will be carried out by GOAL and their partner St. George's Foundation through use of their current grant funding. GOAL focuses on supporting people in need by providing healthcare resources, advocating and advancing child protection practices and policies, and administering livelihood programs to empower them improve their lives in a sustainable manner. The St. George's Foundation's addresses child welfare concerns by actively reaching out to homeless and orphaned children. Their already existing employment program is 4 months in length and consists of skills training, soft skills development (primarily in numeracy and literacy), and a cash transfer of $200. The employment intervention is carried out by social workers and counselors, who have been trained to support delivery of the intervention.

N2  - Objectives: Determine if a brief intervention (BI) reduces the negative consequences of drug use/misuse among adult emergency department (ED) patients, and identify patients more likely to benefit from the BI. Methods: This randomized, controlled trial enrolled 1026 18-64 year-old ED patients whose drug misuse indicated a needed for a BI. Differences in total Inventory of Drug Use Consequences (InDUC) scores between the treatment (BI) and control arms (no BI) were assessed every 90 days over a one-year period. Regression models were constructed to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with greater reductions in total InDUC scores. Results: Although total InDUC scores decreased for both the treatment and control arms, there were no differences in scores between the treatment and the control arms at baseline at each follow-up. In the regression analyses, participants who were not using drugs or received drug treatment in the past 90 days generally had lower InDUC scores at each follow-up. Conclusions: Although negative consequences decreased in both study arms over time, receiving a BI did not lead to a greater reduction in the negative consequences of drug misuse than not receiving a BI. Of importance in the design of future ED drug misuse interventions, participants who were successful in stopping their drug misuse or receiving drug treatment did show fewer negative consequences of drug use/misuse.

N2  - The Digital Initiative for Youth (DIY) is an innovative, youth-centered, digital intervention that aims to improve the health and well-being of adolescents ages 13-19 in Fresno County, California. In particular, it will address the needs of homeless and unstably housed youth, youth of color, sexual minority youth, and Native American youth using a trauma-informed approach and positive youth development framework., DIY combines existing, in-person, group-based, comprehensive sexual health education with an app designed in consultation with youth. DIY is built on three strategies: positive youth development, youth-centered design, and wraparound technologies. It will focus on four main areas: sexual health and contraceptive use, healthy relationships, educational and career development, and life skills. The intervention includes six hours of in-person education and an app that includes a resource locator, goal setting, text message reminders, and additional information and referrals., This study is funded through the Personal Responsibility Education Program Innovative Strategies (PREIS), which is administered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau, part of Health and Human Services,, Fresno EOC is responsible for site and participant recruitment as well as the implementation of the intervention. Participants are randomized at the cohort (group) level. All control group participants will be invited to participate after completion of the long-term follow up period.

N2  - Introduction: it has been close to four years since the authors highlighted the total neglect of the oral health of street children in the Journal of Public Health Policy. Since then, the authorities appear to have simply turned the blind eye making this follow-up imperative. This follow-up report specifically examines the resultant oral health disparity between Nigeria's street children and Private, fee-paying secondary school students in Northern Nigeria. Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional comparative survey of randomly selected 12-14 years old street children (children of Quranic informal educational institutions) in Northern Nigeria while fee paying, private secondary school children served as controls. A simple close-ended questionnaire translated into Hausa language was used to assess oral health knowledge and the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index used to categorize oral hygiene status of the participants. Results: the mean age (SD) of the participating street children was 12.7 (0.86) while that of the private secondary school students (PSSS) was 13.05 (0.96). The majority (89%) of parents of street children compared with that (7%) of parents of students of private secondary schools had no western education. Only 6% of street children compared with 90% of PSSS cleaned their teeth for the right reasons. Only 5% of street children compared with 90% of private secondary school students used a fluoride-containing toothpaste. Though both groups of children have poor knowledge (street children 3%, private secondary school students 16%) on the use of dental floss, the mean oral hygiene score (SD) for street children was 4.42 (0.85) compared with 1.90 (0.09) for private secondary school students. There were striking differences in knowledge and practice with only 4% of street children compared with 69% of PSSS with knowledge about fluoride and its use (p < 0.0005). Also, 2% of street children compared with 40% of PSSS were aware of the benefits of regular dental visits. Sixty five (65%) of street children used finger and water only for tooth cleaning, none of the secondary school students practiced this (p = 0.0005). Conclusion: there is disparity in oral health practice between Nigeria's street children and private secondary school children. This disparity may be attributed to lack of western education and socio-economic status.

T1  - An Intervention to Promote Healthy Behaviors in Homeless Youth
Y1  - 2015//
Y2  - 2015//
N2  - The specific aims of this proposal are to:, 1. determine the effectiveness of a self-reflective preventive intervention to promote      responsible substance use and safe sex behaviors (prevent HIV/AIDS) in homeless youths,      ages18-23 years;, 2. determine whether psychological capital factors mediate the relationship between      background risk factors (sexual orientation, duration of homelessness, sex abuse      history, history of substance use, past sexual risk behaviors, and service utilization)      and improved proximal outcomes (self-efficacy and intentions) and distal outcomes      (responsible substance use, safer sex, life satisfaction);, 3. determine the effect of pre-testing on intervention proximal outcomes (immediately      following intervention) and distal outcomes (at an interval of 3 and 6 months following      intervention); and an exploratory aim, 4. to explore general and specific differences in proximal and distal outcomes of the      intervention between participants in two geographically different sites (Austin, TX and      Columbus, OH). We will recruit a total of 600 homeless youths from 2 drop-in centers in      2 geographic areas of the central US: Austin, TX and Columbus, OH. Using a Solomon      four-group design with repeated measures, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial      of a brief possible selves intervention (PSI) consisting of 6 brief individualized      sessions that focus on generating images of one's possible self as feared or as best.      Intervention participants will also receive weekly electronic messages to encourage them      to move toward a goal of becoming their best possible self. Quantitative data will be      collected before, immediately after the intervention, and at intervals of 3 and 6 months      following intervention to test hypotheses about the effectiveness of the intervention on      health behaviors and life satisfaction as well as the effects of pre-testing on these      outcomes using structural equation modeling and ANCOVA statistics. The findings are      expected to have a public health impact on further development of individualized      services to promote healthy behaviors, healthy lifestyles and life satisfaction for      vulnerable youths.

T1  - Suicide Prevention Among Substance Abusing Homeless Youth
Y1  - 2015//
Y2  - 2015//
N2  - While research on homeless youth is increasing, there is a dearth of information regarding effective interventions for these youth. This is of significant concern because studies indicate that 70-95% report problem alcohol or drug use and 66% to 89% of homeless youth have a mental health disorder. Suicide is the leading cause of death with up to 68% of youth reporting a lifetime suicide attempt. Among those who have attempted, an average of 6.2 attempts is reported. In addition, lifetime suicide ideation rates have ranged from 14% to 66.5%. Some predictors of suicide among homeless youth have been identified. These include substance use, childhood physical and sexual abuse, victimization experiences while living on the streets, and psychological functioning, including depression, hopelessness, distress tolerance, impulse control, social support, and problem solving. This study uses general cognitive theory, complemented with concepts from two suicide specific theoretical models, to guide our intervention and conceptual change model. Consonant with the pilot R34 announcement, this study's goal is to pilot test an intervention that has previously demonstrated feasibility and promise with adolescent suicide attempters and efficacy with a low-income sample of adults, "The Cognitive Therapy Intervention for Suicide Attempters." One-hundred fifty homeless youth with recent severe suicide ideation will be randomly assigned to the experimental cognitive therapy for suicide prevention (CTSP) + services as usual (SAU) (n=75) or to SAU alone (n=75). SAU includes those services normally offered through a local drop-in center. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 3, 6, and 9-months post-baseline. It is hypothesized that youth receiving CTSP+SAU will show greater reductions in suicide ideation (primary outcome), substance use and depressive symptoms (secondary outcomes) over time compared to SAU alone. Furthermore, theoretically-derived mediators will be tested to shed light on mechanisms associated with change. The data from this study will be used to determine the initial efficacy of this promising intervention, and determine whether findings warrant a broader scale effectiveness trial. Ultimately, attention towards reducing suicide risk among these youth has the potential to reduce premature mortality, hospitalization and loss of human capital in a very high risk population of youth.

T1  - Evaluation of EBT With Young, Substance Abusing Homeless Mothers
Y1  - 2015//
Y2  - 2015//
N2  - Homeless mothers with young children in their care contend with high rates of substance use, HIV risk, physical and mental health problems and parenting stress. These struggles are in addition to homelessness and meeting the basic needs of themselves and their children. However, a very limited number of studies have examined mother and child outcomes associated with housing and supportive services. Even with increased focus on those experiencing homelessness, the number of homeless families continues to rise, with the demand for temporary shelter so high that many cities are unable to meet the needs of these families. A comprehensive intervention that can be offered outside the shelter setting may offer greater reach to those experiencing homelessness who do not make it in to the shelter system, and for those communities that do not have shelters available. Among the young homeless, those under age 25, research documents that the majority (70%) have never used shelter services. Research attention towards identifying efficacious interventions for this population which address the multiple needs of these families is thus considered an important focus. The proposed intervention (Ecologically-Based Treatment, EBT) includes housing and supportive services and utilizes an ecological systems approach as the theoretical base. It was rigorously developed in a Stage 1 treatment development study with substance use disordered homeless mothers who were engaged through a crisis shelter. EBT showed several outcomes superior to shelter services and is therefore considered a good fit for a population who avoids the shelter but is in great need of housing and support services. Two hundred forty (N = 240) substance use disordered homeless young women between the ages of 18 to 24 years with a biological child under the age of 6 years in their care will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions:, 1. housing and support services (EBT) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) (N = 80),, 2. housing only (HO) + TAU (N = 80), or, 3. TAU only (N=80)., EBT includes 6 months of supportive services (case management, HIV prevention and the Community Reinforcement Approach) in addition to 3 months of rental assistance. HO includes 3 months of rental assistance, but without supportive services. TAU is usual services offered by a homeless youth drop-in center. Participants will be re-assessed at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-baseline. Theoretically derived mediators of change as well as a formal economic evaluation will offer important policy implications. Since homeless substance use disordered mothers and their children are at increased risk for a variety of adverse outcomes, the intervention may produce substantial health-care benefits to their families and society at large.

N2  - Objective: Foreign-origin street children are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS mainly due to poverty, violence, early sexual activity and poor access to health care services. This study aimed to highlight the effectiveness of peer education intervention to reduce HIV-risky behavior among street children with Afghan nationality. Methods: Sixty-one street children were stratified by sex and then randomly allocated to either an intervention or control group by assigning each participant computerized random numbers. The intervention provided peer education services, focused on mode of disease transmission, prevention approaches and awareness of HIV/AIDS services by peers. Results: At least 80% of participants in the intervention and control groups completed the study period, respectively. At the end of the study, statistically significant increase of knowledge and attitude improvement as well as a decreased tendency to do risky sexual intercourse among the intervention subjects was shown. Moreover, there was a time intervention interaction for knowledge and attitude improvements followed by intervention (interaction p value = 0.001), while it was not significant for risky sexual behavior (interaction p value = 0.44). Conclusion: Peer education was an effective and easy-to-apply educational method that increased knowledge and improved attitudes about HIV/AIDS among foreign-origin street children, while it was less efficient with regard to long-term reduction in risky sexual behavior.

N2  - BACKGROUND: While opiate substitution therapy and injecting equipment provision (IEP) have reduced blood-borne viruses (BBV) among people who inject drugs (PWID), some PWID continue to share injecting equipment and acquire BBV. Psychosocial interventions that address risk behaviours could reduce BBV transmission among PWID., METHODS: A pragmatic, two-armed randomised controlled, open feasibility study of PWID attending drug treatment or IEP in four UK regions. Ninety-nine PWID were randomly allocated to receive a three-session manualised psychosocial group intervention and BBV transmission information booklet plus treatment as usual (TAU) (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;52) or information booklet plus TAU (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;47). The intervention was developed from evidence-based literature, qualitative interviews with PWID, key stakeholder consultations, and expert opinion. Recruitment rates, retention in treatment, follow-up completion rates and health economic data completion measured feasibility., RESULTS: Fifty-six percent (99/176) of eligible PWID were recruited. More participants attended at least one intervention session in London (10/16; 63%) and North Wales (7/13; 54%) than in Glasgow (3/12; 25%) and York (0/11). Participants who attended no sessions (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;32) compared to those attending at least one (n&thinsp;=&thinsp;20) session were more likely to be homeless (56 vs 25%, p&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.044), injected drugs for a greater number of days (median 25 vs 6.5, p&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.019) and used a greater number of needles from an IEP in the last month (median 31 vs 20, p&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.056). No adverse events were reported. 45.5% (45/99) were followed up 1 month post-intervention. Feedback forms confirmed that the intervention was acceptable to both intervention facilitators and participants who attended it. Follow-up attendance was associated with fewer days of injecting in the last month (median 14 vs 27, p&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.030) and fewer injections of cocaine (13 vs 30%, p&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.063). Analysis of the questionnaires identified several service use questionnaire categories that could be excluded from the assessment battery in a full-randomised controlled trial., CONCLUSIONS: Findings should be interpreted with caution due to small sample sizes. A future definitive RCT of the psychosocial intervention is not feasible. The complex needs of some PWID may have limited their engagement in the intervention. More flexible delivery methods may have greater reach., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN66453696.

N2  - Background: Public health considerations require that clinical trials address the complex "real-world" needs of patients with chronic illnesses. This is particularly true for persons with schizophrenia, whose management is frequently complicated by factors such as comorbid substance abuse, homelessness, and contact with the criminal justice system. In addition, barriers to obtaining health care in the United States often prevent successful community reentry and optimal patient management. Further, nonadherence to treatment is common, and this reinforces cycles of relapse and recidivism. Long-acting injectable antipsychotic therapy may facilitate continuity of treatment and support better outcomes, particularly in patients who face these challenges. Clinical trials with classical explanatory designs may not be the best approaches for evaluating these considerations. We describe the design and rationale of a novel trial that combines both explanatory and pragmatic design features and studies persons with schizophrenia who face these challenges. Design and Rationale: The Paliperidone Palmitate Research in Demonstrating Effectiveness (PRIDE) study is a prospective, open-label, randomized, 15-month study conducted between May 5, 2010, and December 9, 2013, comparing long-acting injectable paliperidone palmitate and oral antipsychotic medications in subjects with schizophrenia (according to DSM-IV criteria). Investigators and subjects had broad flexibility for treatment decision-making, thus making it a model that better reflects real-world practice. The primary end point was time to treatment failure, defined as arrest/incarceration psychiatric hospitalization; suicide; treatment discontinuation or supplementation due to inadequate efficacy, safety, or tolerability; or increased psychiatric services to prevent hospitalization. This end point was adjudicated by a blinded event monitoring board. Patients were followed to the 15-month end point, regardless of whether they were maintained on their initial randomized treatment. This article provides some of the reasoning behind the authors' choices when combining features from both explanatory and pragmatic approaches to this trial's design. Conclusions: The PRIDE study incorporates real-world design features in a novel, prospective, comparative study of long-acting injectable and oral antipsychotics in persons with schizophrenia who have had recent contact with the criminal justice system. Insights provided should help the reader to better understand the need for more real-world approaches for clinical studies and how a broader approach can better aid clinical treatment and public health decision-making.

N2  - Youth who leave home for the streets are at significantly more risk for a multitude of problems, yet little research is available to guide treatment intervention efforts with this population. Studies document high rates of substance use, HIV risk, mental health problems, teenage pregnancy and criminality. Research to date examining homeless, street living youth has been primarily descriptive; less effort has been directed towards developing and evaluating treatment interventions for this group. The majority of homeless youth do not receive substance abuse treatment, with one study reporting that only 15% of street living youth report ever receiving mental health services. The effectiveness of the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) with street living youth was studied in our recently completed Stage 1 trial. The proposed study is a Stage II clinical trial examining outcome of CRA individual therapy as compared to two interventions commonly employed, yet little researched, with this group. All clients will be randomized to one of three theoretically distinct interventions: (1) CRA therapy, (2) Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), or (3) Case Management (CM). The relative effectiveness of these interventions will be evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months post-baseline. The Social Ecology Theory of Development (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) guides our change hypotheses and intervention. Proposed change mechanisms (mediators) for each intervention will be evaluated. Differential treatment response as a function of ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation and abuse (moderators) will be investigated to better understand the interventions. The study will also examine how, if at all, treatment engagement, retention and expectations impact youth response to the three treatments. Information gained through this project may help address the gap in our understanding of how best to effectively intervene with a group at high risk for continuing health and psychological problems.

T1  - Effect of a Rent Subsidy and Mentoring on Youth Transitioning Out of Homelessness
T2  - Transitioning Youth Out of Homelessness: a Mixed Methods Community-Based Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of a Rent Subsidy and Mentoring Intervention in Three Canadian Cities
Y1  - 2018//
Y2  - 2018//
N2  - The overarching aim of this mixed methods study is to assess whether and how rent subsidies and mentorship influence social integration outcomes for formerly homeless young people living in market rent housing in three urban settings., Specifically, the objectives of this study are to:, 1. Determine whether rent subsidies plus mentorship results in better social integration      outcomes than only receiving rent subsidies with respect to: a) community integration      (psychological and physical); and b) self-esteem at the primary endpoint of 18 months., 2. Determine whether rent subsidies plus mentorship results in better social integration      outcomes than only receiving rent subsidies with respect to: a) social connectedness; b)      hope; and c) sustained academic and vocational participation at 18 months., 3. Explore whether rent subsidies plus mentorship results in better social integration      outcomes than only receiving rent subsidies with respect to: a) income; b) perceived      housing quality; c) psychiatric symptoms; and d) sense of engulfment at 18 months., 4. Integrate qualitative data to facilitate a fuller understanding of the quantitative data      and deepen understanding of what the study participants (young people and mentors) found      most beneficial about the intervention and how it could be improved., This study will employ a convergent mixed methods design (i.e., quantitative and qualitative data are collected concurrently, and the findings combined) embedded within a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and a community-based participatory action research (CBPAR) framework. A mixed methods RCT is appropriate given the complex explanatory pathways (i.e., social and behavioral processes that may act independently and interdependently) of this intervention. In addition, the qualitative data will provide insights on contextual factors that may impact the external validity of the findings. Most importantly, this design provides a crucial (and under utilized) youth-informed perspective on social integration., The study will be conducted in three Canadian cities: Toronto, Ontario (pop. 2.8 million); Hamilton, Ontario (pop. 552,000); and St. Catharines, Ontario (pop. 133,000). All of the study participants (n = 24) will receive rent subsidies (ranging from $400 - $500/month) for 24 months as a part of the intervention. This study includes funding for the rent subsidies and will be paid directly to the landlords by the community partners. St. Michael's Hospital will establish a service provider agreement with each of the community partners for this purpose. Participants in the intervention group (n = 12) will be matched with an adult mentor recruited by one of the community partners., In keeping with CBPAR methodology, disseminating evidence with community partners is key in building community capacity and improving the lives of the young people participating in this study. Moreover, given the use of Critical Social Theory, the study findings will not only be presented, but will also be used to expose and explicate the relational processes (e.g., subjective experience of low socioeconomic position and low social class) that may be preventing formerly homeless young people from achieving meaningful social integration. With an emphasis on 'actionable' data, the findings will be disseminated broadly to both academic and community-based audiences in a variety of formats ranging from scientific journal papers to oral presentations., The mentors will be encouraged to incorporate the key relationship-based components of natural mentors (e.g., a 'coach' or 'cheerleader' role) to assist with mainstream integration. To facilitate more of an organic, natural mentor-mentee relationship, the mentors will have more flexibility than a typical formal mentorship program in the types of activities they pursue with their mentees. For example, they will not be mandated to attend shelter-based social events. Instead, mentors will be encouraged to initiate activities that direct their mentees away from the shelter system (and their old identities as homeless youth) and toward the mainstream (e.g., meeting for coffee at a local university campus, touring a local library, or visiting the mentor's place of employment during business hours). All of the mentors will meet monthly with their mentees for two years. In addition, the mentor will be encouraged to touch base with their mentee via phone or text message every week. If a mentor is unable to continue their role and there are at least six months left in the study, the study participant will be matched with a new mentor., Community partners will match all participants with an outreach worker (already employed by each agency) who will communicate regularly with the research team, help ensure the rent subsidies are being distributed appropriately, maintain an ongoing relationship with the study participants, and monitor for 'red flags' in participants matched in mentor-mentee relationships (e.g., mentee reluctant to meet with their mentor). Matching all of the study participants with a worker will also help ensure that everyone is receiving a fairly equal level of social support from community partners, making it easier for the research team to discern whether the outcomes of interest are more likely attributable to mentorship rather than to varied levels of agency-based support. Moreover, a review of services and interventions designed to reduce "problem behaviors" (e.g., substance use and risky sexual practices) among street-involved and homeless young people (ages 12 - 24) found that researchers who had strong relationships with outreach workers and the community had more effective interventions and lower attrition rates than those who did not., Following the baseline interview, participants at each of the three study sites (Toronto (n=12), Hamilton (n=6), and St. Catharine's (n=6)) will be randomized using block randomization to either the intervention (rent subsidies plus mentoring) or control (rent subsidies only) group. Randomization will be balanced by site based on random block sizes of two and four. The advantage of using block randomization is to uniformly distribute participants into treatment groups within each site. Because small block sizes may increase the risk of guessing the allocation procedure and subsequently introducing bias into the enrolment procedure, random block sizes will be used to avoid this potential selection bias. A unique randomization schedule will be produced for each site using SAS. A research coordinator not affiliated with the study will be the only person with access to the randomization schedule. The research coordinator will prepare sealed, opaque and sequentially numbered envelopes with the randomization results of participants. After assessing for eligibility and obtaining consent of each participant, research personnel responsible for enrolling participants will open the next randomization envelope from the sequentially ordered randomization envelope file to obtain the participant's randomized group assignment., Quantitative data will be collected at six points in time over the course of 30 months: baseline, month six, month 12, month 18, month 24, and month 30. Qualitative measures are an important feature of this study and will consist of: 1) semi-structured individual interviews (study participants) and 2) focus groups (mentors). At baseline, twelve participants (six from each arm of the study) will be invited to participate in six semi-structured individual interviews, which will take place at the same time as the quantitative data collection: baseline, month six, month 12, month 18, month 24, and month 30. Participants will be purposively selected with a goal of having input from each of the three communities and a fairly equal gender and ethno-racial representation. All of the mentors (n = 12) will be invited to participate in two focus groups, which will take place at month 12 and month 24., All analyses will be performed using the intention-to-treat principle; that is, all participants will be included and analyzed in the groups they were originally randomized. Baseline characteristics of the intervention and control groups will be summarized using descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, standard deviation, median and interquartile range for continuous variables, and frequencies and proportions for categorical variables). The descriptive statistics for outcomes at each study time point will be calculated, and differences in trajectories from baseline to 30 months follow-up between intervention and control groups using scatterplots and box-plots will be explored. Differences with 95% confidence intervals in continuous outcomes at 18 months (psychological community integration, self-esteem, social connectedness, hope, perceived housing quality, psychiatric symptoms, and sense of engulfment) between participants who received rent subsidies plus mentorship and participants who only received rent subsidies will be estimated using Analysis of Covariance (i.e., linear regression models), including an indicator of intervention group and the baseline value of the outcome. Regression diagnostics will be performed and analyses using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be repeated if there are extreme outliers or influential observations. Groups will be compared with respect to count outcomes at 18 months (physical community integration) using graphical tools and the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. For binary outcomes at 18 months (sustained academic and vocational participation, and income above low income cut-off ), differences in proportions with 95% confidence intervals will be estimated and tested using the chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Given the small sample size of this pilot randomized trial, all results will be interpreted with caution and with the intention of generating data and hypotheses for conducting a larger trial., Given the emergent, iterative nature of research using a qualitative design, data analysis and interpretation will begin immediately after the first qualitative data generation session (at baseline). The semi-structured individual interviews and focus groups will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. In order to conduct a more nuanced analysis of the data, the transcriptionist will be instructed to note short responses, uncooperative tones, and literal silence. Prior to each subsequent qualitative data generation session, members of the research team will conduct a preliminary data analysis, reading the interview transcripts multiple times, separating the data into coded segments, making analytic memos beside sections of the transcripts, identifying emerging themes (and comparing/contrasting these between respondents), and compiling new questions. Those participating in the individual interviews and the focus groups will be asked for their perspectives on the emerging interpretations at each visit and these perspectives will play a key role in helping shape the data analysis and help ensure the trustworthiness of the data. The web-based application Dedoose will be utilized to assist with sorting and coding the qualitative data.

N2  - There is a dearth of research that examines the impact of family systems therapy on problems among sexually and/or physically abused youth. Given this void, differential outcome and predictors of substance use change were evaluated for abused, as compared with nonabused, runaway adolescents who were randomly assigned to family therapy or treatment as usual. Abused adolescents reported lower family cohesion at baseline, although both abused and nonabused adolescents showed similar substance use reductions. Utilizing hierarchical linear modeling, we found that substance use changed with change in cohesion over time. These findings link change in family functioning to change in adolescent substance use, supporting fiamily systems theory. Findings suggest that a potent target of intervention involves focus on increasing positive communication interactions.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of 3 theoretically distinct interventions among substance-abusing runaway adolescents and to explore individual differences in trajectories of change., METHOD: Adolescents (N = 179) between the ages of 12 and 17 were recruited from a runaway shelter in a midwestern city. The sample included 94 females (52.5%) and 85 males (47.5%); the majority of the adolescents were African American (n = 118, 65.9%). Adolescents were randomly assigned to the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA, n = 57), Motivational Interviewing (MI, n = 61), or Ecologically-Based Family Therapy (EBFT, n = 61). Substance use was assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months via Form 90 and urine screens., RESULTS: Hierarchical linear modeling revealed statistically significant improvement in frequency of substance use among runaways in all 3 treatment groups, with a slight increase at posttreatment. Latent trajectory profile analysis explored individual differences in change trajectories and yielded a 3-class model. The majority of adolescents (n = 136, 76%) showed reductions in substance use over time, with a slight increase at follow-up (Class 1: Decreasing). Twenty-four (13.4%) adolescents had shown high levels of substance use over time with patterns of increase and decrease (Class 2: Fluctuating high users), and 19 (10.6%) decreased but returned to baseline levels by 2 years postbaseline (Class 3: U shaped). Few differences among treatment conditions were noted; within the "decreasing" group, adolescents in MI treatment showed a quicker decline in their substance use but a faster relapse compared with those receiving EBFT., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CRA, EBFT, and MI are viable treatments for runaway substance-abusing adolescents.

N2  - This study completed an extensive formative phase to adapt the Women's CoOp intervention to specifically address the needs of young out-of-school adolescent African-American females with regard to knowledge about sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV and sexuality, health consequences of substance abuse, relationships with males, condom communication and social support, and HIV risk-reduction and violence prevention methods. During this phase, in-depth interviews, focus groups, pretesting and pilot testing were conducted to adapt and refine the intervention for the clinical trial., The aim of this trial is to:, &bull; Evaluate the efficacy of the cultural-, age-, and gender-focused intervention (Young Women's CoOp) relative to an equal attention control nutrition intervention in terms of changes in behaviors (e.g., condom use, substance use, violence prevention)., At study enrollment/baseline, participants completed a questionnaire and baseline drug and pregnancy testing, and were randomized into one of two programs: Young Women's CoOp or Staying Healthy and Eating Well (Nutrition)&mdash;both which included 3 individual intervention sessions and 1 group activity. Follow-ups were conducted 3-months post-intervention and 6-months post-intervention and included a questionnaire and drug testing., The study has since been completed and analysis and manuscript preparation is underway. Two abstracts have been accepted to American Public Health Association conferences in 2012 and 2013. The five papers in progress or published include:, 1.

N2  - Background: The TIP (Traumatic Injury Prevention) Project evaluated the impact on post-injury drug use of two brief motivational interventions compared to brief advice (BA) among injured patients who use drugs. Method: Three-group, single blind, randomized controlled trial in a Level 1Trauma Center enrolled 395 admitted patients with drug positive toxicology screen or verbal report of drug use in the previous 30 days. 34% were Hispanic, 45% non-Hispanic White, 16% non-Hispanic Black. 88% smoked marijuana, 28% used cocaine and 11% prescription opioids. Brief Advice (BA) provided advice to abstain from drugs, educational materials and referral to community resources. Brief Motivational Intervention (BMI) additionally included a 30-45 minute session, with assessment feedback, based on motivational interviewing. BMI + B included a telephone booster 4-weeks post-intervention. Drug use as measured by percent days abstinent and total abstinence, derived from the Timeline Follow back was the primary outcome. Results: A significant reduction from baseline was observed at 3, 6, and 12 months in the primary outcomes of any drug use (excluding alcohol); cannabis and cocaine, the most frequently used drugs, were analyzed individually. There were no between group differences or group X time interactions. Similarly, there were no between groups differences on secondary outcomes including perceived health status, re-injury, arrest, incarceration, alcohol and drug treatment, employment, AA attendance, homelessness, physical abuse, and problems associated with alcohol and drug use. Conclusions: The study does not support use of these enhanced motivational interventions over brief advice for trauma patients with a positive screen for drug use.

N2  - Given high levels of health and psychological costs associated with the family disruption of homelessness, identifying predictors of runaway and homeless episodes is an important goal. The current study followed 179 substance abusing, shelter-recruited adolescents who participated in a randomized clinical trial. Predictors of runaway and homeless episodes were examined over a two year period. Results from the hierarchical linear modeling analysis showed that family cohesion and substance use, but not family conflict or depressive symptoms, delinquency, or school enrollment predicted future runaway and homeless episodes. Findings suggest that increasing family support, care and connection and reducing substance use are important targets of intervention efforts in preventing future runaway and homeless episodes amongst a high risk sample of adolescents.

T1  - Study the Impact of the CommunityRx Program on Health, Self-care and Cost
T2  - Evaluating CommunityRx, a Self-Care Innovation for Older Adults, Using Agent-Based Modeling: collecting and Analyzing Data to Build the Agent Based Model
Y1  - 2015//

N2  - CommunityRx connects health care to self-care. CommunityRx begins with the medical encounter and functions like an e-prescribing system, modeled after medication e-prescribing.9 Rather than sending a medication prescription to the patient's pharmacy, a HealtheRx "prescription" is automatically generated at the point of care, delivered to the patient in paper (or electronic) form and stored in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) for future reference. The HealtheRx is ontologically-generated, driven by standard demographic (eg. age, gender, address, language) data fields in the EMR and customized to patient problems/diagnoses like "homelessness," or "obesity." Like e-prescribing medicine, CommunityRx involves prescribing, fulfillment (patient signs up for a Weight Watchers class), and administration (patient participates in the weight loss program) (Fig. 2).10 The HealtheRx prescription is the primary information agent in the system, driven by simple ontologic rules that generate complexity, including iteration of the CommunityRx system itself, as human agents interact with the self-care information., CommunityRx can be best understood as part of a complex adaptive system. The HealtheRx, in contrast to a drug prescription, is designed specifically to enhance the interpersonal aspect of the patient-physician encounter, informing both agents about self-care resources. A patient receives a HealtheRx and then contacts a Community Health Information Specialist (CHIS) or not. She seeks self-care resources or not., Data captured by the CommunityRx system about patient referrals and needs are distributed to community-based service providers (CBSPs) in the form of quarterly reports delivered to CBSP contacts cultivated by CHIS. These data efficiently reveal to CBSPs real-time needs and gaps in self-care resources. The investigators hypothesize these data will be used by CBSPs over time to ensure supply. Youth who generate community resource data through employment with MAPSCorps also gain insight to community resources and engage with CBSP personnel and CHIS as they gather their data. Youth spread information to their networks about community resources and increase their use of these resources. MAPSCorps data about community resources are shared publicly (www.healtherx.org, www.southsidehealth.org, www.dondeesta.org). Self-care becomes more efficient. Supply meets demand. Patients and providers have more time and resources to devote to other salubrious activities and CBSPs become stronger. Over time, transparency in the market for self-care resources increases competition and quality., A. Purpose or Hypothesis, Specifically, the aims (and associated hypotheses) of this research include:, Aim 1. Evaluate the impact of CommunityRx on health care utilization, cost, health, and patient-centered outcomes for program participants (patients who receive care at the clinical demonstration sites and live in an 16 zip code area) compared to controls (patients who receive health care at the demonstration sites, but live outside the 16 zip code area), with a special focus on middle-age and older adults., Aim 1a. Evaluate the impact of CommunityRx on health care utilization, health care costs, and on health outcomes for program participants (patients who receive care at the clinical demonstration sites and live in an 16 zip code area) compared to controls (patients who receive health care at the demonstration sites, but live outside the 11 zip code area) of all ages. NOTE: This aim is funded separately and registered on clinicaltrials.gov separately (see ID 1C1CMS330997)., Hypothesis: CommunityRx will decrease emergency/inpatient care utilization, decrease percent per beneficiary per year (%PBPY) costs and improve health., Aim 1b. Evaluate the impact of the CommunityRx system on patient-centered outcomes in a randomized control trail of 200 program participants ages 45-74 and compared to 200 controls., This hypothetical dynamic is an example of emergent self-organization from a complex adaptive system. The intervention starts with a simple encounter, governed by simple rules, between patient and health care provider. As the number of these encounters grow, previously siloed sectors - health care and self-care - evolve a new kind of formation that is far more efficient for the community than the current state. CommunityRx drives this new formation through multiple agents who are unaware of the complexity they are producing: "&hellip;the self-organized structure simply emerges as a result of each individual doing their own thing, independently." In evaluating the economic effects of CommunityRx adoption, agent-based modeling (ABM) can test how close the attractor state, or end-point in a CommunityRx system configuration (set of assumed behaviors and designed interventions), comes to a Pareto efficient point of equilibrium. The effects of the CommunityRx intervention are non-linear, involve interactions and feedback loops, and therefore require a complex system modeling approach for evaluation., Data inputs for agent based modeling (ABM) can come from a range of sources, including empirical quantitative and qualitative data, data from the literature, and expert opinion. Because CommunityRx targets people of all ages (0-99 yrs, to date), a prospective, experimental, community-based design (eg. RCT) to assess outcomes by age strata would be very informative about patient agents (the investigators expect age-group differences in behavior, social networks, and outcomes) but cost-prohibitive. ABM can accommodate assumptions made based on this important, but specific, population subgroup (or "testbed"), includes many agents, and allows for multiple simulations to assess the impact of variations in those assumptions for the much larger and more diverse population that the system-wide model includes. A cost-effectiveness analysis is needed to understand the true economic impact of CommunityRx on the total cost of the burden of disease. In addition, the research team brings clinical and research expertise and specialized interest in middle-age and older adult populations with chronic disease. Focusing on this subgroup builds on this track record and will meaningfully extend our contributions to the gerontology and geriatrics fields., Hypothesis: CommunityRx will be associated with clinically meaningful improvements in: a) self-care behavior; b) perceived care quality; and c) quality of life., Aim 1c. Characterize the economic value of care augmented with the CommunityRx system compared to usual care, based on the prospective participant-control study described in Aim 1b., Hypothesis: Compared to usual care, care augmented with the CommunityRx system will be as cost-effective as commonly accepted medical devices and treatments., Aim 2. Examine the flow and spread of information to and through primary agents including: program participants, community health information specialists, healthcare providers, and community-based service providers (businesses and organizations providing self-care resources)., Hypotheses: 1) Among the CBSPs receiving high volumes of CommunityRx referrals for people &ge;45 years old (>1000/year), CommunityRx will produce a self-reported increase in: a) knowledge of community resources especially for older adults, b) referrals to other CBSPs, c) older client volume, and d) aging-related goods/services /programs inventory; and 2) Delivery of the CommunityRx intervention at the point of medical care produces knowledge about self-care resources in the community that spreads to secondary agents including members of patient and provider social networks., Aim 3. Build and use an agent-based model to test the distributed impact, including economic effects, of CommunityRx adoption on the demonstration area and predict performance over time by conducting experiments that vary assumptions about agent, environment, and population-level characteristics., Hypotheses: 1) The system-level value of CommunityRx is greater than the value quantified as %PBPY health care utilization savings and is projected to increase with population aging; 2) Experiments run on a systems-based model will predict and quantify the impact of strategies to optimize CommunityRx performance for improvements, sustainability, and spread to other settings; and 3) Systems-Based Modeling is an effective and efficient tool for large-scale evaluation of a health information technology-based intervention to improve health and health care.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The current study sought to test hard drug use outcomes for youth receiving a strengths-based outreach and advocacy intervention that linked youth to either a shelter or a drop-in center. METHODS: Homeless youth (14-24 years old) were engaged by research assistants (RAs) at soup kitchens, parks, libraries, and other locations that homeless youth were known to frequent. Youth were randomly assigned to receive six months of advocacy that focused on linking youth to a drop-in center (n = 40) or to a crisis shelter (n = 39). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Hard drug use over time was the main outcome. Intervention condition and service connection were used as predictors for the baseline level and the slope of change in hard drug use over time. Data analysis was conducted with Bernoulli Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling in HLM7. RESULTS: The current study found that those who were in the drop-in linkage condition exhibited a greater reduction in their odds of using hard drugs during the follow-up points than their counterparts in the shelter linkage condition. And finally, those who utilized services more often during the follow-ups were those who exhibited less hard drug use at baseline and less reduction in their odds of using hard drugs. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that drop-in centers, which are often characterized by low-demand programming and few behavioral restrictions, are effective for addressing hard drug use among homeless youth.

N2  - Introduction Cigarette smoking is associated with many adverse health effects and is an important public health concern. Increased understanding of smokers' behavior is central to developing effective interventions. Cigarette scavenging, a behavior that involves smoking shared or previously used cigarettes has thus far only been shown to be prevalent among homeless or incarcerated populations. The current study examines whether cigarette scavenging is prevalent in a more general population of adult smokers enrolling in a smoking cessation clinical trial, and whether engagement in this behavior is associated with demographic or smoking-related psychosocial factors. Methods Baseline data was obtained from adult smokers (N = 227) enrolling in a randomized clinical trial for smoking cessation. Cigarette scavenging was assessed using three items: a) sharing a cigarette with a stranger; b) smoking a &ldquo;found&rdquo; cigarette and c) smoking a previously used cigarette &ldquo;butt&rdquo;. Participants who endorsed engaging in at least one of these three behaviors were categorized as a scavenger. Results Approximately 32% of participants endorsed at least one cigarette scavenging behavior. A multiple logistic regression analysis found that scavengers were more likely to be: men (p < 0.001), of younger age at smoking onset (p = 0.012), unemployed (p = 0.003), more likely to have used marijuana in the past 30 days (p = 0.005), single or living alone (p = 0.003), and to have experienced higher withdrawal symptoms during previous quit attempts (p = 0.044) as compared to non-scavengers. Conclusions Scavenging is common among adult smokers. Interventions that address cigarette scavenging behaviors may better meet the needs of this unique smoking subgroup.

N2  - Homeless youth frequently experience victimization, and youth with histories of trauma often fail to detect danger risks, making them vulnerable to subsequent victimization. The current study describes a pilot test of a skills-based intervention designed to improve risk detection among homeless youth through focusing attention to internal, interpersonal, and environmental cues. Youth aged 18 to 21 years ( N = 74) were recruited from a shelter and randomly assigned to receive usual case management services or usual services plus a 3-day manualized risk detection intervention. Pretest and posttest interviews assessed youths' risk detection abilities through vignettes describing risky situations and asking youth to identify risk cues present. Separate 2 (intervention vs. control) &times; 2 (pretest vs. posttest) mixed ANOVAs found significant interaction effects, as intervention youth significantly improved in overall risk detection compared with control youth. Post hoc subgroup analyses found the intervention had a greater effect for youth without previous experiences of indirect victimization than those with previous indirect victimization experiences.

N2  - The effects of a resilience enhancement programme on resilience, depression, anxiety, and problem drinking among female runaway youths living in shelters were evaluated. Participants were 32 youths (16 experimental and 16 control participants), assessed at pre-test, post-test, and one-month follow-up. The programme incorporated five protective factors associated with resilience: self-esteem, self-regulation, relational skills, problem-solving skills, and goal-setting skills. There were significant group-by-time interaction effects for resilience, anxiety, and problem drinking at one-month follow-up. The preliminary results suggest that providing female runaway youths with this programme focusing on protective factors may enhance resilience and mitigate anxiety, and problem drinking.

N2  - The study aimed to evaluate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for posttraumatic stress (PTS), depression, anxiety, and anger in street children by a randomized controlled trial of CBT versus a waitlist control. It was conducted in 8 residential facilities for street children in Mexico City, with assessments at baseline, posttreatment, and 3 months later. Children who reported at least moderate posttraumatic stress, and fulfilled the study requirement were enrolled in the study (N = 100, 12-18 years old, 36 boys). There were 51 children randomized to CBT and 49 to the waitlist condition. Randomization was stratified by gender. CBT consisted of 12 individual 1-hour sessions administered weekly by 2 trained, master's-level clinicians. Outcome measures included self-reports of PTS, depression, anxiety, and anger; global improvement was assessed by the independent evaluator. Compared to participants in the waitlist condition participants in CBT showed a significant reduction in all symptoms, with effects sizes of 1.73 to 1.75. At follow up there was attrition (n = 36), and no change from posttreatment scores. The study did find statistically significant improvement in symptoms in the CBT group compared to the waitlist condition; symptoms remained stable at 3 months. The study found that CBT for trauma in a sample of street children provided a reduction of a broad range of mental health symptoms.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol is the leading psychoactive substance consumed in France, with about 15 million regular consumers. The National institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) considers alcohol abuse to be more than 14 units of alcohol a week for men and 7 units for women. The specific complication of alcoholism is the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Its incidence reaches up to 30 % and its main complications are delirium tremens, restlessness, extended hospital stay, higher morbidity, and psychiatric and cognitive impairment. Without appropriate treatment, delirium tremens can lead to death in up to 50 % of patients., METHODS/DESIGN: This prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled study versus placebo will be conducted in twelve French intensive care units (ICU). Patients with an alcohol intake level higher than the NIAAA threshold, who are under mechanical ventilation, will be included. The primary objective is to determine whether baclofen is more efficient than placebo in preventing restlessness-related side effects in the ICU. Secondary outcomes include mechanical ventilation duration, length of ICU stay, and cumulative doses of sedatives and painkillers received within 28 days of ICU admission. Restlessness-related side effects in the ICU are defined as unplanned extubation, medical disposal removal (such as urinary catheter, venous or arterial line or surgical drain), falling out of bed, ICU runaway (leaving ICU without physician's approval), immobilisation device removal, self-aggression or aggression towards medical staff. Daily doses of baclofen/placebo will be guided by daily creatinine clearance assessment., DISCUSSION: Restlessness in alcoholic patients is a life-threatening issue in ICUs. BACLOREA is a randomised study assessing the capacity of baclofen to prevent agitation in mechanically ventilated patients. Enrolment of 314 patients will begin in June 2016 and is expected to end in October 2018., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723383 , registered on 3 March 2016.

N2  - A randomized controlled trial was conducted with homeless gay and bisexual men to assess the impact of two culturally sensitive intervention programs on reduction of drug use and risky sexual behavior. In this study, gay and bisexual men between 18 and 46 years of age were randomly assigned to one of two culturally sensitive behavioral intervention programs: a Nurse Case Management Plus Contingency Management (NCM + CM; n = 204) or a Standard Education Plus Contingency Management (SE + CM; n = 210) program. Regardless of group assignment, significant and clinically relevant reductions were observed in stimulant use over time. Multivariable predictors of stimulant use at 4- and 8-month follow-up evaluations were recent injection drug use, tested positive for HIV, or for use of amphetamine. Data revealed a significant linear decline over time for those who had sex with multiple partners. Furthermore, being HIV positive was associated with reporting multiple partners, while higher homophobia scores and having children were inversely related to reports of having sex with multiple partners at follow-up. Culturally sensitive approaches are needed to successfully reduce drug use and risky sexual activities among gay and bisexual populations.

T1  - An Arts Intervention for Drug-Using Homeless Youth
Y1  - 2009//
Y2  - 2009//
N2  - Nationwide, homeless youths are attempting to escape major life challenges, which may result in problem drug and alcohol use. Such behaviors are associated with hepatitis virus infections and HIV. Less than one third of homeless youth seek medical care, and less than 10% of drug and alcohol-using youths seek substance abuse treatment services. Based upon increasing knowledge about the barriers experienced by homeless youth relating to accessing treatment for substance use and health promoting services, it is clear that homeless youth need to play a major role in the planning, implementation and evaluation of drug counseling programs delivered at sites that homeless youth frequent. Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, UCLA researchers recently engaged homeless youth and community partners in qualitative research to better understand homeless youths' perspectives on drug counseling and to consider innovative strategies to engage homeless youth, in accessing drug use and health promotion counseling. Our community partners included homeless youth from homeless youth-based organizations, and faculty from the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts). An innovative youth-centered strategy considered by homeless youth was the use of the arts and media to craft personal messages that capture youth interest and appeal. In the proposed investigation, researchers, homeless youth and staff from a drop-in site frequented by homeless youth, along with our CalArts partners, will participate in the development, pilot testing and evaluation of a youth-centered drug-use and health-promoting intervention program. In Phase I of this R21, a CBPR approach will be utilized with a steering committee to develop a youth-centered drug use and health promoting intervention program, LIFE MATTERS which will be assessed in terms of acceptability via focus group sessions with street youth and subsequently refined based upon homeless youth feedback. In Phase 2, investigators and community partners will conduct a pilot study to explore the acceptability of the LIFE MATTERS program as well as test the impact of the program, compared to a control group, with 80 similar youth in terms of: completion of the program; reduction of risky drug and alcohol use; completion of a HAV/HBV vaccine series; and improvement in knowledge about hepatitis. The short-term goals are to refine strategies that can be fully tested in a large-scale intervention trial. The long-term goals are to contribute to knowledge about promoting innovative and youth-designed drug-related behaviors, and treatment completion in settings where youth congregate.

N2  - BACKGROUND: As medical homes are developing under health reform, little is known regarding depression services need and use by diverse safety-net populations in under-resourced communities. For chronic conditions like depression, primary care services may face new opportunities to partner with diverse community service providers, such as those in social service and substance abuse centers, to support a collaborative care model of treating depression., OBJECTIVE: To understand the distribution of need and current burden of services for depression in under-resourced, diverse communities in Los Angeles., DESIGN: Baseline phase of a participatory trial to improve depression services with data from client screening and follow-up surveys., PARTICIPANTS: Of 4,440 clients screened from 93 programs (primary care, mental health, substance abuse, homeless, social and other community services) in 50 agencies, 1,322 were depressed according to an eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) and gave contact information; 1,246 enrolled and 981 completed surveys. Ninety-three programs, including 17 primary care/public health, 18 mental health, 20 substance abuse, ten homeless services, and 28 social/other community services, participated., MAIN MEASURES: Comparisons by setting in 6-month retrospective recall of depression services use., KEY RESULTS: Depression prevalence ranged from 51.9 % in mental health to 17.2 % in social-community programs. Depressed clients used two settings on average to receive depression services; 82 % used any setting. More clients preferred counseling over medication for depression treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Need for depression care was high, and a broad range of agencies provide depression care. Although most participants had contact with primary care, most depression services occurred outside of primary care settings, emphasizing the need to coordinate and support the quality of community-based services across diverse community settings.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone and extended-release injection naltrexone are effective treatments, with distinct mechanisms, for opioid use disorder. The authors examined whether patients' demographic and clinical characteristics were associated with better response to one medication or the other. METHODS: In a multisite 24-week randomized comparative-effectiveness trial of assignment to buprenorphine-naloxone (N=287) compared with extended-release naltrexone (N=283) comprising inpatients planning to initiate medication treatment for opioid use disorder, 50 demographic and clinical characteristics were examined as moderators of the effect of medication assignment on relapse to regular opioid use and failure to initiate medication. Moderator-by-medication interactions were estimated using logistic regression with correction for multiple testing. RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat sample, patients who reported being homeless had a lower relapse rate if they were assigned to receive extended-release naltrexone (51.6%) compared with buprenorphine-naloxone (70.4%) (odds ratio=0.45, 95% CI=0.22, 0.90); patients who were not homeless had a higher relapse rate if they were assigned to extended-release naltrexone (70.9%) compared with buprenorphine-naloxone (53.1%) (odds ratio=2.15, 95% CI=1.44, 3.21). In the subsample of patients who initiated medication, the interaction was not significant, with a similar pattern of lower relapse with extended-release naltrexone (41.4%) compared with buprenorphine (68.6%) among homeless patients (odds ratio=0.32, 95% CI=0.15, 0.68) but less difference among those not homeless (extended-release naltrexone, 57.2%; buprenorphine, 52.0%; odds ratio=1.24, 95% CI=0.80, 1.90). For failure to initiate medication, moderators were stated preference for medication (failure was less likely if the patient was assigned to the medication preferred), parole and probation status (fewer failures with extended-release naltrexone for those on parole or probation), and presence of pain and timing of randomization (more failure with extended-release naltrexone for patients endorsing moderate to severe pain and randomized early while still undergoing medically managed withdrawal). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with opioid use disorder admitted to inpatient treatment, homelessness, parole and probation status, medication preference, and factors likely to influence tolerability of medication initiation may be important in matching patients to buprenorphine or extended-release naltrexone.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Although youth homelessness presents a significant public health problem, the needs of homeless youths with mental illness, as distinct from adults, are not well understood. This study examined the unique demographic, clinical, and service use characteristics of homeless youths., METHODS: At Home/Chez Soi was a large randomized controlled trial of the Housing First model in five cities in Canada. Of 2,255 participants, 7% (N=164) were youths ages 18 to 24. Youths were compared with older participants on baseline demographic, clinical, and service use characteristics., RESULTS: More youths than adults had not finished high school (76% versus 54%), had a drug use disorder (66% versus 52%), and had been assaulted in the past six months (44% versus 36%) (all p<.05). Fewer than half the youths (49%) had a regular medical doctor, 50% reported unmet need for health care, and 61% visited an emergency department in the past six months., CONCLUSIONS: This sample of homeless youths with mental illness had low education, high rates of substance use disorders and victimization, and problems accessing services. These findings suggest that youths have trajectories to homelessness and service needs that are distinct from adults and may guide future planning for this vulnerable population.

N2  - A brief motivational intervention with 117 homeless adolescents was evaluated using a randomized design and 3-month follow-up. The intervention was designed to raise youths' concerns about their substance use, support harm reduction, and encourage greater service utilization at a collaborating agency. The study was designed to strengthen initial promising results of an earlier study (P. L. Peterson, J. S. Baer, E. A. Wells, J. A. Ginzler, & S. B. Garrett, 2006). Several modifications in the clinical protocol were included to enhance engagement with the intervention. Analyses revealed no significant benefits for intervention participants when homeless youths' substance use rates were compared with those of control participants. Service utilization during the intervention period increased for those receiving the intervention but returned to baseline levels at follow-up. Participants reported overall reductions in substance use over time. Differences between sampling methods for the current and previous study are discussed, as are the limitations of brief interventions with this population. Future research needs to elucidate mechanisms of change and service engagement for highly vulnerable youth. Copyright &copy; 2011 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam. All Rights Reserved.

T1  - Helping Individuals With Firearm Injuries
T2  - Helping Individuals With Firearm Injuries: a Cluster Randomized Trial
Y1  - 2015//
Y2  - 2015//
N2  - About 250 individuals present to an emergency department in King County, primarily Harborview Medical Center (HMC), for firearm-related injuries each year. Almost two-third of these patients require admission for their injuries. While the number of patients with firearm injuries who present to HMC is relatively small, these individuals are at substantially increased risk of subsequent re-hospitalization for another firearm or assault-related injury, arrest for firearm-related or violent crime, non-firearm-related nonviolent crime or firearm-related death in the five years after discharge from the hospital. Thus, interventions among this high risk population have the potential to reduce recidivism, morbidity, and mortality as well as decrease firearm violence and its consequences in the community., Patients with gunshot wounds (GSWs) seen at HMC receive many services; however, currently there is no standardized intervention offered to GSW patients. A number of hospitals across the country have created violence prevention and intervention programs to help patients who sustain violent injuries. These programs engage patients in the hospital during their recovery period, which is seen as an opportunity ("teachable moment") to change their life and reduce retaliation and recidivism. As a result of the growing number of violence prevention and intervention program, the National Network of Hospital-based Violence Intervention Programs, has been established. Through working groups, meetings, e-newsletter, and conferences, Network members collaborate in research and evaluation, explore opportunities for funding sustainability, develop and share best practices, and identify ways to collectively have an impact on policy. While the creation of this infrastructure is a step in the right direction, researchers have not rigorously tested the effectiveness of these intervention programs. Specifically, no trials have evaluated the effectiveness of hospital-based violence intervention programs offered to GSW victims., The investigators aim to conduct a cluster randomized trial of an violence intervention program that combines a brief, hospital-based intervention, a structured outreach program, and multi-agency attention. Study staff will provide a brief intervention derived from motivational interviewing (MI). MI is is a patient-centered behavioral technique based on the stages of change model and attempts to engage patients in order to find reason to change behavior. By empathetically exploring ambivalent feelings about health-related behavior, MI encourages reduction in risky behavior. Research has demonstrated the effectiveness of providing MI-based brief interventions in the Emergency Department (ED) or inpatient wards, primarily for alcohol use disorders but also for violent behaviors. Specifically, brief, MI interventions have been successful at reducing youth violence in large urban populations, with effects sustained through one year. Additionally, a behavioral-based intervention including MI targeting adolescents admitted to HMC with trauma showed a reduction in weapon carriage during the year post-hospitalization., A longitudinal outreach intervention program provides the added benefit of continued engagement. GSW patients must transition back to the community after their hospitalization, and the transitional period, when patients must navigate a complex and fragmented system of care, is especially challenging. Providing GSW patients with outreach and follow-up after the healthcare encounter holds promise for reducing their future violence and criminal activity. The Critical Time Intervention (CTI) approach may provide a strong framework for providing these patients with appropriate outreach and follow-up. Strong evidence supports CTI's effectiveness. The CTI model meets the Coalition for Evidence-based Policy's rigorous "Top Tier" standard for interventions: well-designed and implemented randomized controlled trials, preferably conducted in typical community settings, [that] produced sizable, sustained benefits to participants and/or society. CTI is a time-limited, evidence-based case management model that mobilizes support for society's most vulnerable individuals during periods of transition such as discharge from inpatient services to the community. It facilitates community integration and continuity of care by ensuring that a person has enduring ties to their community and support systems during these critical periods. CTI has been used worldwide among veterans, people with mental illness, homeless or incarcerated individuals, and many other groups. From the beginning, CTI was thought of as an intervention that could be applied in myriad contexts. This approach has the potential to provide an intervention framework for a second tier outreach to GSW victims in King and neighboring counties.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Opioid substitution therapy and needle exchanges have reduced blood-borne viruses (BBVs) among people who inject drugs (PWID). Some PWID continue to share injecting equipment., OBJECTIVES: To develop an evidence-based psychosocial intervention to reduce BBV risk behaviours and increase transmission knowledge among PWID, and conduct a feasibility trial among PWID comparing the intervention with a control., DESIGN: A pragmatic, two-armed randomised controlled, open feasibility trial. Service users were Steering Group members and co-developed the intervention. Peer educators co-delivered the intervention in London., SETTING: NHS or third-sector drug treatment or needle exchanges in Glasgow, London, Wrexham and York, recruiting January and February 2016., PARTICIPANTS: Current PWID, aged &ge;&thinsp;18 years., INTERVENTIONS: A remote, web-based computer randomisation system allocated participants to a three-session, manualised, psychosocial, gender-specific group intervention delivered by trained facilitators and BBV transmission information booklet plus treatment as usual (TAU) (intervention), or information booklet plus TAU (control)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recruitment, retention and follow-up rates measured feasibility. Feedback questionnaires, focus groups with participants who attended at least one intervention session and facilitators assessed the intervention's acceptability., RESULTS: A systematic review of what works to reduce BBV risk behaviours among PWID; in-depth interviews with PWID; and stakeholder and expert consultation informed the intervention. Sessions covered improving injecting technique and good vein care; planning for risky situations; and understanding BBV transmission. Fifty-six per cent (99/176) of eligible PWID were randomised: 52 to the intervention group and 47 to the control group. Only 24% (8/34) of male and 11% (2/18) of female participants attended all three intervention sessions. Overall, 50% (17/34) of men and 33% (6/18) of women randomised to the intervention group and 47% (14/30) of men and 53% (9/17) of women randomised to the control group were followed up 1 month post intervention. Variations were reported by location. The intervention was acceptable to both participants and facilitators. At 1 month post intervention, no increase in injecting in 'risky' sites (e.g. groin, neck) was reported by participants who attended at least one session. PWID who attended at least one session showed a trend towards greater reduction in injecting risk behaviours, a greater increase in withdrawal planning and were more confident about finding a vein. A mean cost of &pound;58.17 per participant was calculated for those attending one session, &pound;148.54 for those attending two sessions and &pound;270.67 for those attending all three sessions, compared with &pound;0.86 in the control group. Treatment costs across the centres vary as a result of the different levels of attendance, as total session costs are divided by attendees to obtain a cost per attendee. The economic analysis suggests that a cost-effectiveness study would be feasible given the response rates and completeness of data. However, we have identified aspects where the service use questionnaire could be abbreviated given the low numbers reported in several care domains. No adverse events were reported., FUTURE WORK: The intervention did not meet the complex needs of some PWID, more tailoring may be needed to reach PWID who are more frequent injectors, who are homeless and female., LIMITATIONS: Intervention delivery proved more feasible in London than other locations. Non-attendance at the York trial site substantially influenced the results., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN66453696 and PROSPERO 014:CRD42014012969., CONCLUSIONS: As only 19% of participants attended all three intervention sessions and 47% were followed up 1 month post intervention, a future definitive randomised controlled trial of the intervention is not feasible. Exposure to information on improving injecting techniques did not encourage riskier injecting practices or injecting frequency, and benefits were reported among attendees. The intervention has the potential to positively influence BBV prevention. Harm reduction services should ensure that the intervention content is routinely delivered to PWID to improve vein care and prevent BBVs., FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 21, No. 72.

N2  - Introduction: Recent evidence shows an increase in alcohol-related emergency department (ED) visits among youth. Highly publicized collegiate rituals such as Homecoming may create a climate for problematic alcohol use. This study describes the frequency of youth alcohol-related ED visits per year and during pre-specified ritualized drinking dates in one academic centre. Methods: This was a chart review of patients aged 12-24 with alcohol-related ED presentations between Sept 2013-Aug 2017. The National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) database was searched for visits with ICD-10 codes related to alcohol. The Canadian Hospital Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) database was also searched using the keyword alcohol. Duplicate visits were removed. Visits were excluded if patients had a history of psychosis, were held in the ED for involuntary psychiatric assessment, were homeless, were inmates from a correctional institute, if alcohol use was not mentioned and for complaints of sexual assault/domestic violence. Data abstraction by two reviewers used a standard form with variables predetermined. Differences were resolved with third party adjudication. Interrater reliability of the reviewers was assessed through duplicate review of 10% of randomly selected charts. A further 10% were assessed by a 3rd reviewer for extraction accuracy. Results: A total of 3, 256 ED visits were identified with 777 meeting exclusion criteria. The remaining 2, 479 visits were reviewed and subclassified into injury (51.8%), acute intoxication (45.1%) and mental health issue (3.2%). Interrater agreement was high for extracted variables with Kappa scores > 0.8. Despite a decrease in the region's youth population during the study period (28, 325 to 25, 125), overall standardized ED visits by youth increased by 12% (66, 538 to 78, 129). Adjusted for population, youth alcohol-related visits increased by 86.4% from 1, 557 in 2013-14 to 2, 902 in 2016-17. Co-ingestion of other substances was reported in 292 (11.8%) of visits, with cannabis the most common (57%). The 17 pre-specified ritualized days saw 578 (23.3%) of ED visits. Conclusion: Alcohol-related ED visits in youth are increasing in our region. Ritualized drinking dates appear to be particularly risky for youth with high rates of observed ED utilization. Strategies to manage high volume ritual days are being piloted, including temporary diversion to an in-hospital sobriety centre.

N2  - Objectives: High-risk youth and families-including homeless youth and families and foster care youth-represent a significant public health challenge in the United States. Although these youth and families are at risk for poor health, mental health, and social outcomes, there are innovative approaches and psychosocial interventions for these populations that can improve care Methods: Five perspectives on providing care to high-risk youth and families will be presented, including adapting interventions to meet the distinct needs of these populations, findings from unique individual and family-based interventions, and practical skills for providers. Results: Dr. Roya Ijadi-Maghsoodi from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) will present the perspectives of homeless veteran families and lessons from partnering with recently homeless parents to adopt a family resilience intervention. Dr. Niranjan Karnik from Rush University will describe a novel mobile health intervention delivered to homeless youth in Chicago. Dr. Norweeta Milburn from UCLA will discuss a brief family-based approach for recently homeless youth, the STRIVE (Support to Reunite, Involve, and Value Each Other) intervention, and implications for providers working with newly homeless adolescents. Dr. Lauren Marlotte from UCLA will deliver an overview of working with foster care families and foster youth in college and tools for providers. Dr. Jeanne Miranda of UCLA will discuss her work developing a manualized Adoption-Specific Intervention (ADAPT), an intervention for families adopting older youth from foster care, and results from a recent randomized trial. Dr. Patricia Lester of UCLA, an expert in familycentered interventions, will serve as a discussant. Conclusions: There are emerging interventions and approaches to reaching and improving care for high-risk youth and families. Child psychiatrists and mental health clinicians working on the frontlines can use these approaches and tools to improve care for these important populations.

N2  - Runaway youth are 6-12 times more likely to become infected with HIV than other youth. Using a quasi-experimental design, the efficacy of an HIV prevention program was evaluated over 2 years among 2 groups of runaways: (1) those at 2 shelters who received Street Smart, an intensive HIV intervention program, and (2) youth at 2 control shelters. Street Smart provided youth with access to health care and condoms and delivered a 10-session skill-focused prevention program based on social learning theory to youth. Prior to analysis of the intervention's outcomes, propensity scores were used to identify comparable subgroups of youth in the intervention (n = 101) and control conditions (n = 86). Compared to females in the control condition, females in the intervention condition significantly reduced their unprotected sexual acts at 2 years and alcohol use, marijuana use, and the number of drugs used over 12 months. Male adolescents in the intervention condition showed significant reductions in marijuana use over 6 months compared to control youth. Adolescent HIV prevention programs must proactively identify mechanisms for maintaining behavior change over the long-term, and innovative research designs are needed to allow examination of agency-level interventions.

T1  - Engaging Homeless Youth in Vocational Training to Meet Their Mental Health Needs
Y1  - 2017//
Y2  - 2017//
N2  - In response to the limited use of RCTs with homeless youth to test research-supported interventions, this study compares the efficacy and short-term outcomes of two interventions that combine employment and clinical services with homeless youth experiencing mental illness. The Social Enterprise Intervention (SEI) is a research-supported intervention using a group approach that engages homeless youth in paid employment as well as case-management and mental health services through involvement in an agency-run social enterprise. The Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model of supported employment is an individually focused, evidence-based intervention , which provides individuals with severe mental illness with customized, long-term, and integrated vocational, case-management, and clinical services to help them gain and maintain competitive employment., A randomized comparative efficacy trial of the short-term, nonvocational outcomes (depression, self-esteem, social support, housing stability) of the SEI and IPS was conducted over 20 months with 72 homeless youth at a homeless youth drop-in center in Los Angeles. This study answered two research questions: 1) Do homeless youth with mental illness participating in an employment intervention integrated with clinical services (SEI or IPS) experience improvements in their a) mental health status (self-esteem and depression); b) housing stability, and c) social support; and 2) What are the differences between the SEI and IPS groups on mental health, housing stability, and social support outcomes between baseline and follow-up?

T1  - Generating Evidence for a Support Package to Stabilize Youth Trajectories Out of Homelessness
T2  - Generating Evidence for a Comprehensive Support Package to Stabilize Youth Trajectories Out of Homelessness: a Tertiary Prevention Strategy
Y1  - 2017//
Y2  - 2017//
N2  - In response to the challenges outlined above, and with the support of a grant from the Ontario Ministry of Child and Youth Services, the investigators developed and tested a tertiary prevention strategy called the Housing Outreach Program Collaborative (HOP-C) which launched in the summer of 2015. In this approach the investigators focused on collaborations and interventions that have the greatest potential to be effective with this population. The investigators brought together partners from a number of sectors in the GTA and have tested a 3-pronged set of supports (intervention described in detail in the methods):, -  Transitional Case Management, -  Mental Health Interventions: Group, individual, family, -  Peer Support This is an intensive, 6-month critical time intervention - one that jointly      addresses many points of vulnerability (mental health crises, housing instability,      justice involvement) while fostering resilience and connection with resources in      employment, education and training domains. It is unique in both content      comprehensiveness and integrated process of delivery. Also important was the development      of a collaborative and responsive partnering process, to facilitate effective      organizational interfaces and seamless service integration so participants can      experience a tailored and coherent set of supports. With CAMH, the Centre for      Mindfulness Studies, Covenant House, LOFT, and SKETCH at the service level and the      Wellesley Institute leading evaluation, the investigators have carefully attended to a      collective impact framework., This initiative has proven feasible and is demonstrating good outcomes - with excellent youth engagement, reports of lower social isolation, improved mental health, and engagement with resources, and spin-off benefits of closer collaboration between organizations. The investigators successfully met the target of youth engagement, with a total of 31 youth participating, minimal attrition (n=2), and the investigators observed no indications that HOP-C resulted in risk of any form, both with respect to the intervention itself and the mixed methods research methodology. This promising feasibility work formed the foundation from which the investigators were successful in obtaining a grant from the Local Poverty Reduction Fund to support the study described in this proposal., Current Project Determine through a randomized trial in Toronto if the positive outcomes the investigators are observing are due solely or primarily to transitional case management and if the additional peer and mental health components are necessary., Engaging in intensive, tertiary prevention shows clear promise in disrupting a cycle of poverty and marginalization at a critical time - if proven and scaled a key driver of chronic homelessness would be addressed., Research Questions The objective of this two-part project is to examine the effectiveness and transferability of the Housing Outreach Program-Collaboration (HOP-C) transitional intervention. HOP-C has proven to be feasible with promising outcomes in the Toronto proof-of-concept work currently underway., 1. Are the benefits of the complex HOP-C intervention with all components in place greater than transitional case management in isolation?, &bull; It is hypothesized that the full model will provide benefit in domains of housing stability, mental health, and quality of life that are significantly greater than case management alone., The investigators have data in hand from their recent national work in the area which provides data on 'treatment as usual' or the outcomes that attend typically available supports. The proposed trial will unpack benefit and be essential in economic and viability arguments to be made going forward.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Homeless smokers want to quit smoking but face numerous barriers to doing so, including a lack of social support and pervasive smoking in the setting of homelessness. Mobile phone possession is common among homeless people, and a short message service (SMS) could address challenges to smoking cessation in this population by providing homeless smokers with virtual support to manage ubiquitous social triggers to smoke. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of a freely available but underused stop-smoking SMS program on smoking abstinence among homeless smokers. METHODS: In 10/2015-06/2016, we conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a sequential mixed-methods design that used qualitative interviews to explain the quantitative results. Eligibility criteria included age &ge;18 years, current homelessness, current smoking (&ge;5 cigarettes/day), and desire to quit smoking in the next month. Control arm (N = 25) and SMS arm (N = 25) participants were offered nicotine patches, weekly in-person counseling, and a mobile phone. SMS arm participants additionally received help with enrolling in Smokefree TXT, a free service administered by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) that sends 1-5 SMS messages daily and offers on-demand tips for managing cravings, mood symptoms, and slips. The primary outcome was smoking abstinence, defined as an exhaled carbon monoxide <8 parts per million, assessed 14 times over 8 weeks of follow-up and analyzed using repeated-measures logistic regression with generalized estimating equations. The secondary outcomes were use of Smokefree TXT, assessed by data obtained from NCI; satisfaction with and appropriateness of Smokefree TXT, assessed by surveys and in-depth interviews; and mobile phone retention, assessed by self-report. RESULTS: 67% of eligible individuals agreed to participate. Smoking abstinence did not differ significantly between arms at the end of treatment (SMS 16% vs. control 8%; p = 0.67) or averaged across all time points (SMS vs. control OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.30-2.84). 88%of SMS armparticipants enrolled in SmokefreeTXT; of these, 32% responded to &ge;1 interactive prompts sent by the program. Among SmokefreeTXT enrollees who completed exit surveys (N = 15), 67% were very or extremely satisfied with the program. However, qualitative interviews revealed that some participants felt the messages were &ldquo;impersonal, like a robot.&rdquo; Several found the number of messages &ldquo;overwhelming&rdquo; and wanted &ldquo;less texts a day.&rdquo; Others noted practical barriers to receiving the SMS messages, including limited phone battery life and lost or stolen phones. 40% of SMS arm participants retained their study-supplied mobile phone for the 8-week duration of the trial. CONCLUSIONS: SmokefreeTXT, when added to nicotine patch therapy and in-person counseling, did not improve smoking abstinence in this RCT of homeless smokers. SMS interventions for homeless smokers may need to be better tailored to their unique needs and combined with efforts to promote mobile phone retention.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Three-quarters of homeless adults smoke cigarettes, contributing to 3- to 5-fold higher rates of tobacco-attributable mortality compared with the general population. Homeless smokers want to quit smoking, but the proportion who are able to do so is one-fifth the national average and studies of conventional treatment approaches have yielded modest results. Financial incentives for smoking abstinence have shown promise in non-experimental studies of homeless smokers, but randomized trial data are lacking in this population. We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial of financial incentives for smoking abstinence among homeless smokers in Boston, MA. METHODS: All study procedures occurred between October 2015 and June 2016 at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program. Eligibility criteria included age &ge;18 years, current smoking (&ge;5 cigarettes/day, &ge;100 cigarettes lifetime), current homelessness, and desire to quit smoking in the next month. Individuals were not excluded for current drug or alcohol use. Participants randomized to the financial incentives arm (N = 25) could earn escalating monetary rewards ($15-$35) for carbon monoxide (CO)-defined smoking abstinence (<8 parts per million [ppm]), assessed 14 times over 8 weeks. Control arm participants (N = 25) were given $10 at each assessment visit, regardless of their exhaled CO levels. All study payments were made onto reloadable debit cards issued to each participant at enrollment. Participants in both arms were offered nicotine patches and weekly behavioral counseling. The primary outcome was a repeated measure of point-in-time smoking abstinence (CO <8 ppm) across the 14 study visits. The secondary outcome was point-in-time abstinence at 8 weeks. Exploratory smoking outcomes were self-reported past 1-day and 7-day abstinence from 1) any cigarette and 2) any puff of a cigarette. Other outcomes included quit attempts, nicotine patch use, counseling attendance, and changes in alcohol and drug use severity scores. RESULTS: Compared with control arm participants, financial incentive arm participants had greater point-in-time abstinence overall (OR 7.28, 95% CI 2.89, 18.3) and at the end of treatment (48.0% vs. 8%, p = 0.004). Similar effects were seen for past 1-day abstinence, but the rates of past 7-day puff abstinence were negligible (0-4%) in both arms. Incentive arm participants made significantly more past-month quit attempts at 4 weeks (p = 0.03). Nicotine patch use (p = 0.80) and counseling attendance (p = 0.43) did not differ significantly between groups. There were no significant changes in alcohol or drug use severity scores in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Among homeless smokers, financial incentives increased brief smoking abstinence and quit attempts without worsening substance use. This approach is promising but requires modification to achieve more sustained smoking abstinence in this vulnerable population.

T1  - Preventing Behavior and Health Problems in Foster Teens
Y1  - 2012//
Y2  - 2012//
N2  - The cost of child welfare services in the U.S. has been estimated at $20 billion per year. During the past decade, the number of teenagers in foster care has nearly doubled. Numerous studies have documented that these adolescents are at high-risk for developing serious problems, including substance use, participation in health-risking sexual behaviors, involvement in the juvenile justice system, serious educational problems and school drop-out, failed placements/foster care "drift" and homelessness. Yet, there is little research on the characteristics of interventions that can be used to guide the improvement of services for this vulnerable population of youngsters. The proposed study extends our previous research with adolescents referred for serious behavioral and emotional problems and research with elementary-aged children in foster care to a test of the efficacy of a preventive intervention for adolescents placed with foster and kin care providers in the San Diego County Child Welfare System. Two hundred and forty adolescents and their foster/kin care providers will participate (i.e., 60 in a foster/kin parent training only condition, 60 in a parent training plus youth skill training condition, and 120 in a casework "as usual" control condition). In addition to testing the efficacy of the two levels of intervention, the investigators propose to examine the effects of the intervention on a set of youth behavioral and health-related outcomes. Parenting mediators to be tested include positive parenting, parental supervision, and non-harsh discipline. Youth mediators are social competence, commitment to school, and knowledge about norms related to health-risking behaviors including substance use and high-risk sexual behavior. In addition, theoretical hypotheses about the effects of early risk/adversity factors to youth outcomes will be examined, and an economic analysis will be conducted to examine the relative benefits and costs associated with the two levels of intervention.

T1  - Longitudinal Impact of a Family Critical Time Intervention on Children in High-Risk Families Experiencing Homelessness: a Randomized Trial
Y1  - 2015//
Y2  - 2015//
N2  - A randomized trial compared effects of a Family Critical Time Intervention (FCTI) to usual care for children in 200 newly homeless families in which mothers had diagnosable mental illness or substance problems. Adapted from an evidence-based practice to prevent chronic homelessness for adults with mental illnesses, FCTI combines housing and structured, time-limited case management to connect families leaving shelter with community services. Families were followed at five time points over 24 months. Data on 311 children-99 ages 1.5-5 years, 113 ages 6-10 years, and 99 ages 11-16 years-included mother-, teacher-, and child-reports of mental health, school experiences, and psychosocial well-being. Analyses used hierarchical linear modeling to investigate intervention effects and changes in child functioning over time. Referral to FCTI reduced internalizing and externalizing problems in preschool-aged children and externalizing for adolescents 11-16. The intervention led to declines in self-reported school troubles for children 6-10 and 11-16. Both experimental and control children in all age groups showed reductions in symptoms over time. Although experimental results were scattered, they suggest that FCTI has the potential to improve mental health and school outcomes for children experiencing homelessness.

N2  - BACKGROUND: New injection drug users (IDUs) are at high risk for blood-borne viral infections. Given U.S. policy to only fund proven-effective HIV prevention interventions, insights into conducting intervention trials among young IDUs are provided here by describing methods and participants' characteristics in the CIDUS III/DUIT study., METHODS: In 2002-2004, 15-30-year-old IDUs in Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle were recruited through community outreach, advertising and coupon-based participant referrals. Baseline interviews assessed sociodemographics, injection, and sexual behaviors. Antibody tests for HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses (HAV, HBV, and HCV) were conducted. IDUs who were HIV and HCV antibody negative at baseline were eligible to participate in a randomized controlled HIV/HCV prevention trial. Follow-up assessments were conducted 3 and 6 months post-intervention. Data were analyzed to identify participant differences at baseline by city, trial enrollment, and trial retention., RESULTS: Baseline assessments were completed by 3285 IDUs. Participants were mean age 23.8 years, 69% male, 64% White, 17% Hispanic, and 8% Black. Seroprevalence of HIV, HCV, HBV, and HAV antibodies were 2.9, 34.4, 22.4, and 19.3%, respectively. Of the 2062 (62.7%) baseline participants who were HIV and HCV antibody negative, 859 (41.7%) were randomized. At least one follow-up assessment was completed by 712 (83%) randomized participants. Contextual factors, primarily homelessness, were associated with lower enrollment and retention., CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment and retention of young-adult IDUs for complex intervention trials is complicated, yet feasible. Risk behaviors among participants enrolling in and completing the trial reflected those eligible to enroll.

N2  - Injection drug users (IDUs) acquire the majority of new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and frequently use alcohol. Alcohol abuse accelerates liver disease among HCV-infected persons, can reduce the effectiveness of treatment for HCV infection and may be a contraindication for HCV treatment. HCV seropositive, HIV-negative IDUs aged 18-35 years in Baltimore, New York City and Seattle who were enrolled in a behavioral risk-reduction intervention trial underwent computerized self-interviews to assess baseline alcohol use and dependence and medical history. We measured problem alcohol use using the 10-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scale. Of 598 participants, 84% responded "false" to: "it is safe for a person with HCV to drink alcohol". Problem drinking, defined as score > or =8 on AUDIT, was identified in 37%. Correlates of scoring > or =8 on AUDIT included homelessness, male gender, primarily injecting speedballs, having injected with used needles, prior alcohol treatment and depression. Although most HCV seropositive IDUs in our sample appear informed about their increased risk of liver disease from alcohol, two-fifths screened positive for problem alcohol use. These findings underscore the importance of referring HCV-positive persons to effective alcohol treatment programs to reduce future liver damage and improve eligibility for and effectiveness of treatment of HCV.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study examines key themes from narrative interviews conducted with 43 homeless adults with mental disorders 18 months after random assignment to Housing First with intensive supports or to treatment as usual (no housing or supports through the study). METHOD: Coding and thematic analysis of semistructured interviews was based on 2 research questions from participants' perspectives: (a) What changes were perceived over time? (b) What factors facilitated or hindered change? RESULTS: The majority of participants assigned to Housing First reported positive change across multiple domains as a result of stable housing; whereas the majority of treatment as usual participants reported negative or neutral change. Key themes included feelings of security and pride; adjusting to living alone; housing as a learning process; and developing meaningful activity. The sense of security associated with stable housing was the most influential factor that supported change. Factors that helped or hindered change clustered into 4 key themes: the type and quality of services; the cumulative effects of trauma; social ties; and concurrent substance use. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our findings provide important context to the emerging body of quantitative research on Housing First and recovery from homelessness. Participants' experiences of recovery, particularly as it relates to housing and supports, shifts in identity, and meaningful activity must be acknowledged and incorporated into the design and evaluation of public services, and policy and service reforms.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death among homeless people. This study examines CVD risk factors and 30-year CVD risk in a population of homeless individuals with mental illness. METHODS: CVD risks factors were assessed in 352 homeless individuals with mental illness in Toronto, Canada, at the time of their enrollment in the At Home/Chez Soi Project, a randomized trial of a Housing First intervention. The 30-year risk for CVD (coronary death, myocardial infarction, and fatal or nonfatal stroke) was calculated using published formulas and examined for association with need for mental health services, diagnosis of psychotic disorder, sex, ethnicity, access to a family physician and diagnosis of substance dependence. RESULTS: The 30-year CVD risk for study participants was 24.5+/-18.4%, more than double the reference normal of 10.1+/-7.21% (difference=-13.0% 95% CI -16.5% to -9.48%). Univariate analyses revealed 30-year CVD risk was greater among males (OR 3.99, 95% CI 2.47 to 6.56) and those who were diagnosed with substance dependence at baseline (OR 1.94 95% CI 1.23 to 3.06) and reduced among those who were non-white (OR 0.62 95% CI 0.39 to 0.97). In adjusted analyses, only male sex (OR 4.71 95% CI 2.76 to 8.05) and diagnosis of substance dependence (OR 1.78 95% CI 1.05 to 3.00) remained associated with increased CVD risk. CONCLUSIONS: Homeless people with mental illness have highly elevated 30-year CVD risk, particularly among males and those diagnosed with substance dependence. This study adds to the literature by reporting on CVD risk in a particularly vulnerable population of homeless individuals experiencing mental illness, and by using a 30-year CVD risk calculator which provides a longer time-frame during which the effect of modifiable CVD risk factors could be mitigated.

Y2  - 2017//
N2  - The focus of this study (Engaging Seronegative Youth to Optimize HIV Prevention Continuum) - will be to stop HIV-related risk acts and to encourage youth at high risk for HIV to adopt antiretroviral medications as treatment and prevention (either pre exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or post exposure prophylaxis) among gay, bisexual and transgender and/or homeless youth with contact with the criminal justice system in the HIV epicenters of Los Angeles and New Orleans. A cohort of 1500 youth at the highest risk of seroconverting over 24 months will be identified. The goal will be to optimize the HIV Prevention Continuum over 24 months. The proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to compare youth outcomes when randomized to one of four automated and person-mediated social media delivered intervention conditions: 1) Automated Messaging and Monitoring Intervention (AMMI) only (n=900) consisting of daily motivational, instructional, and referral text-messaging (SMS), and brief, weekly SMS monitoring surveys of outcomes; 2) Peer Support through social media plus AMMI (n=200) via private online discussion boards; 3) Coaching plus AMMI (n=200) to provide service linkages, eligibility support, appointment coordination and follow-up, communication with healthcare providers, and brief motivational and strengths-based counseling for linkage and retention to prevention, mental health, and substance abuse services; and, 4) Coaching plus Peer Support and AMMI (n=200).

T1  - Examining the Effectiveness of a Critical Time Intervention to Stabilize Trajectories Out of Homelessness for Youth
Y1  - 2021//
Y2  - 2021//
N2  - Problem Statement: This proposal addresses the problem of youth not being adequately, supported as they attempt to transition out of homelessness. This problem leads to frequent, cycling in and out of homelessness, protracted periods of homelessness, and increased, exposure to an array of serious risks to health and wellbeing. This is not just an issue of, housing. While adequate housing is necessary to youth exiting homelessness it is not, in and, of itself, sufficient to ensure success in sustaining housing nor flourishing as a result of, housing., Objective: This proposal tests a complex, critical time intervention for youth in transition, out of homelessness. This intervention, which is team-based and comprised of integrated case, management, peer support, and mental health supports, has proven feasible in pilot and, feasibility trials. Its objective is to stabilize housing trajectories and improve outcomes, in major life domains., Specific Aims: The primary aim of this study is to determine if the provision of 1 year of, the critical time intervention HOP-C can improve the outcomes of youth who have transitioned, into stable housing in the past 6 months. It is hypothesized that, compared with treatment as, usual, housing, employment, education, and mental health outcomes will be significantly, better for youth who receive HOP-C and that these gains will be sustained. Changes in quality, of life, social supports, and psychological wellbeing will be explored as secondary outcomes., Partners: This study builds on a partnership between the Centre for Addiction and Mental, Health (research capability, mental health service expertise) and two established Toronto, service providers focusing on homeless youth populations (Covenant House - Toronto; LOFT, Community Services)., Study Design: This study is a single blind, randomized controlled trial comparing the, outcomes of the transitional intervention described above with typical supports provided in, the community. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, mid-point (6 months),, post-intervention (1 year), and at 6 months follow up., Implications: From a trial design perspective, the proposed study would provide evidence, supporting a rationale for future trials and wide implementation. Pending positive outcomes,, this would flow into multisite trial and implementation grant applications and further, collaborations with others working within Canada and elsewhere. More broadly, this line of, investigation has synergy with the increasingly larger and better-organized movements towards, addressing homelessness in Canada. These efforts have included At Home/Chez soi - the largest, study to date of housing first and Making the Shift, an NCE-funded collaborative effort, towards ending youth homelessness in Canada. Collectively, these developments (in which the, applicants are substantively involved), present the opportunity for both scaling the critical, time intervention proposed here and its ultimately being combined with other approaches, (e.g., housing first, family reunification, support in transitions from protection and, justice systems). Such systems-oriented strategies, girded by evidence, hold the greatest, promise for ameliorating the problem of youth homelessness and homelessness overall in, Canada.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To measure the prevalence of HIV/AIDS risk behaviors and related factors in a large, probability-based sample of boys and girls aged 12-17 years living on the streets of Egypt's largest urban centers of Greater Cairo and Alexandria., METHODS: Time-location sampling (TLS) was used to recruit a cross-sectional sample of street children. Procedures entailed using key informants and field observation to create a sampling frame of locations at predetermined time intervals of the day, where street children congregate in the two cities, selecting a random sample of time-locations from the complete list, and intercepting children in the selected time-locations to assess eligibility and conduct interviews. Interviews gathered basic demographic information, life events on the street (including violence, abuse, forced sex), sexual and drug use behaviors, and HIV/AIDS knowledge., RESULTS: A total of 857 street children were enrolled in the two cities, with an age, sex, and time-location composition matching the sampling frame. The majority of these children had faced harassment or abuse (93%) typically by police and other street children, had used drugs (62%), and, among the older adolescents, were sexually active (67%). Among the sexually active 15-17-year-olds, most reported multiple partners (54%) and never using condoms (52%). Most girls (53% in Greater Cairo and 90% in Alexandria) had experienced sexual abuse. The majority of street children experienced more than one of these risks. Overlaps with populations at highest risk for HIV were substantial, namely men who have sex with men, commercial sex workers, and injection drug users., CONCLUSION: Our study using a randomized TLS approach produced a rigorous, diverse, probability-based sample of street children and documented very high levels of multiple concurrent risks. Our findings strongly advocate for multiple services including those addressing HIV and STI prevention and care, substance use, shelters, and sensitization of authorities to the plight of street children in Egypt.

Y2  - 2020//
N2  - INTERVENTION:                  HF4Y is based on the understanding that the causes and conditions of youth homelessness are distinct from adults, and therefore the solutions must be distinct as well. Just as Housing First addresses homelessness for adults, HF4Y addresses youth homelessness through a youth lens. HF4Y is grounded in the belief that all young people have a right to housing and that those who have experienced homelessness will do better and recover more effectively if they are first provided with housing.                  To find out which kind of supported housing works best, the researchers are comparing young people receiving Housing First with those in Services As Usual in two different regions, Ottawa and Toronto. This means that those who agree to participate will be assigned at random to receive either Housing First (rent supplements and support services from a case manager).                  The intervention group, known as the Housing First For Youth (HF4Y), receive programming delivered by YYouth Services Bureau (YSB [Ottawa]) and Woodgreen Community Services (WGCS [Toronto]) in accordance with the HF4Y framework, including the provision of housing subsidy, for the duration of the study (two years). They are offered housing options with no preconditions, and provided an array of support options related to housing retention, well-being, income and employment, education, social inclusion, and complementary support                  The control group, known as the Services As Usual (SAU) group have access to supports and to regular housing available in each community for young people, including available income support, drop-ins, health/mental health clinics, emergency shelters, transitional housing and longer-term housing. Participants in this group are provided wi, CONDITION: Youth homelessness ; Not Applicable, PRIMARY OUTCOME: ;                 1.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Reductions in runaways' sexual risk behaviors were evaluated in response to an intensive program to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)., DESIGN: In a nonrandomized control trial, sexual risk behaviors among 78 runaways at one residential shelter who received up to 30 HIV/AIDS intervention sessions were compared with 67 runaways at a nonintervention shelter with sexual behaviors assessed at baseline and 3 and 6 months., SETTING: Runaways were recruited from the only two publicly funded shelters in New York, NY., PARTICIPANTS: The runaways were aged 11 to 18 years, 64% female, and predominantly black or Hispanic., INTERVENTION: The intervention addressed general knowledge about HIV/AIDS, coping skills, access to health care and other resources, and individual barriers to safer sex., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Consistent condom use, a high-risk pattern of sexual behavior, and sexual abstinence over a 3-month time frame were assessed., MAIN RESULTS: As the number of intervention sessions increased, runaways' reports of consistent condom use increased significantly (at 3 months, unique R2 = .06, P less than .05; at 6 months, unique R2 = .09, P less than .05), and their reports of engaging in a high-risk pattern of sexual behavior decreased significantly (at 3 months, unique R2 = .03, P = .06; at 6 months, unique R2 = .04, P less than .05). Abstinence did not change., CONCLUSIONS: The demonstrated effectiveness of the intensive HIV/AIDS program highlights the importance of enlarging the scope of most current HIV/AIDS prevention programs.

N2  - INTERVENTION: Houvast (Dutch for 'grip') is a strength based method grounded in scientific evidence as well as 'what works' principles. Houvast is aimed at improving the quality of life of homeless youths bij focusing on their strengths stimulating there capacity for autonomy and self-reliance.  The social workers of these service accommodations received a four day training given by experienced and certificated trainers. The managers received a two day training. In addition to the training in the Houvast method an implementation plan, including coaching, is executed during the period of data collection. The standard length of residential care is six months: six weeks for the setting of personal recovery goals based on individual strengths and resources; three months for the execution of the personal goals; and six weeks for evaluation. The intensity and frequency of the care youths receive depends on the type of care: contact hours in ambulant care varies on average between 2 to 6 hours a week, but is usually much higher in residential care. The Houvast method includes several instruments like the &lsquo;strengths inventory&rsquo; and the &lsquo;action plan&rsquo;. Participating service accommodations will be randomly assigend to an experimental or control group. The social workers in the experimental group work according to the Houvast method. The social workers working in the service accommodations of the control group provide care as usual.   During the period in which youths receive ambulant or residential care from social workers, youths in the experimental group receive care according to the Houvast method., CONDITION: ;     Quality of life, Efficacy, Homeless youths, Service accomodations, Strength based, Resilience, Fidelity ; ;    , PRIMARY OUTCOME: 1.

N2  - This study examined the effects of cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBT) on the self-esteem, depression, and self-efficacy of runaway adolescents residing in a shelter in Seoul, South Korea. The study used a control group pretest-posttest design. The experimental group and the control group consisted of 14 and 13 male subjects, respectively, with subjects having been randomly assigned to these groups. The experimental group participated in a CBT that consisted of eight sessions over an 8-week period; the control group did not participate in the program. To examine the effects of the CBT on dependent variables, the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used. The scores on depression decreased significantly (z = -2.325, p = .02) and those on self-efficacy increased significantly (z = -2.098, p = .03) after the intervention in the experimental group. There was no significant change on self-esteem (z = -1.19, p = .23). In the control group, the scores on depression, self-esteem, and self-efficacy did not change significantly after the intervention period. The CBT developed in this study consisted of structured and specific content that could be usefully applied to runaway adolescents residing in a shelter.

T1  - My Life: evaluation of Self-determination Enhancement for Adolescents in Foster Care
Y1  - 2012//
Y2  - 2012//
N2  - Compared to their same age peers in the general population, youth who transition to adult living from foster care are less likely to have stable housing, to be connected to a caring adult, to graduate from high school, to go to college, or to be employed (e.g., Avery, 2001; Pecora et al., 2003; Goerge et al., 2002). They are more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviors, to become a single parent, and to be homeless or involved in the criminal justice system (e.g., Courtney et al., 2006; Smithgall, Gladden, Yang & Goerge, 2005). While consensus exists about the poor outcomes of these youth and policies have been adopted (e.g., Foster Care Independence Act) aimed at improving their transition, evidence-based practices have yet to be validated for achieving this goal., Skill development focused on self-determination enhancement, shown to be associated with transition success of young people in special education, could have unrealized potential to prepare youth in foster care for the sudden independence they experience when they abruptly age out of foster care. The overlapping nature of these at risk groups (approximately 40% of youth in foster care receive special education services) further suggests that skill development for self-determination enhancement could have cross-cutting benefits. To gather preliminary efficacy and feasibility data for youth approaching transition from foster homes, a pilot study using a randomized, 2 groups X 3 repeated measures design was conducted in Oregon (entitled My Life). Sixty youth, ages 16.5 through 17.5, in foster care and special education, were randomly assigned to either a control group that received community as usual services (CAU) or an experimental group that received one-to-one coaching designed to enhance self-determination (My Life). The My Life intervention group experienced a statistically significant increase in self-determination (as measured by the ARC; Wehmeyer & Kelchner, 1995) in comparison to the control group. Youth who participated in the intervention were also more likely to exhibit improvement in employment outcomes and in overall well being and to report greater involvement in the transition planning process over time as compared to the control group. In addition to providing evidence of its efficacy, the My Life pilot provided important feasibility information and estimates of effect size., Given the promising findings of our randomized controlled pilot of the My Life intervention, the goal of this R01 proposal is to undertake a full-scale efficacy trial of the My Life program. We are proposing to expand the work conducted in our initial investigation to include all youth preparing to exit foster care (i.e., youth receiving and not receiving special education services), and to specifically assess the impact of the intervention on mental health. The proposed study, which builds on the promising findings of our initial work, will provide important information on the efficacy of the model for all youth exiting the foster care system, providing data on the intervention's direct effects on critical outcomes, including quality of life, mental health, education, employment, employment and independent living, and whether enhanced self-determination mediates, at least partially, the intervention's effects on these critical outcomes. Additionally, the study will investigate whether disability, gender and race moderate the effect of the intervention on distal outcomes. Trauma symptoms and placement instability experienced at baseline will be considered as covariates; the potential direct effects of the intervention on these key foster care experiences also will be explored at completion of treatment and follow along. The proposed study has four specific aims: 1) We will recruit 210 foster youth, 16.5 to 17.5 years of age and randomly assign them to either the My Life intervention group or a community as usual control group that receives typical services (CAU). The intervention is designed to increase youth's self-determination in preparation for aging out of care and to provide for follow along assessment of their outcomes during this challenging and high-risk period. To recruit youth, we are collaborating with Oregon DHS and will target Oregon's most densely populated area: Multnomah County; 2) We will use a multiple agent, multiple indicator strategy for measuring key constructs to assess youth at baseline, intervention termination (12-month post-baseline) and follow-up (12-month post-intervention completion). We also will collect DHS Foster Care and school district archival records at these three time points. Brief phone interviews will be conducted every 60 days with participating youth regarding recent service and support utilization, global ratings in key outcome areas, stressful events, and contact with supportive adults. Thus, a total of 13 60-day phone interviews will be conducted over the entire 24-month period of study enrollment; 3) Using a series of modeling analyses, we will test intervention efficacy and the key elements of our theoretical model. Specifically, we will test for stability versus change of self-determination, mental health adjustment, academic achievement, quality of life, employment and independent living, with intervention group assignment (My Life vs. CAU) modeled as a dummy variable with anticipated direct effects on outcomes for the key constructs. In a second series of analyses, we will test the hypothesized mediator effects of self-determination on mental health adjustment, academic success, quality of life, employment and independent living, and explore whether disability, gender and race moderate the impact of the intervention on key outcomes. The influence of trauma and placement instability on distal outcomes will be examined, as will the intervention's impact on these key foster care experiences. 4) We will track fidelity of implementation to document adherence to intervention protocols and perform analyses to identify intervention components actively associated with major outcomes as well as possible differences in intervention components for foster youth with a disability versus those without. Oregon DHS has a strong interest in this project and we anticipate that they will work to maintain delivery of active intervention components.

N2  - Cognitive distortions are conceptualized as one of the most potent predictors of suicide. However, little is known about the mediating and moderating mechanisms linking cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation. The present study examined a prospective moderated mediation model linking cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation, with drug use, social problem-solving, and perceived burdensomeness as the mediators and childhood sexual abuse as the moderator. Participants included 150 homeless youth who participated in a randomized clinical trial for suicide intervention. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. We analyzed the data using a multiple-group path model. Findings showed that social problem-solving and perceived burdensomeness sequentially mediated the association between cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation regardless of childhood sexual abuse, whereas drug use mediated the association between cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation only among youth reporting no history of sexual abuse. Findings highlight how coping processes, both adaptive and maladaptive, operate differently to predict suicidal ideation contingent on the effects of childhood sexual abuse in the context of cognitive distortions. Findings also underscore the importance of addressing the effects of childhood abuse to facilitate the efficiency of interventions that seek to reduce suicidal ideation among a vulnerable population.

T1  - Substance Use and Sexual Risk Reduction Intervention for Homeless Youth
T2  - Brief AOD Use and Sexual Risk Reduction Group MI Intervention for Homeless
Y1  - 2014//
Y2  - 2014//
N2  - This study addresses an important gap in prevention services for homeless youth by conducting a pilot test of an innovative 4-session integrated substance use and sexual risk reduction program for this population that is feasible to deliver in settings where these youth seek services. The study has 2 specific aims:, Aim 1: Investigate whether homeless youth who participate in the program show reductions in substance use and intentions, behavior and consequences, as well as sexual activity intentions and risk behavior, over a 3-month period compared to a usual care control sample of youth who do not receive the program., Aim 2: Gain a better understanding of intervention effects by exploring whether improvements in self-efficacy, readiness to change, outcome expectancies, and exposure to peer substance use and offers serve as explanatory mechanisms for reductions in substance use- and sexual activity- related intentions and risk behaviors among youth who participate in the program., The program will be evaluated using a form of group-randomized design, although with crossover of conditions and groups to avoid the problems of power reduction associated with conventional group randomization. The unit of analysis will be the individual, but individuals will be assigned to groups based on the agency where they are seeking services. Youth at two drop-in centers serving homeless youth will either be in the intervention condition or a "usual care" control condition. The field period will be divided into four phases. The two agencies will alternate across phases in serving as the "intervention site" or "control site," with each agency having a total of two intervention phases and two control phases., Intervention Condition: This condition involves a four-session voluntary intervention that is delivered within a drop-in center setting and is based on the investigator's previous intervention work with adolescents and young adults. Each session lasts approximately 1 hour. The intervention focuses on both sexual risk behavior and substance use. Although some sessions focus more heavily on sexual risk and others on substance use, each session includes content that emphasizes the interrelated nature of these two risk behaviors. In all sessions, participants will receive a personalized feedback sheet that specifically addresses a topic being discussed during that particular session. An motivational interviewing approach will be used to present material during the group sessions., "Usual Care" Condition: The "usual care" condition reflects the resources typically available in settings that serve homeless youth: an HIV informational brochure that discusses the connection between substance use and HIV risk, and a Community Resource Guide that lists free or low-cost substance use and HIV-related services.

N2  - A federally-funded research project for the Bridge Independent Living Project was designed to determine whether this structured residential program would have significant impact on the lives of 16- and 17-year-old homeless youth as compared to a similar control group. A non-equivalent control group design was employed in which youth referred to the independent living project were assessed on several personality dimensions before entering the program and at a 6-14 month follow-up. Instruments used were the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, the Lanyon Psychological Screening Inventory, and the Rotter Locus of Control Scale. Data were also collected on education and employment status, living situation, and behavior problems. Control youth from whom the same data were collected received other services from Bridge including counseling, General Educational Development, and vocational programs, but were living at home, with friends, or in other residential programs. Demographic data and entry assessment information were collected on 21 program and 36 control youth. One year follow-up data were available for 12 program and 18 control youth. At follow-up, program youth showed statistically significant gains in self-concept and became significantly less defensive than control youth. There was a trend in program youth toward less alienation or emotional problems compared to control youth, but no significant changes in sense of personal control for program youth. Program youth were found to be significantly more often employed and in school or had obtained a high school diploma, and were significantly more often in stable living situations than were control youth. Numerous tables and the survey forms are included. (NB)

N2  - Little is known regarding the specific types of service models and collaborations that are necessary to support diverse populations of youth in transition out of homelessness. Transitional supports addressing the complex needs of this population are needed to stabilize the array of housing arrangements that youth access. This study was a pilot randomized controlled trial of one such critical time intervention, called the Housing Outreach Program-Collaboration (HOP-C). HOP-C is a multicomponent, multidisciplinary intervention that provides 6 months of mental health and peer support, along with transitional case management to youth who have transitioned into some form of stable housing out of homelessness. In this trial, 65 youth were randomized to receive HOP-C plus treatment as usual or transitional case management plus treatment as usual. Outcome assessments were completed by 30 treatment and 28 control participants. The findings suggest that this intervention is feasible with mental health, employment or education, and housing metrics favoring HOP-C with odds ratios ranging from 2.28 to 3.18 and better subjective housing stability. Other indicators showed less change. HOP-C appears feasible and should be tested in a fully powered trial, providing the intervention for a duration longer than 6 months. Overall, these data suggest the potential benefit in fostering city-level, multidisciplinary teams sourced from several organizations to support youth transitioning out of homelessness. Pragmatic trial method considerations for this population are also addressed as are the ethical considerations pertinent to engaging highly marginalized youth in clinical trials.

N2  - Examination of differences between primary alcohol and drug abusing adolescents can provide valuable direction to intervention efforts, though little research in this area has been conducted. The current study compared primary alcohol and primary drug abusing runaway adolescents who were randomly assigned to family therapy or treatment as usual. Baseline differences, as well as response to treatment, were examined separately for alcohol and drug use and by gender. Although few baseline differences were found, hierarchical linear modeling indicated that alcohol and drug abusing male and female adolescents responded differently to therapy. Primary drug using males showed poorer alcohol use outcomes than did primary alcohol abusers. Specifically, alcohol use increased for primary drug using males receiving family therapy, while drug use decreased in all groups. Findings suggest that alcohol and drug use outcomes might be improved at treatment planning through consideration of client's gender and primary alcohol versus drug use.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Out-of-home care (OoHC) refers to young people removed from their families by the state because of abuse, neglect or other adversities. Many of the young people experience poor mental health and social function before, during and after leaving care. Rigorously evaluated interventions are urgently required. This publication describes the protocol for the Ripple project and notes early findings from a controlled trial demonstrating the feasibility of the work. The Ripple project is implementing and evaluating a complex mental health intervention that aims to strengthen the therapeutic capacities of carers and case managers of young people (12-17 years) in OoHC., METHODS: The study is conducted in partnership with mental health, substance abuse and social services in Melbourne, with young people as participants. It has three parts: 1. Needs assessment and implementation of a complex mental health intervention; 2. A 3-year controlled trial of the mental health, social and economic outcomes; and 3. Nested process evaluation of the intervention., RESULTS: Early findings characterising the young people, their carers and case managers and implementing the intervention are available. The trial Wave 1 includes interviews with 176 young people, 52% of those eligible in the study population, 104 carers and 79 case managers., CONCLUSIONS: Implementing and researching an affordable service system intervention appears feasible and likely to be applicable in other places and countries. Success of the intervention will potentially contribute to reducing mental ill-health among these young people, including suicide attempts, self-harm and substance abuse, as well as reducing homelessness, social isolation and contact with the criminal justice system., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12615000501549 .
