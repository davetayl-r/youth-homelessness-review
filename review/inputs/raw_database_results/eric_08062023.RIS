AB  - Risk factors associated with the likelihood of being sexually victimized by a stranger or friend/acquaintance since being on the street was examined among 372 homeless and runaway youth. Young people were interviewed on the streets and in shelters by outreach workers using a systematic sampling strategy. Youth who engaged in more high-risk behaviors were expected to be at greater risk for sexual victimization by both known and unknown assailants. Results indicated that for females, running from home for the first time at an earlier age was associated with sexual victimization by both a stranger and friend/acquaintance. However, engaging in deviant subsistence strategies, survival sex, and grooming predicted being sexually victimized by a friend/acquaintance. For males, survival sex and grooming predicted stranger sexual victimization, whereas sexual orientation was associated with sexual victimization by a friend/acquaintance. Overall,35% of the sample had been sexually victimized.

Found that girls who "run to" were younger, more impulsive, had internal locus of control, and had history of more runaways and longer periods of staying away from home. Girls who "run from" were older, more reflective, had external locus of control, and had history of fewer runaways and shorter periods away from home. (Author/NB)

AB  - This book describes experimental demonstration programs in the United States on different ways to link school and work more meaningfully for disadvantaged teenagers. The programs are sponsored by Youthwork, Incorporated, a public-private partnership concerned with youth unemployment and the transition from school to work. The book provides descriptions of program activities and includes first hand accounts of program experiences from project staff members and participants. The first two chapters of the book focus on efforts to serve groups of young people who are particularly hard to reach and difficult to serve successfully: youthful offenders, teenage parents, migrant youth, rural youth, underachievers, runaways, and the physically and mentally handicapped. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 highlight ways to link school and work through the involvement of such institutions as alternative schools, post-secondary institutions, and the private business sector. Chapters 6 and 7 describe approaches to getting good work placements and involving young people more deeply in programs designed to serve them. Chapter 8 reviews some projects that appear to have the potential for lasting impact on participants and identifies elements that may make programs more effective. Finally, chapter 9 examines how programs can be replicated in other areas around the country. An appendix provides a directory of the programs described in the report. (Author/MJL)

AB  - Psychiatric emergency services for children and adolescents vary in process, structure and outcome. There are few systematic studies on the type and prevalence of psychiatric problems encountered, related circumstances or resulting interventions. Evidence in these areas is important in evaluation of the function of mental health services in the relevant catchment area. This article presents a cohort study of 466 consecutive consultations that took place in the Amsterdam Child Psychiatric Emergency Service in 2008, with data on clinical, demographic and consultation-related characteristics. A majority of the consultations (51.5%) was related to behavioural problems in the context of heavily strained relationships. A total of 23.4% consultations were related to neglect or abuse. Parental mental illness prompted 12% of the consultations. Psychiatric diagnoses in the child as such were limited. The main "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" classification was a relational problem (70%). These crises were serious and often necessitated temporary placement. Hospitalisations on a psychiatric ward and/or pharmacological intervention were rare. Regular mental healthcare providers may specifically need to add psychiatric evaluation and treatment strategies when confronted with disruptive disorders. Additional preventive measures and firmer inter-agency collaboration may ameliorate the containment of problems in these children and their families. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - Background: Prior research reveals high unemployment rates among homeless young adults. The literature offers many examples of using evidence-based supported employment models with vulnerable populations to assist them in obtaining and maintaining competitive employment; yet few examples exist to date with homeless young adults with mental illness. Objective: The purpose of this study was thus to adapt an evidence-based intervention for adults with psychiatric illnesses [i.e., the Individual Placement and Support (IPS)] with homeless young adults with mental illness. Methods: Convenience sampling was used to recruit 20 homeless young adults (ages 18-24) with mental illness from the host agency. Participants received the IPS intervention over 10 months. A comparison sample was used at a separate agency of 16 homeless young adults with mental illness, who received standard agency services. Using a pre-post, self-comparison quasi-experimental design, the impact of the IPS was assessed on five employment outcomes: (1) ever-worked rate, (2) working-at-follow-up rate, (3) monthly work rate, (4) weekly work hours and (5) weekly income. Results: The IPS group was significantly more likely to have worked at some point over the 10-month study as well as to have worked a greater number of months overall. Conclusions: Findings provide greater insight into adapting, implementing and evaluating the IPS model with homeless young adults with mental illness. The study demonstrates that the IPS model is adaptable to work with homeless young adults with mental illness and is associated with successful retention and employment outcomes.

AB  - Although lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth with a history of homelessness (running away or being evicted from their homes by parents) report more psychological symptoms than homeless heterosexual peers, it is unclear whether symptoms are due to homelessness, given the absence of a non-homeless comparison group. This study longitudinally investigates whether LGB youth with a history of homelessness report more subsequent psychological symptoms than non-homeless LGB youth and examines potential mediators of any such relationships. Of the 156 LGB youth interviewed (49% female; 78% non-White), 48% reported past homeless experiences. Homelessness was associated with subsequent symptoms of anxiety, depression, conduct problems, and substance abuse and to changes in symptoms over time even after controlling for childhood sexual abuse and early development of sexual orientation. Stressful life events, negative social relationships, and social support from friends mediated the relationships between homelessness and symptomatology. These findings suggest the need for interventions to reduce stress and enhance social support among LGB youth with a history of homelessness in order to reduce psychological symptoms.

AB  - This study used the risk and resilience framework to examine predictors of formal and informal sources of income among homeless young adults. Formal sources of income generation consisted of full-time, part-time, or paid, temporary work. Informal sources included earning money from selling personal possessions, selling drugs, and theft. In all, 601 homeless young adults from three U.S. cities participated in semi-structured interviews. Structural equation modeling assessed whether demographic, homelessness history, mental health, problem behaviors, and resilience predicted income generation source. Income generation from formal sources was associated with being male, having a greater number of problem behaviors, and reporting higher levels of resilience. Informal income generation was associated with younger age, being transient, and reporting a greater number of problem behaviors. Findings underscore the need to address homelessness risk factors to support homeless young adults in securing stable, formal employment as an alternative to informal survival behaviors to earn income.

AB  - There are two factors that limit our knowledge of the risk factors associated with homelessness among runaway adolescents, namely (1) the samples used are often composed of youth homeless service users and/or youths living on the streets (visible homelessness), whereas most adolescents in fact use ''private'' resources (hidden homelessness), and (2) failure to use an adequate control group to identify risk factors associated specifically with homelessness. Our study compares the characteristics of two groups of youths under the supervision of the youth protection system, according to the presence or absence of periods of homelessness. The results throw light on the factors underlying the shift from ''at risk'' to ''homeless'', showing that youths with experience of homelessness are more likely to have been placed in substitute home environments, have experienced significant relationship difficulties with one of their parents (deterioration of the parent/youth relationship and parental abuse) and to have been diagnosed with behavioural disorders. The findings suggest that the decision to place young people under supervision is based more on the dynamic between risk factors rather than on the existence of behavioural problems.

AB  - Problem: Various demographic and familial risk factors have been linked to runaway behavior. To date, there has not been a systematic investigation of the impact of size of community on runaway behavior. This study will compare runaways from smaller cities and rural areas to their urban counterparts. Methods: A convenience sample of 602 adolescents was interviewed between 1995 and August of 1996 in Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas, USA. Multiple regression was used to examine the association between gender, neglect, sexual abuse, physical abuse, geographic and family structure change, and community size of first runaway to predict age at first runaway, deviant subsistence strategies, and street victimization. Results: Findings indicate that adolescents exposed to neglect (beta = -0.20) and sexual abuse (beta = -0.16) ran away sooner and were more likely to be victimized on the street. Rural adolescents who experienced higher levels of physical abuse relied more heavily on deviant subsistence strategies (beta = 0.15) and remained in abusive homes longer (beta = 0.15) than their similarly situated urban counterparts. Conclusions: Rural youth who have been subjected to elevated levels of familial abuse are at greater risk of deviant subsistence strategies, which increase the likelihood of street victimization.

AB  - This article aims to contribute to understandings of youth homelessness and subjectivity by analysing identity construction in terms of young people's negotiation of the structural and institutional environment of youth homelessness. I suggest that while existing literature on this topic concentrates mainly on micro-social encounters, the identities of young people experiencing homelessness can be understood as constructed by structural processes described by Ulrich Beck's individualisation thesis. Narratives from 20 Australian young people are analysed for how their identities are constructed in their contact with the institutions which govern youth homelessness, and the way these young people make sense of the structural conditions they are facing. Two narrative trajectories are identified. In narratives describing movement into homelessness, young people articulate feelings of failure and shame, consequences of their individualised understanding of their biography. In narratives describing movement out of homelessness into a home, young people articulate feelings of strength and pride, while also describing those who remain homeless in ways which reflect the status of homelessness as a stigmatised difference. This article concludes by discussing the way that structural, institutional and subjective processes interact to produce the identities of young people experiencing homelessness, and reflects on the utility of understanding youth homelessness as a form of individualised social inequality.

AB  - This study explored the gender differences in sexual self-concept, personal resources for sexual health, safe sex behaviors, and risky sexual behaviors among homeless adolescents with and without histories of sexual abuse. Data for this secondary analysis were collected in 2003 to 2004 in the first phase of a larger repeated-measures sexual health intervention study; 371 homeless youth between 16 and 23 years of age (M = 19.26, SD = 1.83) were recruited from a street outreach center. The majority (64.6%) of participants were males. Self-report instruments were completed at the outreach center via audio computer-assisted self-interview (A-CASI) format. It was found out that female participants were better off than males on numerous measures of sexual health behaviors and attitudes. Sexually abused participants had significantly less future time perspective (p = 0.05), fewer sexual self-care behaviors (p = 0.04), and less social support than nonabused participants (p = 0.01) and almost significantly more sexual risk-taking (p = 0.08). However, no significant differences were found between abused and nonabused participants on sexual self-concept, self-efficacy or intention to use condoms, safe sex behaviors, AIDS knowledge, assertive communication, or self-efficacy to perform testicular/breast self-exams. Overall, participants who did not report a history of sexual abuse had significantly more sexual health resources and engaged in fewer sex-risk behaviors than those who reported having been abused. These differences have notable implications for screening adolescents for a history of sexual abuse. Adolescents who report sexual abuse should receive risk counseling and be screened regularly for the development of sexual risk behaviors. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Objectives: Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) populations exhibit elevated rates of psychiatric disorders compared to heterosexuals, and these disparities emerge early in the life course. We examined the role of exposure to early-life victimization and adversity--including physical and sexual abuse, homelessness, and intimate partner violence--in explaining sexual orientation disparities in mental health among adolescents and young adults. Methods: Data were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, Wave 3 (2001-2002), a nationally representative survey of adolescents. Participants included gay/lesbian (n=227), bisexual (n=245), and heterosexual (n=13,490) youths, ages 18-27. We examined differences in the prevalence of exposure to child physical or sexual abuse, homelessness or expulsion from one's home by caregivers, and physical and sexual intimate partner violence according to sexual orientation. Next we examined the associations of these exposures with symptoms of psychopathology including suicidal ideation and attempts, depression, binge drinking, illicit drug use, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse. Finally, we determined whether exposure to victimization and adversity explained the association between sexual orientation and psychopathology. Results: Gay/lesbian and bisexual respondents had higher levels of psychopathology than heterosexuals across all outcomes. Gay/lesbian respondents had higher odds of exposure to child abuse and housing adversity, and bisexual respondents had higher odds of exposure to child abuse, housing adversity, and intimate partner violence, than heterosexuals. Greater exposure to these adversities explained between 10 and 20% of the relative excess of suicidality, depression, tobacco use, and symptoms of alcohol and drug abuse among LGB youths compared to heterosexuals. Exposure to victimization and adversity experiences in childhood and adolescence significantly mediated the association of both gay/lesbian and bisexual orientation with suicidality, depressive symptoms, tobacco use, and alcohol abuse. Conclusions: Exposure to victimization in early-life family and romantic relationships explains, in part, sexual orientation disparities in a wide range of mental health and substance use outcomes, highlighting novel targets for preventive interventions aimed at reducing these disparities.

AB  - The Learn and Earn to Achieve Potential (LEAP)™ initiative, a nationwide project of the Annie E. Casey Foundation, aims to improve education and employment outcomes for young people ages 15 to 25 who have been involved in the child welfare and justice systems or who are experiencing homelessness. Young people eligible for LEAP are likely to be disconnected from school and work, and face added challenges that stem directly from their systems involvement or homelessness, including disrupted schooling, housing instability, limited family support, and trauma. LEAP seeks to reduce the inequalities in life chances and outcomes that affect this population, with the goal of helping these young people reach their full potential by connecting them to postsecondary and career pathways. LEAP operationalizes two education- and employment-focused program models to help young people at different stages along their educational and employment pathways. One program, Jobs for America's Graduates, or JAG, targets young people who have not completed high school. JAG's goal is to help these individuals obtain a high school credential and to equip them with the work and life skills they need to land quality jobs or acquire a postsecondary education. The second, JFF's Back on Track program, aims to help young people transition to postsecondary education and persist through their crucial first year of college or advanced training. Ten grantees in eight states are implementing LEAP, each in multiple locations. This report presents implementation, outcomes, and cost research findings from MDRC's evaluation of the grantees' LEAP programs, which focused on the early years of the initiative. Four appendices are included in the report. [Numerous organizations sponsored this work and the full list can be seen in the document.]

AB  - Objective: To test the effectiveness of Houvast: a strengths-based intervention for homeless young adults. Method: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted with 10 Dutch shelter facilities randomly allocated to an intervention and a control group. Homeless young adults were interviewed when entering the facility and when care ended. Repeated-measures analyses and logistic regression analyses were conducted by the principle of intention-to-treat framework (N = 251). Results: Improvements were demonstrated on quality of life; satisfaction with family relations, finances, and health; employed or in school; depression; care needs; autonomy; competence, and resilience in both conditions. A higher proportion of homeless young adults who received care according to Houvast were still receiving care at follow-up and successfully completed the trajectory compared to those who received care as usual. Conclusion: Homeless young adults seem to benefit from service provision in general. Further research on the effectiveness of Houvast is needed after sufficient model fidelity has been achieved.

AB  - Research nationally demonstrates that children and youth experiencing foster care and/or homelessness achieve academic outcomes significantly below their peers due to trauma and loss, multiple changes in homes and schools, and emotional upheaval. When youth fail to graduate from high school, they are much more likely to live in poverty, require public assistance, experience adult homelessness, and be incarcerated. For the class of 2015, only 41.5% of Washington State youth in foster care and only 38.4% of youth who have experienced homelessness graduated high school on time. A coalition of state agencies and nonprofit organizations began meeting about strategies to improve outcomes in October 2017. A 2018 budget proviso (Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 6032) codified their charge, directing the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF), in collaboration with the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI), the Office of Homeless Youth (OHY), and the Washington Student Achievement Council (WSAC), to convene a workgroup with aligned nonprofit organizations to: Create a plan for children and youth experiencing foster care and homelessness to facilitate educational equity with their general student population peers and to close the disparities between racial and ethnic groups by 2027. The Project Education Impact workgroup -- has convened over the past year to advance solutions, including recommending changes to the systems that prevent children and youth from being successful in school. As a result of extensive collaboration and feedback, the Project Education Impact workgroup developed some high-level recommendations for Washington State to achieve the 2027 goal. Those goals are detailed in this report, and include: (1) Making ample investments to support the educational success of children and youth experiencing foster care and/or homelessness; (2) Alignment, coordination, and monitoring policy, services, resources and outcomes to ensure academic success for students experiencing foster care and/or homelessness statewide; and (3) Leveraging data to inform real time, individualized education supports for students as well as longitudinal analysis of education outcomes. In order to maximize impact the recommended immediate next steps for Project Education Impact include: (1) Expanding workgroup to include meaningful partnership with tribal governments, the courts, homeless service providers, and other key stakeholders; (2) Pursuing key policy changes and state investments during upcoming legislative sessions; (3) Convening data sharing subgroup to identify and resolve barriers to public reporting of educational outcomes; and (4) Convening the workgroup to develop mid-term and long-term objectives, review updated educational outcomes, adjust plans, and update key stakeholders and the Legislature by December 31, 2019. [Other Washington State Agencies participating in Project Education Impact include: Washington Department of Commerce's Office of Homeless Youth Prevention and Protection and the Washington State Department of Social & Health Services' Office of Refugee & Immigrant Services (DSHS). Non profit agencies participating in Project Education Impact include: Building Changes, College Success Foundation, Equity in Education Coalition, The Mockingbird Society, and Treehouse.]

AB  - This study examines prostitution, homelessness, delinquency and crime, and school problems as potential mediators of the relationship between childhood abuse and neglect (CAN) and illicit drug use in middle adulthood. Children with documented cases of physical and sexual abuse and neglect (ages 0-11) during 1967-1971 were matched with non-maltreated children and followed into middle adulthood (approximate age 39). Mediators were assessed in young adulthood (approximate age 29) through in-person interviews between 1989 and 1995 and official arrest records through 1994 (N = 1,196). Drug use was assessed via self-reports of past year use of marijuana, psychedelics, cocaine, and/or heroin during 2000-2002 (N = 896). Latent variable structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test: (1) a four-factor model with separate pathways from CAN to illicit drug use through each of the mediating risk factors and (2) a second-order model with a single mediating risk factor comprised of prostitution, homelessness, delinquency and crime, and poor school performance. Analyses were performed separately for women and men, controlling for race/ethnicity and early drug use. In the four-factor model for both men and women, CAN was significantly related to each of the mediators, but no paths from the mediators to drug use were significant. For women, the second-order risk factor mediated the relationship between CAN and illicit drug use in middle adulthood. For men, neither child abuse and neglect nor the second-order risk factor predicted drug use in middle adulthood. These results suggest that for women, the path from CAN to middle adulthood drug use is part of a general "problem behavior syndrome" evident earlier in life.

AB  - This guide shows how "Foyers" (safe residences for working/learning youth) and other organizations provide routes back into learning for young people. Chapter 1, "Young People and the Current Learning Agenda," provides a summary of encouraging developments from government, ushering in new learning opportunities for young people. Chapter 2, "Turning Young People Back on to Learning," presents findings from interviews and group discussions to test for differences in attitude between genders and younger people and young adults. These findings show how learning fits into these groups' worlds and focus on their principal interests and concerns; attitudes to learning; motivations to learn; barriers to learning; overcoming barriers; and learning role models. Chapter 3, "The Foyer Movement," describes the Foyer Federation and how Foyers work. Chapter 4, "Learning from Experience," draws seven case studies from selected Foyers and seven from other organizations working with disenchanted young people. These keys to tackling problems are discussed: time and care, learner involvement, overcoming negative experiences, making it fun, motivation, support and staff, positive learning experiences, holistic approach, paying the bills, managing success, and making partnerships work. Case studies of 12 individuals are included, and a brief resume of each project is found at the end of the chapter. Chapter 5, "Joined-Up Learning," lists key learning points and recommends action to address the issue. (YLB)

Propensity score matching was conducted in estimating the effect of running away on high school dropout while controlling for confounding factors, such as familial instability and socioemotional health risks. The findings suggest that having runaway-homeless episodes have a detrimental effect on academic achievement.

AB  - Youth involved in both the child welfare and juvenile justice systems--a specific high-needs population--often experience a host of negative outcomes beyond those experienced by their peers involved in only one (or neither) system. These outcomes include higher rates of homelessness, mental health problems, and joblessness. These "dually involved" youth are also more likely to engage in both nonviolent (such as stealing) and violent (such as fighting) delinquent or criminal behaviors in adolescence and young adulthood. Such behaviors, along with childhood experiences of abuse and neglect (or maltreatment), can impact the well-being of these youth and their ability to become self-sufficient adults. With this in mind, two essential factors can help identify policy and practice solutions: an understanding of the relationship between child maltreatment and delinquent or criminal behavior, and of whether certain protective factors may buffer youth from engaging in these behaviors. In this report, we examine--in the general population--the relationship between self-reported experiences of child maltreatment and later delinquent or criminal behaviors across age, sex, race, and sexual orientation. By studying this relationship in the general population, our intent is to glean lessons for offering better support to dual-system youth, and to provide insights for the field as it strives to develop and refine preventative approaches to ensure that young people do not initially enter the justice system. To do this, we also explore a variety of protective factors--at the peer, family, school, and neighborhood levels--to test whether these factors decrease delinquent or criminal behaviors and whether those protective effects differ across sex, race and ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Key Findings: (1) Some protective factors were helpful for all youth--not just those who experienced maltreatment; (2) Some protective factors were especially helpful for youth who had experienced maltreatment; and (3) Protective factors benefit all youth, regardless of individual characteristics. Adolescents who engage in delinquent or criminal behavior are often labeled "problem children" or "delinquents," and are often described as beyond redemption. However, our research suggests that many young people involved in the juvenile justice system are struggling with the effects and trauma of earlier maltreatment. The findings also suggest strategies that can potentially support youth who have experienced maltreatment to engage in more pro-social behaviors. Specifically, increasing the quality of these youths' connections to their families, schools, and communities can reduce their engagement in criminal behavior, and may reduce recidivism after initial problem behaviors are identified. Young men are particularly at risk for subsequent behavioral issues, signaling a need for additional support.

AB  - Monarch School is a San Diego-based public K-12 institution that exclusively serves homeless students. Begun by the San Diego County Office of Education as a drop-in center for homeless high school students, the 170-student school is now a public-private partnership between the San Diego school board and the nonprofit Monarch School Project. The school is one of a small number of schools across the country that specifically serve students affected by unstable housing conditions. Those schools, along with other schools nationwide, are seeing a growing number of students who are homeless. Experts say the recent recession has exacerbated youth homelessness, and schools serving this vulnerable population are now being challenged to keep up with the rising numbers of students and offer the unique services to which they are entitled under federal law. The San Diego area has been hit especially hard economically. According to the San Diego County Office of Education, there were 13,204 homeless students countywide during the 2009-2010 academic year. Monarch School has seen a 74 percent increase in enrollment in the past three years. While the school never turns away its students, the school has outgrown its current space. This summer, it will begin work on a new building in which school officials hope to serve about 350 students. The school does not recruit students--most of its families learn about it by word of mouth or through social-service referrals, usually while living in shelters. In nearby Arizona, Children First Academy, Phoenix Campus, another school serving homeless students, has seen its waiting list grow. Enrollment in this K-8 school has increased by 12 percent to 18 percent in the past three years. Because the homeless student population is transient, the school's average enrollment fluctuates between 280 and 320 students, its maximum capacity. During the 2009-2010 academic year, the school's waiting list had about 12 students. This month, it has 60 students.

AB  - In a qualitative study, 302 homeless young people (aged 12 to 20 years) were asked to discuss their reasons for leaving home. Some 103 youth cited physical violence by a parent or stepparent, and of these, 39 cited their mother's or stepmother's violence as the reason for leaving home. Females were more likely than males to report being the target of violence by their mother; however, the converse was true for stepmothers. Several discrete reasons for maternal violence were identified, including maternal personal characteristics and behaviors, issues associated with blended families, or young people's own behavior. In some cases, young people reported violence by both parents. Their attributions of maternal violence centered on a single dimension of the mother/stepmother or her relationship with a partner. They rarely discussed the contribution that they had made to the conflict or acknowledged the social context that may have been a catalyst for violence.

AB  - Adolescence is a developmental period during which many youth experiment with risk practices. This paper examined the association of parental monitoring with a range of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use behaviors among high-risk youth, while controlling for other demographic and environmental variables previously found to be associated with AOD use. Participants were recruited as part of a longitudinal evaluation study of four youth drop-in centers located in Southern California. These centers served at-risk youth, including Hispanic, Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Questioning (LGBQ), and homeless and runaway youth. Participants were aged 14 to 24 and were new attendees at the drop-in centers. Results from logistic regression analyses revealed that while controlling for demographic and environmental variables, adolescents who reported less parental monitoring were more likely to report lifetime use of cigarettes, marijuana, and methamphetamine, and in the past three months, use of alcohol and binge drinking. The findings thus indicate that, even among high-risk youth, those who reported low parental monitoring were significantly more likely to use a variety of substances. Implications of these findings are discussed as they pertain to AOD prevention and interventions for children and their families.

AB  - Major strides have been made in the field of youth development. However, youth transitioning into adulthood have not received similar attention. These older youth have frequently been overlooked by policymakers and practitioners who have been more focused on designing programs and services for adolescents and young children. Because older youth face a unique set of challenges and risks as they move into adulthood, it is important to identify intervention strategies that can enhance the development and success of these individuals in domains such as employment, independent living, drug and alcohol use, pregnancy, parenting, life skills, mental health, release from the foster care system, homelessness, violence, education, and literacy. This synthesis examines the role that programs designed to serve older youth can play in promoting positive development and subsequent self-sufficiency in adulthood. The authors synthesize the findings from 31 studies that implemented random assignment intent-to-treat experimental evaluations to examine the impacts of various intervention strategies on youth well-being outcomes during the transition to adulthood (ages 18 to 25). While all programs evaluated outcomes for these "emerging adults," programs varied in the ages of targeted youth: 10 programs targeted youth from as early as 12 years and into their early twenties; eight programs served youth from 16 years and into their early twenties; and 11 programs began at 18 years of age. This review of experimental evaluations indicates that education and career programs can be effective, especially for low income youth and for youth targeted from younger ages, for example, those under age 18. Furthermore, specific intervention strategies, such as mentoring, case management, and providing child care for young parents, are associated with program success across outcomes. However, existing substance use and reproductive health programs have not consistently been found to be effective across outcomes for this age group. (Contains 1 footnote and 11 endnotes.)

AB  - Interviews were conducted with 712 Canadian street youth (ages 15-20 years) to assess their knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors with regard to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Youth were interviewed in 10 cities across Canada on the basis of 5 street culture lifestyles: prostitution, drug abuse, homelessness, criminal behavior, and preparation for employment. The study results confirmed that street youth were a vulnerable group of young people whose lifestyles placed them at high risk for the contraction and transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other STDs. Respondents reported heavy drug use which may increase their vulnerability to HIV infection. Most respondents reported being sexually active and the majority reported having multiple sexual partners and engaging in sexual experimentation. The first chapter of this report provides an introduction to the study. Chapter II examines family background, school experience, relationships with parents, self-esteem, and mental health of the street youth. Chapter III illustrates the vulnerable lifestyles of the youth, chapter IV looks at their knowledge and sources of information about AIDS and other STDs, and chapter V considers the attitudes of these street youth toward AIDS and STDs. Chapter VI reports on the risk-taking behaviors of street youth related to HIV and other STDs, and the seventh and final chapter reviews key findings and makes recommendations to meet the needs of street youth and to prevent the spread of HIV. Numerous tables and figures are included, and the text is illustrated with black and white photographs. (NB)

AB  - Support for the extended care provisions of the federal Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 was, to a large extent, based on the belief that allowing youth in foster care to remain in care past their 18th birthday would improve their outcomes as adults. In a previous memo (see ED597309), the authors reported early findings on the relationships between the amount of time youth remained in extended foster care (EFC) and host of youth outcomes. These early findings from CalYOUTH were in line with results from prior studies that found EFC promoted educational attainment, increased earnings, and decreased instances of homelessness and criminal justice system involvement (Courtney & Hook, 2017; Dworsky, Napolitano, & Courtney, 2013; Hook & Courtney, 2011; Lee, Courtney, & Tajima, 2014). This report builds on the authors' 2017 memo by examining outcomes from the third CalYOUTH interview wave, which took place when participants were 21 years old, on average, and had all left foster care. The report also incorporates another data source--state administrative data on a large sample of transition-age foster youth in California. These administrative data include youth who reached the age of majority while in care both before and after the 2012 implementation of California's law extending foster care to young adults, the California Fostering Connections Act, also known as AB12. Taken together, study findings reported in this study provide additional evidence about the benefits of extended care on outcomes for youth transitioning to adulthood from foster care.

AB  - Objective: To examine family risk factors associated with dissociative symptoms among homeless and runaway youth. Method: Three hundred and twenty-eight homeless and runaway youth were interviewed using a systematic sampling strategy in metropolitan Seattle. Homeless young people were interviewed on the streets and in shelters by outreach workers in youth service agencies. Results: The current study revealed widespread prevalence of dissociative symptoms among these young people. Multivariate analyses revealed that sexual abuse, physical abuse, and family mental health problems were all positively associated with dissociative symptoms. No gender differences were found for any of the models. Conclusions: Dissociative behavior is widespread among these youth and may pose a serious mental health concern. Some young people experience numerous stressors, and with few resources and little support available, many may invoke maladaptive strategies such as dissociative behavior to handle such situations, which may in turn be detrimental to their mental health. Unless youth are provided with programs and intervention, the cycle of abuse that they have experienced at home is likely to continue on the street.

MDRC researchers worked with a group of youth fellows in Learn and Earn to Achieve Potential, an Annie E. Casey Foundation project for young people ages 14 to 25 who have been involved in the child welfare or justice systems or who have experienced homelessness. This brief describes the benefits of the collaboration to the research process, strategies used by the researchers to structure the collaboration, and the challenges they encountered.

AB  - Runaway and homeless youth often have a constellation of background behavioral, emotional, and familial problems that contribute to stress and maladaptive behaviors, which, in turn, can lead to self-harming and suicidal behaviors. The current study examined the roles of stress and maladaptive behaviors as mediators between demographic and psychosocial background characteristics and self-injurious outcomes through the lens of the stress process paradigm. The model was tested in a sample of runaway and homeless youth from Los Angeles County (N = 474, age 12-24, 41% female, 17% White, 32.5% African American, 21.5% Hispanic/Latino). Background variables (gender, age, sexual minority status, parental drug use history, and emotional distress) predicted hypothesized mediators of maladaptive behaviors and recent stress. In turn, it was hypothesized that the mediators would predict self-harming behaviors and suicide attempts in the last 3 months. Females and LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) youth were more likely to have self-harmed and attempted suicide; younger participants reported more self-harming. The mediating constructs were associated more highly with self-harming than suicide attempts bivariately, although differences were modest. Maladaptive behaviors and recent stress were significant predictors of self-harm, whereas only recent stress was a significant predictor of suicide attempts. All background factors were significant predictors of recent stress. Older age, a history of parental drug use, and greater emotional distress predicted problem drug use. Males, younger participants, and participants with emotional distress reported more delinquent behaviors. Significant indirect effects on self-harming behaviors were mediated through stress and maladaptive behaviors. The hypothesized paradigm was useful in explaining the associations among background factors and self-injurious outcomes and the influence of mediating factors on these associations.

AB  - This study examines the factors influencing runaway experiences among at-risk youth. Using the data of 1,743 at-risk youth from the 2016 survey of Korean adolescents' contact with media usage and harmful environment, a logistic regression analysis was conducted. This study shows that factors associated with the adolescents' experiences of family relationships, violence victimization, and harmful environment influence the occurrence of runaway behavior in at-risk adolescents. A significant outcome of this study is the identification of a harmful environment as a factor affecting runaway behavior. The factors identified need to be considered in the development of prevention programs targeting runway behavior among at-risk youth. School nurses are uniquely positioned to review and revise educational strategies to raise adolescents' awareness regarding the effects of harmful environments and to promote violence prevention. This framework provides school nurses with systematic methods for early identification and management of risk factors among at-risk youth runway behavior.

AB  - For more than 25 years, Advocates for Children of New Jersey (ACNJ) has produced the New Jersey KIDS COUNT Data Book, an annual statewide profile of child well-being. With KIDS COUNT represented in each state and several U.S. territories, ACNJ is part of a comprehensive effort to not only track how well kids are faring across New Jersey, but also on a national level. Funded by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, KIDS COUNT informs policymakers and the public of the progress made and work needed to ensure the health, welfare and safety of all children. This year's data book features a new layout with explanations of specific indicators, as well as updates on how certain information is collected and measured. Each year ACNJ tries to incorporate new indicators of child well-being based on suggestions from its network or new data sources that become available. ACNJ obtains data primarily from state departments and agencies, but much of the demographic information is obtained through the U.S. Census, American Community Survey (ACS). While the census counts basic information every ten years, the ACS provides a richer data set every year which includes age, disability status, housing condition, ancestry, education level, race/ethnicity and marital and family status.

AB  - We assessed the feasibility of ecological momentary assessment using short message service (SMS) surveying with 150 homeless youth. We found that on average, participants completed 18.8 days of texts, but 30% of youth (N = 44) had texting data on 28 or more days. The average number of texts answered per day was 8.49 (of a possible 11). Forty-three percent of days had answers to all 11 texts sent that day, and 69.4% of days had answers to eight or more texts. We found significant differences in response rates by phone type. Seventy-three percent of youth reported that responding to our texts was very easy or somewhat easy and 69% endorsed the response option "just enough," regarding the number of texts sent per day. The 30-day texting period was deemed "about right" by 74% of youth. Details of using SMS with homeless youth are provided, and results indicate that this data collection technique is feasible with this population.

AB  - The transition to adulthood is an underresearched topic for cross-systems youth, defined as young people who have experienced homelessness, child welfare system involvement, and educational challenges. This qualitative study explored processes of resilience in the transition to adulthood for cross-systems youth aged 18 to 24 (n = 20). Analysis of in-depth interviews using a grounded theory open coding process revealed two thematic concepts, striving and dreaming. As illustrated in two case studies, striving was characterized by participants having specific educational and career goals and making strategic choices about programs and resources. In contrast, the dreaming concept indicated participants having little understanding of the steps and resources needed to achieve their goals. Implications for practice include the importance of helping cross-systems youth maintain supportive relationships with families of origin and peers to enhance striving, and the use of motivational interviewing to assist emerging adults in gauging their readiness and motivation to set and pursue goals.

AB  - Runaway behaviors among teenagers have been studied for some 40 years. Still, because runaway and homeless youths have often been confounded, little is known about what really defines a runaway adolescent. This study targets three objectives in a mixed-method design relying on data from official files and interviews: the descriptions of teenagers reported as missing (e.g., age, sex, runaway duration and reiteration, place left behind, type of caller reporting the child as missing, motivation for closing the file) and the understanding of runaway pathways and dynamics. These studies can contribute to prevention and intervention programs by providing new perspectives on how runaway experiences should be understood in light of the adolescent process.

AB  - The McKinney-Vento Homeless Education Assistance Improvements Act of 2001 (MCKV), which provides funds to local educational agencies (LEAs), is almost a decade old, yet no evaluations of its academic effectiveness have been reported. Using a systems theory framework, the authors answer the question of whether homeless students in grade 6 from LEAs that received MCKV funding scored better in reading comprehension and mathematics on end-of-grade (EOG) test scores than did those from LEAs that did not receive MCKV funding. Data from 2006 and 2007 were provided by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. About 20 percent of the state's LEAs received MCKV grants, which created a treatment group (funded LEAs) and a control group (nonfunded LEAs). Using untreated control group designs with matched pretests (grade 5 EOG test scores) and posttests (grade 6 EOG test scores), 2 x 2 analyses of variance with repeated measures failed to reject the null hypotheses. The authors did not support the hypotheses that MCKV grants improved the academic achievement of homeless students. There was no significant difference in the funded and nonfunded EOG test scores.

AB  - This research investigates changes in social network size and composition of 351 homeless adolescents over 3 years. Findings show that network size decreases over time. Homeless youth with a conduct disorder begin street life with small networks that remain small over time. Caregiver abuse is associated with smaller emotional networks due to fewer "home" ties, especially to parents, and a more rapid loss of emotional "home" ties over time. Homeless youth with major depression start out with small networks, but are more likely to "maintain" network ties. Youth with substance abuse problems are more likely to "maintain" instrumental "home" ties. Finally, homeless adolescents tend to reconnect with their parents for instrumental aid and form romantic relationship that provide emotional support.

AB  - The Bridge, Inc.'s Independent Living Demonstration Project, a residential project assisting 16- and 17-year-old runaways and throwaways to live successfully on their own after receiving 6-8 months of project services, served 10 male and 12 female adolescents during its second year of operation. Youth were from high, middle, and lower income families; 50 percent were runaways and 41 percent were throwaways. Over one-third had been physically or sexually abused by their families and another one-third had been neglected. Status of 11 youth who had been out of the project an average of 5.7 months showed that project youth had statistically significantly better records in achieving employment and stable living situations compared to 18 control group youth receiving other types of services. Project youth also had school achievements showing a trend in the direction of significance. Pre-post means on measures of self-concept, locus of control, and a personality profile did not show significant change. A concurrent follow-up of the first year youth who had been out of the project an average of 15.9 months revealed that these youth continued to maintain a strong record of success: 81.8 percent were in stable living situations; 81.8 percent were employed; and 90.9 percent were in school or had graduated from high school. The results suggest that the Bridge, Inc. Residential Independent Living Demonstration Project has shown marked success in assisting runaways and homeless youth to achieve employment, stable living situations, and educational progress. (NB)

AB  - This Research-to-Impact brief is the fifth in a series by Chapin Hall's Voices of Youth Count on understanding and addressing youth homelessness. The brief estimates that nearly 4.2 million youth and young adults in America experienced some form of homelessness during a 12-month period. It highlights research related to the specific experiences of young people who reside in the vast areas of the country that have fewer people and more widely dispersed services. The findings show that rural youth homelessness is just as prevalent as homelessness in urban areas. However, in rural areas, youth experiences of homelessness are more likely to be hidden, and these youth face unique challenges accessing education, jobs, services, and support.

AB  - Background: While some recent research has addressed homeless youth from a strengths-based approach, comparative studies of homeless and non-homeless youth from a strengths perspective are few; research that includes youth's views on positive youth development are also limited. Objective: Addressing these gaps and using an inductive approach, adolescents' views on positive development and their strengths were solicited. This study investigated the qualitative differences in views on doing well, strengths and positive development from two youth samples: youth who were homeless and resident youth involved in a 4-H program. Methods: Thirty-eight adolescents participated in focus groups, including five groups from a homeless shelter and five groups from a 4-H program. Content analysis of the narrative responses was conducted. Results: Differences between homeless and 4-H adolescents were found in the areas of happiness, family support, identity, personal strengths, and risk avoidance. Homeless youth revealed adaptation to limiting ecologies (e.g., non-supportive parents) as they sought out other supportive relationships instead and adjusted their views of happiness. Homeless adolescents demonstrated more internal self-awareness compared to 4-H adolescents. Conclusions: By recognizing and capitalizing on the unique perspectives and strengths of adolescents from divergent environments, positive youth development and strengths-based programs and theory can more effectively benefit youth from diverse backgrounds. Understanding youth's views that have normative and non-normative experiences (i.e., non-homeless and homeless) helps further expand the boundaries of developmental models and address how to promote thriving in youth from various contexts.

AB  - Four-week summer academy programs served homeless children and adults in two contiguous innovative learning programs. The programs may be the first of their kind in the homeless literature in which both adults and children were exposed to career, academic, and leadership opportunities in the supportive learning environment of a university campus, and where academy children's academic and self-perception results were compared with matched controls. Children experienced literacy instruction, a mathematics board game, robotics, leadership training, tennis instruction on court facilities, and computer, biology, and chemistry at respective laboratory sites. Adults participated in writing workshop, computer, health and self-care, urban economic, counseling, career, and yoga sessions. Academy children did not experience gains in norm-referenced vocabulary, spelling, or behavioural tests, but did demonstrate highly significant gains in writing ability based on state rubric criteria when compared with controls. In addition, they significantly increased in vocabulary understanding based on eight books read and in tennis skills. Adults significantly increased in keyboarding fluency based on their computer training.

AB  - "YouthBuild" offers low-income youth both education and job training services. "YouthBuild's" education component emphasizes attaining a GED or high school diploma, typically in alternative schools with small class sizes and an emphasis on individualized instruction. In "YouthBuild's" job-training program, participants work in construction jobs building affordable housing for low-income and homeless people in their communities. "YouthBuild" is targeted to youth between the ages of 16 and 24 who are from low-income families and who have demonstrated educational need, typically by being high school dropouts. Participants spend six months to two years in the program. During this time, they alternate weeks between being full-time students and working full-time in the job-training program. Throughout the program, youth participate in counseling, peer support groups, and life-planning exercises that are intended to encourage them to overcome negative habits and pursue life goals. "YouthBuild" programs are typically sponsored by community- or faith-based organizations. These programs are linked by a centralized national office that provides implementation support to local "YouthBuild" sites, such as staff training and information on best practices and program innovations. The WWC identified 32 studies of YouthBuild that were published or released between 1996 and 2009. No studies of "YouthBuild" that fall within the scope of the Dropout Prevention review protocol meet What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) evidence standards. The lack of studies meeting WWC evidence standards means that, at this time, the WWC is unable to draw any conclusions based on research about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of "YouthBuild."

AB  - This study identified predictors of transience among homeless emerging adults in three cities. A total of 601 homeless emerging adults from Los Angeles, Austin, and Denver were recruited using purposive sampling. Ordinary least squares regression results revealed that significant predictors of greater transience include White ethnicity, high school degree or equivalent, homeless residence in the 6 months prior to the study, longer period of homelessness, history of arrest and juvenile detention, earning income through informal sources, history of physical abuse, alcohol/drug addiction, and resilience characteristics. Quantitative findings were expanded upon with data from in-depth interviews with 145 of these homeless emerging adults regarding their reasons and motivations for transience. Identifying predictors of transience will facilitate customizing interventions that, when needed, aim to stabilize homeless emerging adults, prevent their mobility, and/or offer mobile services to them on the road.

AB  - This Research-to-Impact brief is the first in a series by Chapin Hall's Voices of Youth Count on understanding and addressing youth homelessness. "Missed Opportunities: National Estimates" highlights results from a national survey on unaccompanied youth homelessness in America. The study captures youth homelessness broadly, including sleeping on the streets, in shelters, running away, being kicked out, and couch surfing. Overall, findings show one in 10 young adults ages 18-25, and at least one in 30 adolescents ages 13-17, experience some form of homelessness unaccompanied by a parent or guardian over the course of a year. As a nation, we are missing opportunities to ensure that all young people can reach their full potential and contribute to stronger communities and economies across the country.

AB  - This Research-to-Impact brief is the sixth in a series by Chapin Hall's Voices of Youth Count on understanding and addressing youth homelessness. This brief draws exclusively on the in-depth interview (IDI) component from Voices of Youth Count. The 215 young people that were interviewed across five diverse U.S. counties shared stories of instability--their pathways through homelessness--that highlighted missed opportunities for prevention and intervention. Insights point to critical areas for improvement: (1) the need for multilevel supports for individuals and families; (2) the importance of peers for building connections to trustworthy spaces and resources; and (3) the identification of specific changes that need to be made to service systems. This brief centers upon the insights and perspectives of young people whose contributions to society are profoundly inhibited. Their lives are needlessly constrained by the many opportunities we miss for protecting and fostering their healthy development and well-being. Findings support the unquestionable urgency of meeting the needs of young people for permanent housing and safety. These findings also emphasize that this period of time is developmentally significant and, therefore, developmental awareness must directly inform any strategy for addressing homelessness. These youths' stories highlight the consequences of chronic interpersonal trauma and loss, and the critical importance of safe emergency shelters and transitional housing. Their stories also show the urgent need to help youth and their families heal the adversity and trauma that preceded and persisted throughout their unaccompanied homelessness. The brief elevates the voices of youth as a call to adults to rethink and redouble their efforts in ending youth homelessness. Several key findings include: (1) Young people link the beginning of their homelessness to earlier disruptions of family and home, including family homelessness and entrance into foster care; (2) Young people name multilevel factors--critical conditions--that shaped how pathways through homelessness unfolded; and (3) Youth pathways through homelessness are also characterized by significant personal losses; 35% of youth experienced the death of at least one parent or primary caregiver. In addition to outlining the findings, this brief then connects those findings to recommended revisions to the federal Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, which authorizes community-based temporary shelter and care, and specifically targets services for minors. Revising the Act is likely to offer the most direct means to impact the programs and services that are intended to support young people like those who were interviewed. Beyond the recommendations, additional opportunities for change will likely expand outward to include other statutes and multiple federal agencies and program areas.

AB  - Client satisfaction surveys give clients a voice in the planning and management of services. While their use is quite widespread, they have hardly at all been used in the evaluation of shelters for homeless youths. In this article, the authors present findings of a client satisfaction survey conducted among residents of a shelter for homeless youths in Tel Aviv, Israel, shortly after their departure from the shelter. Satisfaction was affected mainly by three aspects of life in the shelter--the staff, the food, and the other residents. Satisfaction was related to adjustment to the shelter but not to outcomes. The survey highlights the potential and limitations of client satisfaction surveys with young persons in distress. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - A federally-funded research project for the Bridge Independent Living Project was designed to determine whether this structured residential program would have significant impact on the lives of 16- and 17-year-old homeless youth as compared to a similar control group. A non-equivalent control group design was employed in which youth referred to the independent living project were assessed on several personality dimensions before entering the program and at a 6-14 month follow-up. Instruments used were the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, the Lanyon Psychological Screening Inventory, and the Rotter Locus of Control Scale. Data were also collected on education and employment status, living situation, and behavior problems. Control youth from whom the same data were collected received other services from Bridge including counseling, General Educational Development, and vocational programs, but were living at home, with friends, or in other residential programs. Demographic data and entry assessment information were collected on 21 program and 36 control youth. One year follow-up data were available for 12 program and 18 control youth. At follow-up, program youth showed statistically significant gains in self-concept and became significantly less defensive than control youth. There was a trend in program youth toward less alienation or emotional problems compared to control youth, but no significant changes in sense of personal control for program youth. Program youth were found to be significantly more often employed and in school or had obtained a high school diploma, and were significantly more often in stable living situations than were control youth. Numerous tables and the survey forms are included. (NB)

AB  - Support for the extended care provisions of the federal Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 was, to a large extent, based on the belief that allowing youth in foster care to remain in care past their 18th birthday would improve their outcomes as adults. Research following foster youth into adulthood has shown that they generally fare much worse than their age peers in terms of educational attainment, employment and earnings, homelessness and economic hardship, health and mental health, early pregnancy and parenting, victimization, and criminal justice system involvement. This brief provides an early look at the relationship between extended foster care and selected outcomes for youth transitioning to adulthood from care in California. Examining outcomes observed when young people participating in the California Youth Transitions to Adulthood Study (CalYOUTH) were nineteen years old, the authors find evidence that remaining in extended care is associated with a number of benefits for young adults.

AB  - Travelers are a migratory subgroup of homeless youth who may be especially prone to engaging in risky behavior. This study compared the substance use and sexual behavior of young homeless travelers and non-travelers to evaluate the extent and possible sources of travelers' increased risk. Data came from face-to-face interviews with 419 homeless youth (36.6% female, 34.0% white, 23.9% African American, and 20.0% Hispanic) between the ages of 13 and 24 years (M = 20.1 years, SD = 2.5) who were randomly sampled from 41 shelters, drop-in centers, and street sites in Los Angeles. Travelers were almost twice as likely as non-travelers to exhibit recent heavy drinking, 37% more likely to exhibit recent marijuana use, and five times as likely to have injected drugs. Travelers also had more recent sex partners and were more likely to report having casual or need-based sexual partners and combining sex with substance use. Mediation analyses suggest that travelers' deviant peer associations and disconnection to conventional individuals and institutions may drive their elevated substance use. Differences in sexual risk behaviors are likely attributable to demographic differences between the two groups. Overall, these differences between travelers and non-travelers suggest different service needs and the need for different service approaches. (Contains 7 tables.)

AB  - Currently, there are more than 1.35 million children and youth experiencing homelessness enrolled in schools across the nation. Students experiencing homelessness are more likely to suffer academically and are less likely to finish school when compared to their housed peers. Homeless students are less likely to engage in school, more likely to have higher absentee rates, and more likely to have lower test scores. The federal McKinney-Vento Act broadly defines homelessness in an effort to provide supports for students living in a variety of unstable housing situations; thus ensuring school stability and continued enrollment at a time when a student's nighttime residence may be constantly changing. In 2001, the McKinney-Vento Act began requiring all school districts to annually report the number of students experiencing homelessness enrolled in their schools. These reports show school districts have reported increased numbers of students experiencing homelessness every year since then. During the 2017-18 school year, 40,365 students were identified as homeless, which amounted to 3.4 percent of students statewide. This report provides next steps for Washington as well as data on homeless student enrollment, academic outcomes and graduation rates.

AB  - Existing research suggests that sexual minority youth experience lower levels of well-being, in part because they perceive less social support than heterosexual youth. Sexual minority youth with strong family relationships may demonstrate resilience and increased well-being; however, it is also possible that the experience of sexual stigma may make these relationships less protective for sexual minority youth. Using two waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we explore the links between same-sex attraction, family relationships, and adolescent well-being in a sample of over 13,000 7th-12th grade adolescents (51% female, 52% non-Latino/a white, 17% Latino, 21% African American, and 7% Asian). Specifically, we examine whether lower levels of parental closeness, parental involvement, and family support among same-sex attracted youth explain in part why these youth experience increased depressive symptoms and risk behaviors, including binge drinking, illegal drug use, and running away from home, relative to other-sex attracted youth. Second, we ask whether family relationships are equally protective against depressive symptoms and risk behaviors for same-sex attracted and other-sex attracted youth. We find that same-sex attracted youth, particularly girls, report higher levels of depressive symptoms, binge drinking, and drug use in part because they perceive less closeness with parents and less support from their families. Results also suggest that parental closeness and parental involvement may be less protective against risk behaviors for same-sex attracted boys than for their other-sex attracted peers. Findings thus suggest that interventions targeting the families of sexual minority youth should educate parents about the potentially negative effects of heteronormative assumptions and attitudes on positive adolescent development.

AB  - The main objective of this review is to answer the following research questions: What are the effects of outreach programmes on problem/high-risk behaviour of young people between 8 and 25 years of age living in OECD countries? Are they less likely to experience an adverse outcome such as school failure or drop-out, runaway and homelessness, substance and/or alcohol abuse, unemployment, long-term poverty, delinquency and more serious criminal behaviour? The proposed project will follow standard procedures for conducting systematic reviews using meta-analysis techniques. In order to summarise what is known about the possible causal effects of outreach, all study designs will be included that use a well-defined control group. Nonrandomised studies, where outreach has occurred in the course of usual decisions outside the researcher's control, must demonstrate pretreatment group equivalence via matching, statistical controls or evidence of equivalence on key risk variables and participant characteristics. These factors will be outlined in the protocol, and the methodological appropriateness of the included studies will be assessed according to a risk of bias model.

AB  - Empirical research has been limited with respect to homelessness among college undergraduates. Research on educational outcomes has been limited to K-12th grade, but what is known points to worse outcomes for people who are homeless. The National Coalition for the Homeless (2014) reported that 75% of homeless or runaway teenagers drop out of school. Furthermore, while federal funding though the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act has been able to help younger students, funding for homeless youth considering or attending college is minimal. Recently, some more attention has been given to this issue through the College Cost Reduction Access Act (CCRAA) which allows unaccompanied homeless youth to be considered independent students when they file for federal financial aid. FAFSA data from 2013, the first time students were asked if they were homeless, noted that more than 30,000 students had answered yes (Garrick, 2014). However, the same article pointed out that many students would be reluctant to admit homelessness or they may not see their situation as being homeless (Garrick, 2014). The current study aimed to first describe a sample of college undergraduates who had any experience of homelessness or precarious housing in the previous year (N = 30), then the study compared an additional sample of homeless or precariously housed undergraduates to a group of students with stable housing (N = 113). Overall, the findings confirms one thing for sure: unstable housing has a negative impact on college students in many different domains of their lives. Several analyses indicated that homeless and precariously housed students differed significantly from stably housed students with respect to educational outcomes, physical health, recent stressful events, etc. The current study provides evidence that more attention needs to be directed at college undergraduates with unstable housing, so that the cycle of poverty may begin to diminish and these students may also be set up for academic and career success. Hopefully, the findings from this study allow for further exploration of homeless undergraduates including learning what the prevalence of this problem is as well as how it can be effectively addressed.

Found street youths in general to be at high risk, with the highest risks within older age segments of the male street youth population; paradoxically, these youths are least likely to be in contact with prevention services.

AB  - In this study, I compared the shifts in attitude of affluent high school seniors participating in a course on social justice issues to a control group of similar adolescents. In this course, participating adolescents learned about social justice issues such as homelessness, poverty, world hunger, and illegal immigration. An analysis of presurvey and postsurvey data revealed that the adolescents participating in the social justice course experienced a decline over the course of the semester in their support for educational equity between wealthy and poor communities. Interviews with these adolescents and analyses of their student work revealed that their shifts in attitude were influenced by fears about the possibility of one day becoming poor or homeless themselves.

AB  - School districts and other service providers are increasingly aware of the substantial mental health needs of students experiencing family homelessness. Past findings are mixed regarding whether homelessness conveys unique risk beyond the risks associated with extreme poverty. With prospective longitudinal data on homelessness experiences across childhood, we utilized latent profile analysis as a person-centered approach to conceptualizing mental health outcomes in adolescence for 3,778 youth. We considered literal family homelessness as well as families living doubled-up, and we employed propensity score matching to identify a comparison group of nonhomeless students balanced across a range of covariates to address systematic bias. Results indicated that students who experienced literal homelessness during childhood were significantly less likely to demonstrate profiles of resilience in mental health functioning. We considered our approach and findings in light of challenges and opportunities particularly relevant to the school context.

AB  - This report presents comprehensive information on juvenile crime, violence, and victimization and on the juvenile justice system. This report brings together the latest available statistics from a variety of sources and includes numerous tables, graphs, and maps, accompanied by analyses in clear, nontechnical language. The report offers Congress, state legislators and other state and local policymakers, professors and teachers, juvenile justice professionals, and concerned citizens empirically based answers to frequently asked questions about the nature of juvenile crime and victimization and about the justice system's response. Citing the FBI and other data sources, the Report demonstrates that the rate of juvenile violent crime arrests has consistently decreased since 1994, falling to a level not seen since at least the 1970s. However, during this period of overall decline in juvenile violence, the female proportion of juvenile violent crime arrests has increased (especially for the crime of assault), marking an important change in the types of youth entering the juvenile justice system and in their programming needs. The report also describes when and where juvenile violent crime occurs, focusing attention on the critical afterschool hours. Statistics presented throughout the report find that racial disparity in the juvenile justice system is declining. The report also presents new findings from OJJDP's national Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement. In sum, this report offers a clear view of juvenile crime and the justice system's response at the beginning of the 21st century.

AB  - This article shares the story of Lucy Bryson, who was hooked on crack cocaine and heroin when she was 17, and was working the streets to fund her addiction. Her future looked bleak when she was imprisoned four years ago but a project that builds trust and responsibility in young people by teaching them to work with animals has transformed her life. When she went to the prison chapel, Lucy met a group of young women from Victory Outreach UK, an organisation which provides "Christian homes" for vulnerable young people, including ex-offenders, drug addicts, alcoholics and the homeless. She joined a project run by one of the organisation's homes, based near Usk in South Wales, which helps young people break down barriers in their lives through caring for animals. Working at the project, she saw the difference working with animals could make to damaged young people and wanted to be a part of it. Four years on, Lucy is Animal Manager at the centre, helping "broken" young people, many with backgrounds as difficult as her own, rebuild their lives. Today, Lucy is a different person. She is now considered as a role model to the young people she works with.

AB  - These hearings transcripts compile testimony regarding how programs authorized by the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and the Missing Children's Assistance Act currently operate, in preparation for upcoming reauthorization. Opening statements by U.S. Representatives Peter Hoekstra (Michigan) and Ruben Hinojosa (Texas) underscore the obligation to protect runaway and homeless youth and provide assistance to families and law enforcement agencies in locating and recovering missing and exploited children. Testimony offered by the President of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children updated the Center's activities relevant to the mandates of the Missing Children's Assistance Act of 1984 and shared recommendations for the reauthorization, focusing on additions to its originally-mandated activities such as handling Internet child pornography and international child abduction cases, and the importance of the private sector in their work. The Managing Director of the Latin American Youth Center provided information on services to homeless Latino youth in the District of Columbia, highlighting the need for bilingual staff and making recommendations for program improvement. A formerly homeless youth who is currently working toward independent living and a college degree offered testimony on his experiences living on the street in the District of Columbia and explained how Covenant House had helped him. Questions for witnesses related to recruiting bilingual professionals, how diverse activities are coordinated, waiting lists for homeless services, the need for additional funding, the involvement of law enforcement and its interaction with social service providers, and the problem of the vast majority of runaways having no one looking for them. The transcripts' seven appendices contain written statements from witnesses and others and the findings of a statewide survey of homeless youth in Minnesota. (KB)

AB  - Using secondary analyses of data from a sample of 265 sexual minority youths, the authors examined correlates of cutting behavior to determine whether patterns are similar to those found in studies of self-injury with community samples of predominately heterosexual youths. The sample consisted of youths who received services at an urban social service agency serving the sexual minority community; youths from the region attending social events, who located the survey through the Internet, or who were referred from other youth-serving agencies; and youths from out of state who found the survey through the Internet or were referred by youth-serving agencies. Prevalence of cutting was higher than that found in community-based samples of similar age groups. However, similar patterns of risk were found with regard to peer victimization, homelessness, suicidality, and depression. Female and transgender respondents were more likely to have engaged in cutting behavior than were male respondents. No significant race-based differences emerged. Both age and having knowledge of a supportive adult were associated with decreased likelihood of cutting. Additional findings link higher levels of "outness," higher occurrence of suicidality among social network, and higher rates of smoking to increased likelihood of cutting. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.

AB  - In this multi-faceted exploratory study, administrative data were used to examine trends in residential care utilization by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) and youth outcomes from 1993 to 2003. Multivariate analyses were conducted to determine the factors associated with entry to residential care and discharge/post-discharge placement outcomes. We examined case records and conducted interviews with key informants to understand the decisions-making processes surrounding placement in residential care. This study found that statewide utilization of residential care declined sharply between 1995 and 2003 and that residential care is now used primarily as the placement of last resort--only after youth have experienced multiple failed placements or have been placed in locked settings. It showed that as residential care utilization declined, the composition of youth in residential care changed. On average, analysis revealed that residential care programs now serve more troubled youth than in previous years. Almost 60 percent of youth who entered residential care in 2002 experienced negative discharge outcomes. Many youth who left residential care for foster care or potentially permanent family settings eventually returned to higher levels of care and youth who experienced more placements prior to entering residential care were more likely to have negative discharge and post-discharge outcomes. Boys were at higher risk than girls of entering residential care and of experiencing negative residential care discharge and post-discharge outcomes. The findings highlight the need to improve supportive and therapeutic services at multiple points in time: when children first enter foster care, during residential care, and after discharge from residential care.

AB  - Providing stable housing for runaway and homeless youth is a major function of a transitional living program. This article introduces the focus of one program working with LGBTQ youth in New York City and discusses some issues to consider when working with this population. The article also presents data associated with young people's lives after discharge. In any discussion of outcomes, both reason for discharge and length of stay play important roles in whether or not an exit is safe. Regardless of these two elements, the places youth move to when leaving programs are crucial to their safety and well-being. The exit can be safe even when a young person is discharged early from a program. This article presents types of exits, as well as status of employment and school enrollment at exit. Some youth and staff-identified lessons gained in the program also are discussed in detail. Types of aftercare services sought by discharged youth are specified. This article also describes any differences in outcomes for youth with and without foster care experience. (Contains 3 figures and 3 tables.)

AB  - This study examines type-specific and cumulative experiences of violence among a vulnerable population of youth. Sixty high-risk, shelter-dwelling, urban youth were interviewed regarding their history of childhood maltreatment, exposure to community violence (ECV), and experience with intimate partner violence (IPV). Results show a high prevalence and high degree of overlap among multiple types of violence exposure. Childhood physical, sexual (CSA), and emotional (CEA) abuse were interrelated and were associated with ECV. Cumulative experiences of childhood abuse (CCA) had a graded association with IPV victimization. In multivariate analyses, CCA and ECV were independently associated with IPV victimization. Gender moderated the effect of one association: CEA raised the risk of IPV victimization for girls but not for boys. Only CSA predicted IPV perpetration. Findings suggest that cumulative exposures to violence create cumulative risk for experiencing more violence. Shelter-dwelling, urban youth may be particularly vulnerable to this additive effect.

AB  - This qualitative study examined the meanings ascribed to the construct "home" by 208 youths defined by mainstream society as "homeless". Youth narratives on the topic of home ranged across a continuum with home as state at one end (i.e., home is a state of mind, comprised of one's friends) and home as place at the other (i.e., home as a physical dwelling). Youths employing the former meanings had typically been on the street for longer periods and identified with counterculture-type ideologies. For youths who defined home as place, home was constructed in direct opposition to street experiences. For both of these groups, control emerged as a central theme in their narratives. The implications of these findings for engaging youth and goal setting regarding exiting the streets are described.

Discrepant reporting includes situations in which a respondent denies experiencing abuse in general but reports being a victim of specific forms of maltreatment. The results revealed that discrepant reporting rates tended to be highest for minor physical assault and for noncontact sexual abuse. Multivariate results revealed that demographic characteristics were important correlates of both discrepant physical and sexual abuse reporters. Family background characteristics also played a role in discrepant reporting for physical abuse. Overall, some young people with abuse histories are not adequately labeling their maltreatment experiences and, as a result, may not be receiving the necessary treatment. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - This study investigated factors leading to employment and unemployment for young people living in urban and rural areas in Scotland. Surveys and interviews were conducted with 817 youths, 40 rural employers, and 25 professionals from across Scotland. Findings include: (1) long-term youth unemployment was less common in rural than in urban areas, but rural labor markets were characterized by low skilled and insecure employment, with low demand for qualified workers; (2) with rural employment being concentrated in small firms, opportunities for young people to upgrade their skills were limited; (3) many rural employers had a poor knowledge of the New Deal, and even those who were aware of the program frequently were unable to meet minimum training requirements or provide access to external training; (4) poor or costly transport frequently restricted young people's employment opportunities; (5) social networks facilitated access to job opportunities for those young people with good local contacts, while lack of social networks was an important barrier to employment; (6) although female workers were often in high demand in tourist-related services, those with children frequently lacked access to childcare facilities; and (7) a shortage of affordable housing restricted the labor mobility of young people and caused difficulties for those who wished to remain within their local area. Appendices present quantitative methods, people interviewed, and regression variables. (Contains 18 references.) (TD)

AB  - We used a life stress framework to examine linkages between distal or primary stressors (e.g., child abuse) and proximal or secondary stressors (e.g., street victimization) and their association with substance use among 150 youth experiencing homelessness in the Midwestern United States. Results revealed that numerous primary stressors such as number of times youth ran from home and number of foster care placements were associated with secondary stressors, such as anxiety, total duration of homelessness, and street victimization. Only street physical victimization (e.g., been beaten up since leaving home) was associated with greater substance use. Our findings provide a more holistic picture of both distal and proximal life stressors that these young people experience and reveal the complexity of issues that service providers must acknowledge when working with this population.

AB  - The goal of this analysis was to examine gender differences in the experiences of children and adolescents found on city streets. It has been proposed that girls who leave home to seek their survival on city streets are from more disturbed families than boys, reflecting cultural factors that result in differential norms for male and female behavior. Although boys and girls may share the common condition of being "on the streets," they may be on distinct developmental trajectories, with girls more likely to exhibit stress than boys. The current analysis examined whether male and female street youth living in a large Brazilian city differ in their family situation and in their adjustment to the street. Some family variables differed for females and males in ways predicted by the cultural hypothesis. However, examination of current functioning did not support the view that girls are more distressed than boys on the street. Furthermore, boys and girls did not differ dramatically on most variables measured in this study, suggesting that their experiences have much in common. (Contains five tables.) (MKA)

AB  - Children who are homeless or in foster care change schools more often than their non-mobile peers. The impact of school mobility increases their risk of academic failure (Evans, 1996; Ingersoll, Scamman, & Eckerling, 1989; Mao, 1997, Mehana & Reynolds, 2003; Reynolds & Wolf, 1999). Laws enforcing the right of students to remain in their "original school of enrollment," help increase academic achievement. Two of these laws are the McKinney-Vento Act, a federal law protecting the rights of homeless youth (United States Department of Education, 2004), and AB490, a state law that supports the education of foster youth (Shea, Weinberg, & Zetlin, 2004). Both laws allow students to remain at their original school of enrollment so that they do not have to change schools even if their housing situation changes. Although these laws are in place, homeless and foster youth still tend to change schools more often than their housed peers. This study analyzes indicators of academic achievement including grade point averages, California Standard Test scores, attendance rates, credits earned, and suspensions for seventh through twelfth grade homeless, foster youth, and a non-mobile comparison group in the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 school years. Address moves and school moves were also analyzed for their impact on academic achievement. The statistical procedures used in this study include correlation coefficients, a canonical correlation, four 3 x 2 repeated measures ANOVAs, and a series of 11 one-way ANOVAs to analyze whether school mobility variables have a statistically significant impact on the academic achievement variables for homeless and foster youth when compared to a third group of non-mobile, or housed students. Almost all procedures yielded statistical differences between the non-mobile comparison group and homeless and foster youth, although there were very few differences found between the homeless and foster students in this study.

AB  - Sexual minority youth are more likely to run away from home or experience homelessness, leaving them at increased risk of victimization and negative health outcomes. In this study, the authors use a developmental perspective that considers both vulnerable beginnings in families and the risky trajectories that follow to explore the connections between running away or being thrown out by parents and sexual minority women's and men's health in adulthood. Using four waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), the authors consider multiple dimensions of health and several potential intervening mechanisms. Findings suggest that runaway and thrownaway experiences have persistent negative effects on health into adulthood, in part because of their association with sexual victimization, educational attainment, and relationships with parents. Sexual minority men who have been thrown out by parents report a greater likelihood of suicidal ideation, smoking, and substance use into adulthood. Sexual minority women with runaway experiences have poorer health and increased depressive symptoms, while women with thrownaway experiences engage in more health risk behaviors. Sexual victimization stands out as a key mechanism for sexual minority women's health, as more than half of these young women report experiences of sexual victimization.

AB  - This study examined the associations between lifetime mental disorder, comorbidity, and self-reported postrunaway arrests among 428 (187 males, 241 females) homeless and runaway youth. The analysis examined the pattern of arrests across five lifetime mental disorders (alcohol abuse, drug abuse, conduct disorder, major depressive episode, and posttraumatic stress disorder). The adolescents, ranging from 16 to 19 years old, were interviewed directly on the streets and in shelters in four Midwestern states using computer-assisted personal interviewing. Extensive self-reports of early life history, behaviors since running away from home, and diagnostic interviewing (UM-CIDI and DISC-R) were used to estimate possible disorders. There was a high level of postrunaway arrests reported by the youth; more than half were arrested at least once after the initial runaway, with the average of 4.4 times. Consistent with the hypotheses, there were differential associations between individual mental disorders and involvement with the criminal justice system. Only externalizing disorders such as substance abuse and conduct disorder were related to arrest. Street youth with multiple externalizing and internalizing disorders were more likely to be arrested than nondisordered youths.

AB  - Teenagers' running from foster placement is a significant problem in the field of child protection. This article describes a functional, behavior analytic approach to reducing running away through assessing the motivations for running, involving the youth in the assessment process, and implementing interventions to enhance the reinforcing value of placements for adolescents, thereby reducing the probability of running and associated unsafe periods. A case study illustrates this approach and a study compares 13 adolescents who ran away frequently and received interventions with a group of matched adolescents who had similar patterns of running but received only services as usual. The percentage of days on runaway status showed a significant pre-post reduction for those in the functional group, in contrast to no statistical change in the comparison group. Potential benefits this approach may have for foster care and child protection in improving youth safety, permanence, and connections for life are discussed. (Contains 1 table and 4 figures.)

AB  - "The Condition of Education 2017" is a congressionally mandated annual report summarizing the latest data on education in the United States. This report is designed to help policymakers and the public monitor educational progress. This year's report includes 50 indicators on topics ranging from prekindergarten through postsecondary education, as well as labor force outcomes and international comparisons. "The Condition" includes an "At a Glance" section, which allows readers to quickly make comparisons within and across indicators, and a "Highlights" section, which captures a key finding or set of findings from each indicator. The report contains a "Reader's Guide," a "Glossary," and a "Guide to Data Sources" that provide additional information to help place the indicators in context. In addition, each indicator references the data tables that were used to produce the indicator, most of which are in the "Digest of Education Statistics." In addition to the regularly updated annual indicators, this year's report highlights innovative data collections and analyses from across the Center: (1) The first spotlight indicator examines the relationship between student risk factors at kindergarten entry (poverty and low parent educational attainment) and academic achievement in early elementary school; (2) The second spotlight indicator draws on administrative data from the Center's EDFacts data collection and finds that 2.5 percent of students in U.S. public elementary and secondary schools were reported as homeless in 2014-15; (3) The third spotlight indicator draws on longitudinal data from the Beginning Postsecondary Students Study to examine the rates at which first-time college students persist toward completion of a degree or certificate; and (4) The fourth spotlight indicator examines how disability rates for U.S. adults vary by educational attainment, finding that 16 percent of 25- to 64-year-olds who had not completed high school had one or more disabilities in 2015, compared to 4 percent of those who had completed a bachelor's degree and 3 percent of those who had completed a master's or higher degree. In addition, two indicators provide insights from the Center's recent work on technology in education. The first previews key findings from the Center's upcoming report, "Student Access to Digital Learning Resources Outside of the Classroom." The second presents findings from the National Assessment of Educational Progress's 8th-grade Technology and Engineering Literacy (TEL) assessment.

AB  - All young people have the potential to succeed--to do well academically, socially, and economically. Some young people, though, experience cumulative and chronic adversity along the way--disrupting their opportunities to thrive. Young people have the best chance to realize their potential when communities can intentionally align support with young people's needs and strengths. Given that so many youth face adversities that undermine their potential, the Center for Promise is intent on learning more about Adverse Life Experiences (ALEs), their effects, and the kinds of support and resources youth need to thrive in spite of them. This report, a collection of findings from four separate studies with three independent and representative data collections on youth in America, offers insights and recommendations that can be used by practitioners and policymakers to help mitigate the impact that multiple adversities have on the lives of America's youth.

AB  - The "Youth Villages Transitional Living Evaluation" is testing whether the "Transitional Living" program, operated by the social service organization Youth Villages, makes a difference in the lives of young people with histories of foster care or juvenile justice custody. The program, which was renamed "YVLifeSet" in April 2015, is intended to help these young people make a successful transition to adulthood by providing intensive, individualized, and clinically focused case management, support, and counseling. This is the second major report in the evaluation. An earlier report provides a detailed description of the "Transitional Living" program model and assesses its implementation. This second report assesses whether the program affected key outcomes during the first year after young people enrolled in the study. After one year, the program increased earnings, reduced homelessness and material hardship, and improved outcomes related to health and safety. These findings set the stage for additional analysis using a second year of follow-up data and an assessment of the program's benefits relative to its costs. Those results will be available in 2016. Appendices to this report include: (1) Survey Response Bias Analysis and (2) Definitions of the Scales Used in This Report.

AB  - This study reports on the leisure time, financial, gambling, and social activities of a large sample of children with hyperactivity (H group, N = 149) and children who served as a control group (CC group, N = 72) from the Southeastern Wisconsin (Milwaukee) region tracked for 13-15 years to young adulthood (ages 19--25, M = 20 years). Participant interviews were used to gather information on the amount of time they spent in various leisure activities, the amount of their monthly earnings and the proportion they spent on various expenses, and their gambling activities and amounts they expended in those activities. The results revealed that the H group spent significantly more hours engaged in watching television, listening to music, socialising on the telephone, and engaging in their hobbies relative to the control group. While the H group at this early stage of adulthood was earning more monthly income, no differences were found in the proportion of that income being spent on various categories of monthly expenditures except that the CC group paid a larger percentage of their income to credit card bills. This difference probably stems from more of the CC group having credit cards than the H group. Few group differences emerged in the specific kinds of gambling activities examined. Few group differences were evident in the closeness of family relationships as children, or currently, or in the number of social or dating relationships they enjoyed in high school or currently. The H group, however, had a lower quality of current dating relationships, fewer current close friends, more trouble keeping friends, and were more likely to argue with friends than those in the CC group. Findings also revealed that more of the H group had experienced going without food or shelter (homelessness) due to a lack of money since leaving high school, intimating that a subset of the H group may be having greater problems with adult self-sufficiency than those in the CC group.

AB  - Although previous research has examined correlates of running away among samples of currently homeless and runaway adolescents, little is known about what factors will predict the likelihood that a housed adolescent with no prior history of running away will leave home. As such, the current study uses the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to examine predictors of running away among a diverse sample of housed adolescents ages 12 through 13. Results indicate that socioeconomic status, being African American or Hispanic, and monitoring were significantly predictive of a decrease in the mean rate of running away in midadolescence. In contrast, being female, neighborhood victimization, personal victimization, school suspension, and delinquency all significantly increased the expected frequency of running away. Although findings provide some support for previous cross-sectional studies, they also point to the importance of young people's community environment as a risk factor for leaving home.

AB  - As trusted health care providers in the school setting, school nurses are positioned uniquely to identify children at risk for or victims of commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC). Nevertheless, many victims go unrecognized and unaided due to inadequate provider education on victim identification. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the major risk factors for CSEC of girls aged 12-18, the largest group of CSEC victims in the United States. A search of four databases (Web of Science, CINAHL, PsychINFO, and PubMed) yielded 21 articles with domestic focus, published in English between January 2014 and May 2020. While childhood maltreatment trauma was found most relevant, a variety of other risk factors were identified. Future nursing research is called to address the numerous research gaps identified in this review that are crucial for the development of policies and procedures supporting school nurses in recognizing victims quickly and intervening appropriately.

AB  - A 1997 study by Lomas and Garside suggests a 62% prevalence rate of ADHD [Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder] amongst homeless, which prompts a need for further elucidation of this relationship. This study sought to examine the relationship between Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and the homeless youth population aged 18-24. The overall focus was to investigate the prevalence rate of ADHD in homeless youth 18-24 and to examine the relationship between ADHD diagnosis (utilizing WURS [Wender Utah Rating Scale] and ASRSv1.1 [Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale]) and relational variables. A structured survey instrument was developed to collect interview data on demographics, employment status, substance abuse and housing instability variables. Twenty-four homeless youths (n = 24, 20 males, 4 females; age range, 18-24, mean age = 21.71 years) were randomly approached (n = 85 approached) and verbally screened for study inclusion based upon reported age between 18 to 24 years. Participants were administered the ASRS-v1.1 and WURS dichotomous response structured survey instruments to determine ADHD diagnosis. Study data suggests a higher prevalence of ADHD in ages 18-21 (WURS 75%; ASRS-v1.1 88%) than ages 22-24 (WURS 56%; ASRS-v1.1 88%). Data suggests a marginally higher rate of ADHD diagnosis in males (ASRS-v1.1 95%; WURS 75%) than females (ASRS-v1.1 75%; WURS 75%). Participants in the 18-21-age cohort experienced an average of 68 days of housing instability while participants in the 22-24-age cohort experienced a proportionally higher average of 278 days of housing instability. Both age cohorts (18-21 and 22-24) suggested a 100% rate of unemployment and substance abuse. Data suggests a higher prevalence of ADHD in homeless youth aged 18-21 (WURS 75%; ASRS-v1.1 88%) that were newly homeless (avg. days experienced housing instability, 68), which may suggest that ADHD symptomatology could be a vulnerability factor influencing youth homelessness. The following are appended: (1) Structured Interview; (2) Consent Form; (3) Survey Instrument ASRS-v1.1: Sample Questions; (4) Survey Instrument WURS: Sample Questions; and (5) Recruitment/Interview Protocols.

AB  - This Research-to-Impact brief is the seventh in a series by Chapin Hall's Voices of Youth Count on understanding and addressing youth homelessness. Each year, nearly 4.2 million adolescents and young adults in America experience some form of homelessness. This brief focuses on the subset of young people who experience homelessness after spending time in foster care. Findings show that between one-quarter and one-third of youth and young adults experiencing homelessness had a history of foster care. The findings also reveal that young people's entry into foster care was often part of a larger pattern of family instability and was perceived by some young people as the beginning of their experience with homelessness. The research shows that there are multiple pathways to homelessness from foster care.

The statistical report is based on 19 indicators of child well being: (1) low birth weight infants; (2) infant mortality rate; (3) child death rate; (4) births to single teens; (5) juvenile violent crime arrest rate; (6) percent graduating from high school on time; (7) percent teens not in school and not in the labor force; (8) teen violent death rate; (9) child poverty rate; (10) births to unwed mothers; (11) prenatal care; (12) child abuse and neglect rates; (13) corporal punishments in school; (14) suspensions; (15) non-promotions to the next grade; (16) percent passing competency exams in math and communication; (17) delinquency rates; (18) detentions and transfers to adult court; and (19) percent children in single parent families. Section 1 provides information on population and economics. Section 2 details births, and Section 3 focuses on child safety and deaths. Section 4 deals with education, while Section 5 addresses youth and the law. Section 6 presents county data. Findings indicate that Florida ranks 48th in child well-being nationwide. Although infant mortality and prenatal care have improved and the high school graduation rate has stabilized, too many children are jeopardized by abuse, unsafe environments, and crime; and the number of cases entering the juvenile justice system has increased 93 percent in the past 10 years. Appendices presents county rates for each indicator, racial and age group differences, terminology, and data sources. (KDFB)

AB  - The paper reports the results of preliminary analyses of longitudinal data on legally and functionally emancipated children in North Carolina. In North Carolina, children legally achieve emancipation through judicial order, by joining the military, or through marriage. Functionally emancipated children include minor children who live outside the family. The discussion describes characteristics of the sample of 695 children, who were grouped in two cohorts. One cohort began to be tracked when children were in the fourth grade and the other when the children were in the seventh grade. Four categories of functional emancipation are identified; these are based primarily on the living arrangements that subjects formed, outside their original families: with a boyfriend or girlfriend, with a same-age friend, with foster parents or in county homes, or with another relative. About 12 percent of subjects were emancipated in one form or another before they were 18 years old. Findings indicated that these children were less prepared for living on their own than were children who remained at home. In the seventh grade, emancipated girls in particular differed from their peers in socioeconimic status, race, and aggressive behaviors. Excerpts from interviews characterize youth pressured to, or wanting to, leave home, and chaotic family conditions reflecting abdication, rejection, and longing. Descriptive data on runaways is briefly discussed. (RH)

AB  - An overview of the history of adolescent runaway behavior indicates that it has become a social and psychological problem of significant proportions. This study investigated the use of a personality measure that was hypothesized to be representative of a cluster of behaviors associated with running away. The study also sought to determine a predictive equation by comparing a group of adolescent runaways (N=61) to two other criterion groups: a maladjusted sample (N=59) and a control sample (N=60). In addition, it was hypothesized that there would be differences between the samples and that selected variables would distinguish between the groups. The standardized personality measure used was the short form of the Personality Inventory for Children-Revised (PIC-R). The findings indicated that the PIC-R is an extremely effective personality measure. This instrument's ability to conceptually represent the behavior and personality problems of runaway adolescents is excellent. Its utility is further enhanced by its sensitivity in discriminating criterion groups. This sensitivity is exceptional because of the actuarial interpretive system associated with this instrument, which enables the PIC-R to detect the presence or absence of psychopathology. It is recommended that, since more psychologically disturbed youth are seeking services at runaway programs and that since the PIC-R is able to detect psychopathology in the runaway adolescent, mental health services be provided to the adolescent and his/her family on the agency's premises.

AB  - Little has been written on the personal experience of the researcher as it relates to data collection, data analysis and interpretation of results. Even more scarce has been knowledge that addresses the challenges and barriers faced by 21st century researchers engaged in ethnographic data collection amidst culturally diverse populations. The present work has addressed these gaps in the literature by detailing the personal, methodological and cultural challenges encountered by this researcher in a larger study which utilized a mixed method design to investigate homeless street youth in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Results indicated the need for social workers to possess an awareness of their own limitations and biases as it may relate to cultural differences. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - Treatment evaluation for alcohol problem, runaway adolescents and their families is rare. This study recruited primary alcohol problem adolescents (N = 119) and their primary caretakers from two runaway shelters and assigned them to (a) home-based ecologically based family therapy (EBFT), (b) office-based functional family therapy (FFT), or (c) service as usual (SAU) through the shelter. Findings showed that both home-based EBFT and office-based FFT significantly reduced alcohol and drug use compared with SAU at 15-month postbaseline. Measures of family and adolescent functioning improved over time in all groups. However, significant differences among the home- and office-based interventions were found for treatment engagement and moderators of outcome.

AB  - Objective: To examine the association between frequency of family dinners (FFD) and selected problem behaviors for adolescents after adjusting for family connectedness, parental awareness, other family activities, and other potentially confounding factors. Methods: Data are drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997. The primary variable of interest is self-reported FFD in a typical week. Problem behaviors studied are substance-use, physical violence, property-destruction, stealing, running away from home, and gang membership. Multivariate logistic models are estimated for each behaviors. Linear regression models are estimated for behavior-frequency for the sub-samples engaging in them. Analysis is done separately by gender. Results: FFD is negatively associated with substance-use and running away for females; drinking, physical violence, property-destruction, stealing and running away for males. Conclusion: Family meals are negatively associated to certain problem behaviors for adolescents even after controlling rigorously for potentially confounding factors. Thus, programs that promote family meals are beneficial. (Contains 6 tables.)

AB  - Little is known about trauma-related symptoms among runaway adolescents. Precocious departure from familial homes often exposes youth to traumatic victimization. This study examined the extent to which runaway adolescents present trauma symptomotology and assessed factors that predict trauma symptoms. Participants (N = 350) were 12-18 years of age and currently domiciled in youth emergency shelters. Results showed that trauma symptoms were not significantly greater than found among other youth norms. Multiple regression models indicated that being male, experiencing depression, sexual concerns, and problems in family functioning significantly predicted trauma-related symptoms of anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and dissociation. However, lack of peer support, depression, and substance abuse predicted the trauma-related symptom of anger. Findings suggest that effective services target the entire family unit and develop greater cohesion and support within the family. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - In North Carolina, the Task Force on the Achievement of Culturally Diverse Students was established to respond to specific goals and objectives that speak to the achievement of African American, Native American, and Hispanic American students. Issues on homeless children and youths were addressed to a lesser extent since this group represents a unique culture in many urban schools. The Task Force examined annual dropout studies and other state and national studies. A cohort of nine low-performing school districts with high minority enrollment and federal Indian Education Act or Migrant Education funds was selected. All were located in rural counties identified as low wealth. Findings supported, as have most studies, the relationship between race, poverty, and school success, and they indicated that these adverse effects often last throughout a student's entire educational career. Recommendations are made in the areas of multicultural education, school restructuring, educational finance, educational technology, special education, and education for the homeless. Part II contains specific committee reports in four areas: (1) professional education; (2) school restructuring; (3) comprehensive services; and (4) educational technology. An appendix contains nine illustrative figures and a model description. (Contains 18 references.) (SLD)

AB  - This publication presents data about population characteristics in New York City from city, state, and federal agencies and synthesizes large data sets into basic indicators of social and economic wellbeing and tracking conditions for children in New York City's 59 community districts. It ranks child wellbeing in the districts across a range of categories (poverty, wealth, health, youth development, housing and community life, child safety, education, and environmental quality). Risks are measured and ranked using a composite index. The report also compares child wellbeing in New York City and elsewhere, reports changes over time, examines race and ethnic differences, and documents risks to young school-age and older children. It includes six community profiles and a community-building chart. The community profiles provide an in-depth look at life for children in different neighborhoods. Special attention is paid to the economic conditions children face in these communities, as well as child health, access to affordable child care, and other indicators of child wellbeing. The community-building chart ranks community districts based on the availability of private and public services for children. Service quality is also tracked via data on program accreditation. Complete data tables are appended. (SM)

AB  - This Formative Evaluation Lessons Learned template captures the major findings and lessons learned from the formative evaluation of the Youth Transitions Partnership (YTP) program in Alameda County, California. The YTP program is an intervention built around the core components of intensive case management and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). In partnership with Alameda County's Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), First Place for Youth (FPFY) served as the program provider, bringing overall case and systems coordination to the YTP program, and Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago served as the local evaluator, conducting a comprehensive formative evaluation which included implementing a CQI framework. The formative evaluation addressed questions about the extent to which process, quality, and capacity investments were deployed to support the installation and initial implementation of the YTP model as well as questions about program engagement and the short- and medium-term outcomes of program participants. These questions include: (1) Does the administrative risk assessment process correctly identify members of the target population?; (2) Are enrollment staff able to connect with and enroll youth?; (3) Is the intensive case management component of the intervention being delivered as intended?; (4) Is DBT being delivered to program participants as intended?; and (5) Is there evidence that program participants are progressing toward short- and medium-term outcomes?

AB  - Data from the Nurse-Family Partnership intervention program were analyzed to compare the "selection" versus "unique" effects of maternal jail time on adolescent antisocial and health risk outcomes. Data from 320 women and their firstborn children were available from the prenatal, birth, and 15-year assessments. Consistent with a selection perspective, prenatal and demographic risks directly and indirectly related to many adolescent antisocial outcomes. Maternal conviction and arrest were also associated with adolescent contact with the criminal justice system and health risk behaviors. Maternal jail time predicted whether or not children had ever been stopped by police, sent to youth corrections, or run away from home. However, these associations were not significant after controlling for prenatal risk factors and maternal conviction and arrest. The results highlight the importance of maternal criminality and other risk factors in children's environments, including prenatal variables. (Contains 7 tables.)

The study sampled 23 former foster care youth using transitional living services in Northern California. Hourly wage, money saved, and employment status outcomes were examined at discharge, and housing outcomes were examined 6 months post discharge. Variables that demonstrated improvement post intervention include hourly wage, housing situation, employment, and money saved. At a 6-month follow-up, 90% of youth with known housing situations were in permanent, stable housing. Comparing youth with employment training and those without on hourly wage, youth with training had significantly higher hourly wages. Transitional living and employment training programs may be effective interventions for former foster care youth with few resources. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - This report evaluates the High Risk Youth Demonstration Project, which is predicated on the idea that youth-serving agencies (YSAs) can be key sources for adolescent AIDS education. When the Center for Population Options (CPO) conceptualized a strategy for bringing AIDS education to underserved youth, it was responding to the following three areas of concern: (1) that youth deserved, but were not receiving, adolescent-specific comprehensive AIDS education; (2) that the AIDS epidemic was taking an unknown toll on homeless, street, minority, and disenfranchised youth; and (3) that mainstream YSAs remained underused in the national campaign to prevent HIV infection. While many YSAs had begun to offer sexuality education, few had taken the next step into HIV prevention and AIDS education. In 1988, CPO approached three youth-serving agencies with a plan for collaboration. CPO selected the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), the Salvation Army, and the Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America to pilot-test model HIV prevention programs at their affiliate levels. The report evaluates the overall project and the emerging programs of each participating agency, highlighting program findings through a case-by-case study. The report includes a list of five references and an appendix summarizing evaluation designs and results. (AF)

AB  - This study surveyed 337 mothers residing in New York City homeless shelters regarding their backgrounds and experiences, comparing those who were teen mothers to homeless mothers who had children later in life. Two groups of homeless families emerged: those with a foundation for advancement and those deprived of opportunities by the early burden of parenthood. Many homeless teen mothers grew up in unstable environments, with 61 percent reporting negative relationships with their parents and half stressing the absence of positive family role models. Most of these women sought companionship elsewhere and became sexually active very young. They demonstrated a profound lack of knowledge or interest regarding birth control. Homeless mothers who were not teen parents were more knowledgeable about sexual activity. Being a teen mother perpetuated the cycle of teen motherhood. Teenage families experienced significantly more episodes of homelessness than did non-teenage families. While minority groups represented half of the city's overall population, they comprised 91 percent of all homeless families in shelters, with African Americans overrepresented by two to one. Shelters can help break the cycle of pregnancy, poverty, and homelessness by coordinating efforts with policymakers to provide support to women at the greatest risk of becoming, or who already are, teen mothers. A nurturing environment can also be grounded in education. (SM)

AB  - The high rates of substance use among American adolescents are challenging; however, runaway youth are at particularly high-risk for substance use. Runaway youth utilizing two service sectors, emergency crisis shelters and juvenile detention centers, were recruited to evaluate differences in risk factors associated with substance use. Findings demonstrate that youth admitted to juvenile detention (n = 121) had proportionally higher levels of problem behaviors, including substance use, than youth admitted to shelter services (n = 156). Both groups of youth have significantly higher levels of substance use than national estimates. The most significant risk factor for alcohol and marijuana use among youth in both groups was using other substances. Addressing issues of substance abuse among runaway youth must be a prime objective for future research and treatment for this high-risk population.

AB  - In the present report we describe patterns of traumatic events and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), both partial and full, among homeless youth and those at risk for homelessness, with an emphasis on gender differences. Participants were 85 homeless and at-risk youth (49% female) recruited from a drop-in center in New York City in 2000. Youth completed a structured interview lasting 1.5 h. Rates of childhood maltreatment were substantial. Further, almost all youth experienced at least one traumatic event, with most experiencing multiple types of trauma. Gender differences were found in the types, but not prevalence or magnitude, of childhood maltreatment and traumatic events experienced. Partial symptomatology of PTSD was common for females but not males. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were found to co-occur with PTSD for females, which may complicate treatment efforts. Further investigation of the impact of trauma on homeless males is needed.

AB  - No study to date has reported intimate partner violence (IPV) experiences among homeless youth. This study sought to uncover lifetime prevalence estimates of physical, sexual, and emotional IPV among a nonprobability sample of 180 homeless male and female youth in Columbus, Ohio. To that aim, self-reported IPV and the association between IPV and gender, race, age, and history of childhood abuse were examined. Results showed that physical violence and verbal abuse were the most commonly reported experiences of IPV in the current sample and ranged from 30.0% to 35.4%. Women and those with a history of childhood abuse were more likely to be victimized by their intimate partners. Specifically, multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that women were approximately twice as likely as men to be verbally and physically abused in intimate relationships. Moreover, youth who reported being victims of abuse in childhood were more than twice as likely to experience verbal abuse and physical violence in their relationships. Given the high lifetime occurrence of IPV among homeless youth, intervention efforts should target IPV to prevent future occurrence. Findings also suggest that intervention efforts should consider gender and history of childhood abuse. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB  - This study examines the psychometric properties of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire short form (CTQ-SF) with street youth who have run away or been expelled from their homes (N = 397). Internal reliability coefficients for the five clinical scales ranged from 0.65 to 0.95. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to test the five-factor structure of the scales yielding acceptable fit for the total sample. Additional multigroup analyses were performed to consider items by gender. Results provided only evidence of weak factorial invariance. Constrained models showed invariance in configuration, factor loadings, and factor covariances but failed for equality of intercepts. Mean trauma scores for street youth tended to fall in the moderate to severe range on all abuse/neglect clinical scales. Females reported higher levels of abuse and neglect. Prevalence of child maltreatment of individual forms was very high with 98% of street youth reporting one or more forms; 27.4% of males and 48.9% of females reported all five forms. Results of this study support the viability of the CTQ-SF for screening maltreatment in a highly vulnerable street population. Caution is recommended when comparing prevalence estimates for male and female street youth given the failure of the strong factorial multigroup model. (Contains 6 tables.)

"The Homeless in Contemporary Society" (edited by R. D. Bingham, R. E. Green, and S. B. White), is a primer on homelessness in America. "Gender Influences in Classroom Interaction" (edited by L. C. Wilkinson and C. B. Marrett) consists of 11 conference papers that discuss the ways that gender-related differences are manifested in school. "Effective Education: A Minority Policy Perspective" (C. V. Willie) presents a case for maintaining the integrity of black culture throughout a student's educational experience. "Class, Race, & Gender in American Education" (edited by L. Weis) consists of 13 essays that address the ways schools foster inequalities based on students' sex, race, and class. "Toward Black Undergraduate Student Equality in American Higher Education" (edited by M. T. Nettles) consists of a collection of essays that document the barriers that black college-bound students must overcome, and makes recommendations for educational reform, government policy, and private agency programs that can reduce these obstacles. "Policies for America's Public Schools: Teachers, Equity & Indicators" (edited by R. Haskins and D. MacRae) consists of nine papers that cover the three education areas that the editors believe are most in need of reform: (1) teachers and teaching; (2) diversity and equity; and (3) the uses of information and educational indicators.

AB  - Prepared to help rural communities meet the needs of troubled and delinquent youth, this booklet describes exemplary programs implemented in nine rural areas. The introduction outlines the specific problems faced by rural communities and small towns in providing youth services, i.e., limited resources to focus on youth problems, greater distances between providers and consumers, and few opportunities for information exchange among professionals within a state or region. The selected programs illustrate innovative ways of delivering a variety of services including non-secure detention facilities for status offenders and other troubled youth, meaningful recreation and education for rural youth, counseling, crisis intervention, and support for the families of youthful offenders. Program descriptions provide a brief characterization of the community, the impetus for developing the youth program, and a picture of the youth served and the services provided. The programs described are Mountain Plains Youth Service Coalition, Pierre, SD; Foster Home Program, Hamilton, MT; Day and Residential Services for Youth, Opelousas, LA; Rural Transportation Program, Council Bluffs, IA; Alternative School, David, KY; Non-Secure Detention Facility, Marquette, MI; Drop-In Center, Jackson, WY; Family Partners Program, Decorah, IA; and Youth Specialist, Sterling, CO.

AB  - Displaced learners, uprooted because of conflict, poverty, or other major traumas, are often shut out of opportunities to learn engineering. At the same time, fragile contexts demand engineers' expertise, but experts and their engineered solutions are often called in from outside the community. In this article, we examine engineering learning as a vehicle for development in displaced communities by expanding the representation of engineers to explicitly include refugees and formerly homeless youth. We describe an alternative, co-created approach to providing authentic engineering learning through a framework called Localized Engineering in Displacement. Grounded in principles of critical pedagogy and social justice, this framework is structured to integrate technical content, professional skills, and engineering design, all focused on needs identified by the local students themselves. The Localized framework encompasses the curriculum itself, the collaborative attitudes and humility of partners involved, the prioritization of local engineers' learning pathways, the pedagogical capacity building of local instructors, and the institutional partnerships required to recognize and implement students' work. In addition to describing our framework and situating it in the literature, we document two major program outcomes: empowered identity and community impact. Refugee learners and former street youth in the community develop their self-image as engineers, especially after being in positions of low levels of agency or control over their lives. The keystone to the program is our collaboration with local learning spaces (usually in-country implementing NGOs) and community institutions to invest in long-term implementation of solutions. We discuss multiple aspects of community impact, including the engineered products that student members of low-resource communities create, ongoing community teacher development, and collaborative research.

AB  - Between September 2003 and December 2004, the Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) and Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund (Lambda) organized Regional Listening Forums in 13 different cities around the country. The objective of these events was to highlight the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth in care. The CWLA/Lambda Regional Listening Forums provided an opportunity for LGBTQ youth in care, and the adults who work with and care for them, to share their experiences and to work together to identify strategies for bringing about lasting change within the child welfare system. Out of the Margins consolidates the responses of the more than 500 youth and adult participants from 22 states who attended the Forums and offered personal stories of actual experiences and concrete solutions for building the capacity of the child welfare system to better meet the needs of LGBTQ young people in care. This report contains the following chapters: (1) Addressing Negative Attitudes About People Who Are LGBTO; (2) Safe and Supportive Placements; (3) Homeless LGBTQ Youth; (4) Community Resources and Services; (5) Issues Facing LGBTQ Youth in Schools; (6) Permanency Planning; (7) Transgender Youth; (8) Bridging the Rural -Urban Divide; (9) Faith-Based Child Welfare Service; (10) Adults Involved with the Child Welfare System; and (11) The Utility of the Regional Listening Forums for Policy, Practice, and Research: A Tripod (A.

AB  - In northern Nigeria, over 80% of the unskilled and uneducated adolescent street boys, or "Almajiris", are from the ethnic Hausa-Fulani tribes. They depend on street begging and menial jobs for daily survival. In dealing with the situation, state vocational centers were established as the Millennium Hope Project (MHP) to provide the boys with trades and skills for self-reliance and socioeconomic transformations. This article presents findings from an educational policy evaluation research study of the MHP implementation and outcomes. The research was based on an ethnographic approach using multimodal data derived from interviews and observations and data analysis-involved transcription, categorization, and coding. Major themes include the cultural identities and statuses of the boys, curriculum implementation and management of the project, socioeconomic transformation of learning outcome, and the challenges and positive impacts of the MHP on the boys. The themes are discussed using the boys' "voices" and pertinent literature. The conclusion includes educational policy remedies for future reforms and modification of the project.

AB  - An evaluation was done of New York City Public Schools' program ADVANCE (Adolescents Developing Valuable and Necessary Channels of Esteem), a U.S. Department of Education funded project that provided support to adolescents in Tier II transitional housing in Brooklyn (New York). Tier II housing provides temporary living space and on-site social services for homeless persons who have been living in shelters and have not yet been assigned to permanent housing. The program, designed to augment Tier II services, provided educational referrals, a learning center, cultural activities, and parent workshops to all community members who wished to participate from February 1, 1991, to September 30, 1991. Seventy-one adolescents and adults participated in some or all of the activities. Evaluation data were collected via a roster indicating demographic characteristics of students, pretest and posttest reading scores, educational status, number of educational referrals, and participation in project activities. Staff also administered a pretest and posttest questionnaire assessing parents' involvement in their children's education and interviewed key project workers at the site. The analysis of the data found that the project reached or surpassed its objectives in number of participants, enrollment of participants in educational institutions, and passing rate on the General Education Diploma examination.

AB  - An experience in evaluating a program which is designed to help high risk adolescents is described. The program attempts to develop basic work and social skills of adolescents (N=40) living in slums or on the streets in Brazil. Psychological and social effects of the program were assessed by means of interviews and psychological tests (Draw-a-Person, Bender Gestalt, Raven, and Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale). Results showed that, despite the risk factors, large improvements took place in test performance. Additionally, the adolescents developed more realistic life projects and positive attitudes toward school and work. Some problems of using psychological tests with this particular population are discussed. It is also pointed out that such programs cannot be successful unless they eventually provide employment opportunities or referrals. (Author/TS)

AB  - This narrative study is based on stories told by African American adolescents experiencing homelessness. It offers insights into their lived experiences and describes the challenges faced in negotiating the urban education system. African American youth are disproportionately represented in the adolescent homeless demographic. "Unheard and unseen" in the dominant narrative, the needs of this population often go unmet. The educational and social service systems frequently place barriers, and blame, that impede the academic achievement of these youth. The dominant narrative is often viewed from the perspective of "what is wrong with 'those' kids?" This research shifts the perspective to "what is occurring within the larger system?"

AB  - The Adolescent Attitude Survey (AAS) was developed and administered to 214 sixth and eighth graders, 79 from the Chicago (Illinois) Public Schools and 135 from a Chicago magnet school where subjects were more academically oriented and homogeneous. The instrument assessed the subjects' self-image, demographic variables, and factors associated with self-destructive ideation and attempts. Analysis indicated that, compared to magnet school subjects, the public school subjects reported significantly more family conflicts, exposure to suicidal models in the family peer group, depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal threats and attempts, substance abuse, and runaway behavior. Survey responses are seen as being supportive of the hypothesis that there is a significant group of "normal" adolescents who are at risk for self-destructive behaviors in association with a wide range of interpersonal conflicts and life stresses. The significant differences in AAS results betwen the public school and magnet school subejcts are seen as providing support to the hypothesis that such behaviors are differentially effected by the levels of interpersonal stress and conflict experienced by the adolescents.

AB  - Runaway youth report a broader range and higher severity of substance-related, mental health and family problems relative to non-runaway youth. Most studies to date have collected self-report data on the family and social history; virtually no research has examined treatment effectiveness with this population. This study is a treatment development project in which 124 runaway youth were randomly assigned to (1) ecologically based family therapy (EBFT) or (2) service as usual (SAU) through a shelter. Youth completed an intake, posttreatment, 6 and 12 months follow-up assessment. Youth assigned to EBFT reported greater reductions in overall substance abuse compared to youth assigned to SAU while other problem areas improved in both conditions. Findings suggest that EBFT is an efficacious intervention for this relatively severe population of youth.

AB  - In an effort to address the issue of youth homelessness in Australia, Regional Extended Family Services (REFS) have developed a wilderness-based therapeutic intervention. REFS aim to provide early intervention services for young people at risk of homelessness, and their families. This study examined the outcomes of the REFS wilderness program by looking at those factors associated closely with the risk factors of homelessness, as measured by the Life Effectiveness Questionnaire (LEQ). The results from the LEQ showed significant improvement in the overall life effectiveness of the participants. When the results of the individual programs were compared significant differences were found to exist. Observer versions of the LEQ were completed by staff from referring agencies in order to validate participant responses. The observer results were consistent with those of the participants.

AB  - This paper identifies conditions in the lives of poor urban high school students that may cause classroom management problems. Urban student teachers are urged to look at these conditions from a humanistic perspective to help them understand their students and deal effectively with those problems. Specific urban secondary classroom management problems are identified, and strategies for handling these problems are offered. Humanistic teaching means pupil-centered teaching that recognizes students as individuals, respects their differences, and tries to help them in their personal, social, emotional, and academic lives. The real difference between urban and suburban high school classroom management rests with events happening outside the classroom. The problems of students who may have to work, or who may have no time for homework, or a place to do it, or whose lives may be disrupted by homelessness or family problems, must be recognized by the urban teacher. Motivating poor urban minority students with low self-esteem to strive for academic excellence is a serious challenge for student teachers. The core of strategies for solving the problems of urban students is promoting self-esteem. (Contains 12 references.) (SLD)

AB  - Among all children under 18 years in the U.S., 41 percent are low-income children and 19 percent--approximately one in five--are poor. This means that children are overrepresented among the nation's poor; they represent 23 percent of the population but comprise 32 percent of all people in poverty. Many more children live in families with incomes just above the poverty threshold. Being a child in a low-income or poor family does not happen by chance. Parental education and employment, race/ethnicity, and other factors are associated with children's experience of economic insecurity. This fact sheet describes the demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic characteristics of children and their parents. It highlights the important factors that appear to distinguish low-income and poor children from their more advantaged counterparts.

AB  - In this study, we compared the time perspectives of runaway and nonrunaway adolescents by examining relationships among time perspective, psychological outcomes, and risky behavior within runaways. Participants included 163 runaway and 581 nonrunaway adolescents who completed a self-report survey. Several dimensions of time perspective were measured including positive and negatives attitudes, orientations, and perceived relationships regarding the past, the present, and the future. Psychological outcomes included optimism, self-esteem, and hope; risky behavior was assessed with a composite scale. Results indicated that runaway adolescents reported less positive and more negative attitudes toward time and perceived time periods as less related than nonrunaways, even after controlling for differences in maternal education and academic achievement. Findings also showed that among runaways, psychological outcomes and risky behavior were associated with time perspective dimensions in expected directions. Results are discussed in light of implications for theory on time perspective and interventions with runaways.

AB  - Children under 18 years represent 23 percent of the population, but they comprise 33 percent of all people in poverty. Among all children, 44 percent live in low-income families and approximately one in every five (22 percent) live in poor families. Being a child in a low-income or poor family does not happen by chance. Parental education and employment, race/ethnicity, and other factors are associated with children experiencing economic insecurity. This fact sheet describes the demographic, socio-economic, and geographic characteristics of children and their parents. It highlights the important factors that appear to distinguish low-income and poor children from their less disadvantaged counterparts. The following questions were addressed: (1) How many children under age 18 years in the United States live in low-income families?; (2) Has the percentage of children living in low-income and poor families changed over time?; (3) How do children compare to the rest of the population?; (4) Does the percentage of children in low-income families vary by children's age?; (5) Does the percentage of children in low-income families vary by race/ethnicity?; (6) Does the percentage of children in low-income families vary by parents' nativity?; (7) What are the family characteristics of low-income and poor children?; (8) Does the percentage of children in low-income families vary by where they live?; and (9) Are children in low-income families covered by health insurance?

AB  - Profiles of the 1995-96 implementation of the Stewart B. McKinney Act's Education for Homeless Children and Youth (EHCY) Programs in 37 states are presented in this document. In these 37 states, at least 173,082 homeless children and youth were served through programs funded by the McKinney Act, and at least 465 local education agencies received McKinney funds. Empirical evidence from the successes and persistent problems of the McKinney EHCY program offer two very important lessons. The first is that the educational needs of children and youth experiencing homelessness can only be met when these needs are addressed specifically by direct language in federal law. The second is that local education agencies and states have a difficult time providing direct services to homeless children and youth unless they receive funding targeted specifically for such services. The following recommendations are made for improving the situation of homeless children and youth in the United States: (1) maintain Federal statutes that address the education of children and youth in homeless situations; (2) fully fund the McKinney program; and (3) require the U.S. Department of Education to conduct a nationwide census of the numbers of homeless children and youth. The state profiles were developed using 1995-96 data gathered from surveys of EHCY coordinators in the 27 states that replied to the survey. The profiles show that, because of provisions in the McKinney Act, supported by a small amount of funding to each state, homeless children are receiving the academic and social support services they need to endure the trauma of homelessness. Profiles also show that homeless liaisons at local levels often collaborate with others in ways that stretch McKinney funds significantly, making the programs cost effective. A brief history of the McKinney Act is included, as are the executive summary of the previous report and a chart of effects of McKinney programs. (SLD)

AB  - This report summarizes a study conducted by the New York Family Services Project (NYFSP) of Bank Street College. The study's principal objectives were the following: (1) to document the developmental status of preschool-aged homeless children in comparison to a group of poor housed children, and the special contribution of exposure to early childhood education within both groups; (2) to document the perceived service needs of both housed and homeless families, the availability and effectiveness of those services, and the factors that may confound service delivery; and (3) to determine the interrelationships among young children's developmental status, maternal depression, characteristics of family social networks, families' perceived service needs and access to services, and housing status. The sample for the study was comprised of 160 three- , four- , and five-year-old children and their families, roughly half of whom were recruited from New York City emergency shelter facilities and half of whom were situated in some kind of permanent housing but depended on public assistance. Findings indicated few differences between homeless families living in shelters and hotels and low-income families in terms of child and family outcomes. The report includes 15 tables and 9 figures, a list of 103 references, and six appendixes. (AF)

Finds that running away was an unconstructed problem (or simmering social condition) in the early 1960s and featured harmless adventures. Contributes to the "runaway" discourse in general; and situates discourse about runaways as predecessor to that of "missing children" documented by other researchers. (SG)

AB  - Between September 2003 and December 2004, the Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) and Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund (Lambda) organized Regional Listening Forums in 13 different cities nationwide. The objective of these events was to highlight the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth in care. The CWLA/Lambda Regional Listening Forums provided an opportunity for LGBTQ youth in care, and the adults who work with and care for them, to share their experiences and work together to identify strategies for bringing about lasting change within the child welfare system. This report consolidates the responses of the more than 500 youth and adult participants from 22 states who attended the forums and offered personal stories of actual experiences and concrete solutions for building the capacity of the child welfare system to better meet the needs of LGBTQ young people in care. Following an introduction, this report is divided into the following chapters: (1) Addressing Negative Attitudes about People Who Are LGBTQ; (2) Safe and Supportive Placements; (3) Homeless LGBTQ Youth; (4) Community Resources and Services; (5) Issues Facing LGBTQ Youths in School; (6) Permanency Planning; (7) Transgender Youth; (8) Bridging the Rural-Urban Divide; (9) Faith-Based Child Welfare Services; (10) Adults Involved with the Child Welfare System; (11) The Utility of the Regional Listening Forums for Policy, Practice, and Research: A Tripod; and (12) Conclusion. Appended are: (1) Adult Invitation; (2) Youth Invitation; (3) Youth Flyer; (4) Assent Forms; and (5) Listening Forums Outline.

AB  - Growing numbers of adolescents are marginalized by social factors beyond their control, leading to poor health outcomes for their families and future generations. Although the role of the social determinants of health has been recognized for many years, there is a gap in our knowledge about the strategies needed to address these factors in health promotion. Drawing on a review of literature on health promotion for marginalized and out-of-school adolescents, this paper highlights some urgent areas of focus for researchers and policy makers addressing adolescent health. Social determinants of health affecting marginalized adolescents identified by the review were education, gender, identity, homelessness, poverty, family structure, culture, religion and perceived racism, yet there is little solid evidence as to how to best address these factors. More systematic research, evaluation and global debate about long-term solutions to chronic poverty, lack of education and social marginalization are needed to break the cycle of ill health among vulnerable adolescents.

AB  - The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) awards grants to provide shelter and services to runaway and homeless youth through the Basic Center, Transitional Living and Street Outreach Programs. In response to a mandate for a review of the grant award process for these programs in the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 (Pub. L. No. 110-378), GAO examined (1) grant announcements and application requirements, (2) technical assistance for grant applicants, (3) how grant award decisions are made, and (4) notification of grant award decisions. GAO reviewed requirements, documents, and records associated with this process for fiscal years 2007 and 2008, observed the grant evaluation portion of this process, and interviewed applicants, peer reviewers, and agency officials. HHS should take steps to ensure a fair and transparent award process, including clarifying evaluation criteria; selecting better qualified reviewers; better documenting agency guidance to reviewers and its rationale for grant decisions; and providing this rationale to applicants in a timely manner. HHS agreed to improve its process in response to all of GAO's recommendations except the ones related to clarifying evaluation criteria and better documenting agency guidance to reviewers. Three appendices are included: (1) Administration for Children and Families' Notification Letters to Grant Applicants; (2) Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families; and (3) GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments.

AB  - Youth who are homeless and gay, lesbian or bisexual (GLB) are one of the most disenfranchised and marginalized groups in our society. The purpose of this study is to examine and compare HIV in GLB homeless youth with their heterosexual counterparts. Participants for this study included 268 youth involved in treatment outcome studies with substance abusing homeless youth. Results suggest that GLB youth have greater HIV risks and that these risks are greater among bisexual females. In examining the predictors of sexual health risks, survival sex emerged as the most significant. Survival sex was high among females regardless of their sexual orientation and also among gay males. Implications of these findings suggest that a greater emphasis needs to be paid to preventive interventions among this population.

AB  - Disrupted high school experiences, including dropout, are educational consequences for many youth with histories of homelessness. Using an ecological resilience prediction model (ERPM) based on the literature on resilience in at-risk youth, the study followed 82 youth who were initially homeless for a 2-year period, to identify predictors of participating in school. Female sex and increased duration of rehousing at Time 2 significantly predicted being in school at follow-up. Youth who were not in school reported a greater increase in satisfaction with social support compared to youth who were participating in school at follow-up. The study adds to what is understood regarding the longitudinal consequences of housing instability and discontinuity in school participation in youth by examining ecological predictors of resilience. Implications of findings for policy and program development targeting education and housing for youth are discussed. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Before the start of the pandemic, Michigan's public schools identified 4,763 homeless youth living independent of parental support. These youth are homeless--living outside, in shelters, or bouncing from couch to couch. They are estranged from their parents, usually due to abuse, neglect, or parents' struggles with addiction, mental health problems, or extreme poverty. Homeless youth experience multiple negative physical, mental, and behavioral health outcomes. Early intervention is imperative since the length of homelessness compounds and increases the risks of poor health outcomes, such as suicide attempts, sexual assault, exposure to violence, and human trafficking. One critical intervention that enables unaccompanied minors to connect to services and caring adults is safe and accessible shelter. Unfortunately, only a small proportion of unaccompanied minors in Michigan are accessing emergency shelter. This brief estimates the total number and ages of high school youth who face homelessness in the state, their health risks, and use of support services in the last 12 months using data from the Michigan Department of Education, Michigan's 2018 Annual Report on Ending Homelessness, and the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). Based on this analysis it was found that the likely number of homeless unaccompanied minors in Michigan is much higher than shelter or school data suggest. Data also show that homeless youth in Michigan face much higher risks to their health and well-being and are accessing primary health care at much lower rates than their housed peers.

Of additional interest was whether having caring adult support was a protective factor in reducing the risk for high levels of distress or enhancing positive aspects of life experiences. Participants included 27,245 students (14,114 girls) in grades 7 to 12 in Western Canada. Results of logistic regression revealed that Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual youth who had experiences of being victimized were at greatest risk for social-emotional and school-related problems, including educational aspiration and activity engagement. Our results also showed that having caring support from a parent or teacher significantly contributed to reducing the likelihood of experiencing social-emotional and educational difficulties even among victimized sexual minority students as well as heterosexual youth.

AB  - A growing number of children over age 10 reside in and emancipate from foster care every year. Older children face many of the same challenges as younger children, but they also have unique developmental needs. This article discusses older children in the child welfare system and finds: (1) Approximately 47% of children in foster care are over age 11, and in 2001, 20% of children leaving foster care were over age 16; (2) Older children need permanency, stability, and a "forever family." Maintaining connections with siblings and other kin can be a crucial resource for older children as they transition to independence; and (3) Former foster children are at higher risk for a number of negative outcomes, such as substance abuse, homelessness, and low educational attainment, but the research on older youth is limited and often does not consider the strengths these youth exhibit. Much can be done to better serve older children while they are in care and to provide them with better opportunities as they transition out of the system. Programs that draw on community resources, promote a system of care, link children to mentors, and teach them life skills hold promise for improving the lives of these children. (Examples of Programs/Strategies for Serving Older Youths in Foster Care and Sources of Funds/Strategies for Helping Youths Transition from Foster Care are appended. Contains 100 endnotes.)

AB  - There is a dearth of research that examines the impact of family systems therapy on problems among sexually and/or physically abused youth. Given this void, differential outcome and predictors of substance use change were evaluated for abused, as compared with nonabused, runaway adolescents who were randomly assigned to family therapy or treatment as usual. Abused adolescents reported lower family cohesion at baseline, although both abused and nonabused adolescents showed similar substance use reductions. Utilizing hierarchical linear modeling, we found that substance use changed with change in cohesion over time. These findings link change in family functioning to change in adolescent substance use, supporting family systems theory. Findings suggest that a potent target of intervention involves focus on increasing positive communication interactions.

AB  - This study examined the relation between maternal depressive symptoms and adolescents' problem behaviors, moderated by adolescent gender, as well as the association between maternal depressive symptoms and the family environment characteristics above and beyond child variables. Data were collected from 137 mothers of runaway adolescents with alcohol and/or substance abuse problems. Results showed that both internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors of adolescent girls, as opposed to problem behaviors of boys, were significantly associated with maternal depressive symptoms. In addition, higher family cohesion was significantly related to lower maternal depressive symptoms even after controlling for adolescent problem behaviors. However, no significant relationship was found between family conflict and maternal depressive symptoms. These findings indicate that both adolescents' problem behaviors and mothers' perceptions of the family environment are associated with maternal depressive symptoms, highlighting the potential utility of the family systems theoretical framework for understanding and intervening mothers' emotional problems in the family context.

AB  - Future expectations of youth surviving on the streets of Porto Alegre, Brasil, were examined. The sample consisted of 35 boys and 34 girls aged 10-18 (M age 14.4) who participated in a sentence completion task and semi-structured interviews. Responses to two incomplete sentences regarding the future revealed a mismatch between hoped-for and expected events. When completing the sentence, ''In the future, I hope...'' the majority of youth gave optimistic (but generally non-specific) responses. In contrast, the sentence ''For me, the future...'' elicited more pessimistic responses. Few gender or age-related differences emerged. Findings are discussed in light of prior research with general populations of adolescents as well as studies of street youth. Taken as a whole, results suggest that life on the street shapes and constrains how youth see their futures. Implications of the findings for policy makers and practitioners are addressed.

AB  - The goal of this study was to extend what is currently understood regarding attitudes toward the homeless population. The study focused on how homeless and nonhomeless adolescents attribute the causes of homelessness. Grounded in attribution theory, the study hypothesized that nonhomeless adolescents would ascribe causality to dispositional or personal factors within a homeless person. Homeless adolescents, on the other hand, would causally attribute a person's state of homelessness to environmental conditions outside the person's immediate control. The samples consisted of two groups of adolescents, 61 homeless and 80 nonhomeless, ranging in age from 12 to 20 years. No differences were found at the multivariate level for the two groups along four dependent measures, two structural and two individual. Significance at the univariate level was found by group for both individual factors. A significant group and race interaction was also found on one structural factor. The literature was reviewed and further research questions were proposed. Appendixes contain the research questionnaire and a list of the dependent measures. (Contains 4 tables and 42 references.)

AB  - Extrafamilial sexual abuse experiences of young adolescents (ages 10-14), particularly young teen boys, are not well studied. This retrospective chart review study compared psychosocial correlates and victimization experiences between young adolescent girls (n = 226) and boys (n = 64) referred to a hospital child advocacy center. Several differences in risk behaviors and abuse experiences were found: Girls were more likely to have run away, to be truant from school, to report substance use, to have multiple perpetrators, and to have physical findings from the abuse. Boys were more likely to have a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder and to report anal penetration, and rarely disclosed abuse at the time of the incident. Peers were girls' most common choice for disclosing abuse, whereas boys confided most often in their mothers or other adults. These findings suggest sexually abused young adolescent girls and boys need distinct, developmentally appropriate screening and care in school and health care settings. (Contains 2 tables.)

AB  - Purpose: This randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy between the Social Enterprise Intervention (SEI) and Individual Placement and Support (IPS) with homeless youth with mental illness to assess their impact on nonvocational outcomes. Method: Seventy-two homeless youth were recruited from one agency and randomized to the SEI (n = 36) or IPS (n = 36) conditions. Over 20 months, SEI participants received four SEI components, and IPS participants received eight IPS components. Data were collected on mental health, housing, and social support outcomes at baseline and one follow-up period. Results: Findings from mixed analysis of variance indicate that both SEI and IPS participants displayed statistically significant changes in their self-esteem, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) problems, inattention problems, living in a shelter, and living in a private residence. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate the comparative efficacy and short-term nonvocational outcomes of SEI and IPS with homeless youth with mental illness. Assessment of long-term outcomes of both interventions is warranted. [Paper presented at the Stockholm Conference on Behavioral and Social Intervention Research, 11-12 May, 2017.]

AB  - Objective: This study explores prevalence and characteristics associated with supervisory neglect and physical harm in children in the child welfare system in Canada. Methods: The sample included all substantiated primary maltreatment investigations in the 2008 Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect excluding cases where exposure to intimate partner violence was the sole reason for investigation (n = 3,380). Bivariate tests were used to assess differences across types of maltreatments and to compare supervisory neglect cases with and without physical harm on factors related to child injury and supervision. Results: Supervisory neglect was the primary concern in an estimated 12,793 cases of substantiated maltreatment across Canada in 2008. Compared to other types of maltreatment, cases of supervisory neglect involved more overcrowded housing conditions and children who were younger and less likely to have any functioning issue. Injuries were noted in only 2% of cases supervisory neglect and half of these injuries were not severe enough to require medical treatment. Other physical health conditions were noted in 2% of supervisory neglect cases. Physical harm was noted most often for toddlers (1-2 years old) and adolescents (12-15 years old). Household and caregiver characteristics were not associated with greater rates of physical harm. In contrast, 7% of children with any risk factor suffered physical harm as a result of supervisory neglect mainly related to substance abuse, self-harming behavior, and multiple incidents of running from care. Conclusions: Child risk factors are often present in cases of supervisory neglect with physical harm. Nonetheless, 96% of all cases of supervisory neglect substantiated by Canadian child welfare authorities do not involve physical harm. Clearer guidelines are needed for the assessment of supervisory neglect. Alternative response systems may be more suitable for low-risk cases. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - Teen childbearing affects young people at both ends of childhood. When teens have children, their own health may be jeopardized and their chances to build productive lives are often diminished. Compared to women who postpone childbearing until they are older, teenage mothers are more likely to drop out of school and to live in poverty. At the same time, their babies are more likely than other children to be born at a low birth weight, face health problems and developmental delays, perform poorly in school, and experience abuse or neglect. As they grow older, these children are more likely to drop out of school, become teen parents themselves, and experience homelessness, juvenile delinquency, and incarceration (Healthy Teen Network, 2009; East et al., 2007). In all of these ways, teenage childbearing exacts a high cost from both individuals and society at large. This "KIDS COUNT Indicator Brief" describes six strategies that can contribute to preventing teen pregnancy. Many of the ideas outlined in this paper have been adapted from the strategies endorsed by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. These ideas are: (1) Reinvigorating prevention efforts, intensifying the focus on underlying causes; (2) Helping parents succeed in their role as sex educators; (3) Broadening the scope of pregnancy prevention efforts and addressing shifting social norms about pregnancy and parenting among unmarried women; (4) Helping adults provide accurate, clear and consistent information about how to reduce risk-taking behaviors; (5) Creating community-wide action plans for teen pregnancy prevention, including adolescent health services; and (6) Giving young people a credible vision of a positive future that takes into account current economic realities.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence of major problems in street life of people at 'risk', the case of Harari Region, Ethiopia. Participants' sex, age and level of education were taken to be variables of the study. The researcher used descriptive survey method to study the problem. Study participants were selected using snowball and purposive sampling methods, and data were also collected by using questionnaire, interview, focus group discussion, observation and document review. Data collected through questionnaire were analyzed quantitatively using descriptive statistics; and data collected through interview, focus group discussion, observation and document review were analyzed qualitatively using narration. The study revealed that the prevalence of major problems in the study area were identified as migration (20.6%), begging (15.3%), drug abuse 11.8%), commercial sex work (11%) sexual abuse/harassment (10.4%), human trafficking (10.2%), conflict and aggression (9.2%) and traditional harmful practices (8.8%). Although there were differences in some specific problems, generally, more females than males, as well as more children than youths were faced with problems in street life of people at 'risk'. Furthermore, more participants having elementary educational background than high school were also faced with problems. Study population, their families, community at large and other concerned bodies are recommended to get trainings and support in areas of conflict management, family education, community based empowerment, vocational education, advancing employment and job opportunity, rehabilitation, community health care initiatives, business education, entrepreneurship and recreational entertainment, psycho social support, and income generation initiatives.

AB  - Purpose: Our purpose in the current study was to examine the relationship between health services utilization delivered by means of the Homeless Outreach Medical Services (HOMES) program and health services utilization delivered by means of the Parkland emergency room and inpatient units among a sample of older and younger homeless adults being served by the Parkland Health and Hospital System. Design and Methods: The HOMES program uses two 40-ft-long mobile medical units and a fixed-site outpatient clinic to provide primary health care on a walk-in, no-charge basis to individuals who are homeless. We used a quasi-experimental design, and we randomly selected health services utilization data from 293 male (50.4%) and 288 female (49.6%) homeless patients from among the 14,876 homeless patients aged 20-64 years who used HOMES and the Parkland Health and Hospital System between June 1, 1992, and June 30, 1999. The dependent, variables were measurements of inpatient and outpatient utilization of psychiatric, substance abuse, and musculoskeletal services by homeless patients. Inpatient and outpatient utilization patterns by age were assessed. Data were analyzed using a split-plot repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and simple linear regression. Results: Older homeless individuals utilized the HOMES more than inpatient, services for substance abuse and musculoskeletal conditions, but they utilized inpatient services the most for psychiatric-related conditions. Implications: This level of inpatient utilization is perhaps a result, of greater severity or progression of mental illness among older homeless adults. The level of outpatient, utilization is probably because the HOMES program mitigates many of the barriers that, prevent homeless individuals from obtaining primary medical care.Key Words: Homeless person, Health service, Indigenous health services

AB  - Differential predictors of the educational achievement status of homeless children were studied using multivariate statistical modeling. The effects of more general influences such as age, gender, and maternal educational level were studied before the influence of intellectual, behavioral, and emotional factors was examined. Participants were families of 127 homeless children receiving services in a comprehensive health care program for homeless children in Baltimore (Maryland). Results of the study provide support for age, gender, and maternal educational level as important predictors of academic achievement in school-aged homeless children and adolescents. Overall cognitive functioning, however, was the most salient predictor of academic performance. This finding suggests that the depressed cognitive functioning found in homeless and disadvantaged children is an important focus for remedial efforts. Emotional distress and behavioral problems were significant contributors to academic achievement levels beyond background and cognitive factors, and should also be targets for efforts to improve academic achievement and learning potential. Characteristics of homelessness such as residential instability and the level of major life stressors did not account for significant proportions of the variance in academic achievement.

AB  - This article reports on results of a one-day public health survey conducted in six states by homeless youth providers to measure and compare risk factors between lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) homeless youth and non-LGB homeless youth. This article intends to inform the child welfare field on existing gaps in services and areas where more training and technical support is necessary in providing services to homeless LGB youth. The findings point to substantial differences within the homeless youth sample and demonstrate that in addition to the public health risks young people face merely by being homeless, the risks are exacerbated for those who self-identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. The article informs child welfare providers and policymakers about the substantial vulnerability of LGB youth beyond that of non-LGB homeless youth and the need to fund programming, training, technical assistance and further research to specifically respond to the complex needs of this population.

AB  - For 3.5 years, North Carolina has conducted a randomized experimental program designed to provide intensive supervision services for undisciplined youths (status offenders) placed under the protective supervision of the juvenile courts. Updated results from an ongoing systematic evaluation of the project indicate that, for undisciplined youths with no prior history of court referrals for delinquent acts, the Intensive Protective Supervision Program provides a reduction of 15 to 20 percent in the rate of progression to delinquent offenses during the supervision period and a cumulative (supervision period plus up to one year after supervision) reduction of 25 to 30 percent relative to the corresponding rates observed for youths in regular protective supervision. Experimental results also indicate: that early intervention (i.e., for status offenders who have not yet been referred to the courts for delinquent acts) facilitates reduction in subsequent delinquent behavior; that the reduction occurs primarily in referrals for nonfelony delinquent offenses; that there also are intensive supervision effects on reducing the runaway and truancy offense recidivism rates; that intensive supervision has a longer lasting (post-supervision period) effect than regular supervision; that measurement scales can be developed for predicting which characteristics of a youth client and her/his family are likely to lead to success in the intensive supervision program; and that, for the continuing effectiveness of intensive supervision, it may be essential to provide counselors with periodic morale-boosting attention and training in counseling and therapeutic methods to guard against the possibility of counselor burnout.

AB  - An extensive review of the adolescent runaway literature indicated inconsistent findings regarding the presence, severity, and chronicity of psychopathological behavior among this high-risk group. Three experiments were conducted to address these issues using one personality measure, the Personality Inventory for Children (PIC). The results of the first experiment indicated that the PIC Typology was able to correctly classify over 93% of the runaway subjects with identified psychopathologies of Conduct Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Adjustment Disorder, Major Depression, Dysthymia, Organic Brain Syndrome, Pervasive Developmental Disorder, and Developmental Disorders. No subjects were identified as Within-Normal-Limits. Experiment Two indicated that the runaway group was not significantly different from an outpatient sample or from a Day Treatment Program (partial hospitalization) sample. Both clinical samples evidenced increasing severity of psychopathology. The third experiment indicated that the runaway group was not significantly different from a sample diagnosed Conduct Disorder on 11 scales of the PIC. The results of this study support the utility of the PIC as an initial screening measure only and for identifying the degree of psychological dysfunction that runaways and their families may be experiencing.

AB  - Adolescence is an important period of physical, social, psychological, and cognitive growth. No longer children and not yet adults, adolescents make significant choices about their health and develop attitudes and health behaviors that continue into adulthood. Substance use disorders among adolescents can impede the attainment of important developmental milestones, including the development of autonomy, the formation of intimate interpersonal relationships, and general integration into adult society. Similarly, the use of alcohol and illicit substances by youth often leads to adverse health outcomes. This paper presents: (1) facts about adolescent substance use; (2) factors that make monitoring and decreasing adolescent substance use especially difficult; and (3) recommendations for preventing adolescent substance use.

AB  - Children and youth who experience homelessness face many barriers to education, yet school can be a source of stability, affirmation, and hope during a time of chaos and trauma when a young person loses his or her housing. Community service providers play a key role in linking homeless children and youth to schools and providing wraparound services that can bolster their attendance and educational success. This brief provides important information to service providers on Subtitle VII-B of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act [42 U.S.C. §§ 11431-11435], reauthorized in 2001 by Title X, Part C of the No Child Left Behind Act1 (subsequently referred to in this brief as the McKinney-Vento Act). The McKinney-Vento Act ensures educational rights and protections for homeless children and youth. This brief will enable service providers to understand: (1) which children are eligible under the definition in the law; (2) what rights and services school districts provide; (3) how the law is implemented in school districts, and (4) how community agencies and school districts can coordinate services for homeless children and youth more effectively.

AB  - Services for homeless youth traditionally provided shelter and nourishment but do little to break the cycle of homelessness. A more comprehensive approach to serve homeless youth is the drop-in center model that provides safe and easy-to-find facilities within communities to bridge the gap between the streets and transitional/permanent housing. Research describing homeless youth who utilize drop-in centers is lacking. This study examines characteristics/preferences of 96 homeless adolescents attending one of two drop-in centers in Southern California. Homeless youth reported high prevalence of risk behaviors regardless of the center of attendance. Furthermore, our analyses revealed significant differences related to demographics, sexual risk behaviors, and substance use between homeless youth at the two drop-in centers. These findings illuminate the specific characteristics and preferences of homeless youth who attend drop-in centers and can be used to inform providers, advocates, and policy makers.

AB  - The safest place for children should be their own home and family, but the facts place this assumption in doubt. According to data of Russian statistics, 2,000-2,500 children die every year as a result of domestic violence; about 2 million minor children up to the age of fourteen are beaten by their parents, more than 50,000 children run away from home every year to avoid abuse, 25,000 of them are being sought by the authorities, about 2,000 take their own lives every year, more than 50 percent of domestic crimes are committed in the presence of children, and 30-40 percent of all crimes of violence in Russia are committed in the home. The number of homeless children in Russia, now 3-4 million, is rising. This article discusses violence directed against children, yet so far, specialists have not seen situations involving children as witnesses as situations that have the potential for professional intervention. And yet children who, for example, have witnessed abuse by their father against their mother suffer from what is called "secondary victimization." They also have an inclination to engage in aggressive behavior in their childhood and when they become adolescents. The results of surveys conducted in the United States have shown that in families where women have been the victims of violence by their husbands, the children also become the objects of abuse (from 30-60 percent of families). These data are also backed up by Russian surveys. Children's reactions to violence differ depending on their age, gender, and social support offered to them. But the children who are witnesses to violence as well as the objects of abuse have the most serious behavioral problems. The mass media, the police, social workers, sociologists, psychologists, social educators, medical personnel, institutions, and civil society can and must put up a united front against the abuse of children.

AB  - This study applies cumulative adversity and stress proliferation theories to examine risk and protective resource profiles of youth with three different levels of housing and parental care instability. Data derive from a state representative sample (n=27,087) of school-based adolescent students. ANCOVA analyses identified significant differences in sociodemographic and psychosocial functioning variables for youth with 0, 1, or 2 forms of housing and parental care instability, with more deleterious functioning being observed among youth with greater levels of instability. Those experiencing either or both housing and parental care instability are more represented by males, sexual minorities, and youth of color; psychosocial risk and protective factors demonstrated consistent differences between instability groups. Dimensions of cumulative adversity operate with social marginalities (e.g., race, sexual minority status) relative to instability, with higher frequency of victimization, lower grades, diminished self-regulation capabilities and school engagement, weakened psychological health, and strained family and peer relationships. The paper discusses theorized mechanisms through which cumulative adversity conveys effects as well as implications for social work prevention and resilience-fostering strategies in schools and other youth-serving settings.

AB  - The connection between parental alcohol abuse and adolescent life stress, adolescent alcohol abuse and adolescent running away is explored in this study of 907 adolescents ranging in age from 12-17. The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not alcohol abuse and running away can be viewed as a response to, or an escape from stress. It is reported that the majority of runaways say they left home because of family problems, including parental alcohol abuse. A population of two groups, runaway and non-runaway, was used in this study to test for a correlation between parental alcohol abuse and adolescent running away. A questionnaire was administered to the entire population of 907 adolescents and a Life Events Inventory (LEI) was administered to a sub-sample of these adolescents. Final analysis of the questionnaire data supported positive correlations between adolescent alcohol abuse, running away and parental alcohol abuse. The analysis also showed similarities in drinking patterns for runaways and non-runaways. The results indicated, however, that despite many similar characteristics between runaways and non-runaways, differences existed between these two groups. It was found that parental alcohol use/abuse is one of the most significant factors in adolescents's drinking. (RLV)

AB  - Poverty and economic hardship remain a reality for many of America's children. Although the causes of poverty are varied, Americans strongly endorse individual responsibility as a primary cause. Because beliefs about poverty originate in childhood and adolescence, intervention efforts targeting young people may be particularly effective in shifting attitudes about the poor and policies designed to help the disadvantaged. To test this proposition, the current study evaluated the efficacy of a 1-week 8th grade social studies curriculum focusing on poverty and inequality. Study participants were upper middle-class youth enrolled in multiple sections of a Social Studies course taught by a single teacher. Participants had little direct contact with marginalized groups such as poor and homeless individuals in their communities. Students (N = 66) completed a survey assessing their attitudes and beliefs about poverty and poor people prior to, and 1 week and 6 months post-instruction. Results indicated that the curriculum was partially effective in increasing the complexity of students' beliefs about poverty. Students were more likely to emphasize fatalistic causes and less likely to list individualistic causes for poverty following instruction than before, but rarely emphasized structural causes for poverty and rated individual effort as the most influential factor in determining one's success. Implications of the study findings for curriculum efforts targeting young adolescents' reasoning about economic inequality and inequity and directions for future studies are discussed.

AB  - "Kids Count in Colorado!" is an annual publication of the Colorado Children's Campaign, which provides the best available state- and county-level data to measure and track the education, health and general well-being of the state's children. "Kids Count in Colorado!" informs policy debates and community discussions, serving as a valuable resource for policymakers, community leaders, advocates and citizens. This report, "The Big Picture: Taking the Whole Child Approach to Child Well-Being," highlights issues impacting kids that overlap policy areas. The report makes connections between the Children's Campaign's longstanding issues areas--early childhood, health and K-12 education--with the hope that in these areas lie solutions to some of the state's most troubling and stubborn trends. The report offers the data that policy makers, child advocates and community leaders need to make informed decisions about children in their communities. This year, attention si brought to the ways that health, education and early childhood experiences interact to affect a child's opportunities: how having health coverage helps ensure children are healthy enough to attend school regularly, for example, or how a high school diploma impacts a young adult's chances at achieving economic security. The hope is that looking at these issues through this lens of interconnectedness will help policy makers, advocates and parents discover new ways to address the some of the troubling trends in child well-being detailed in this report.

AB  - The objective of the study is to use social network analysis to examine the acceptability of a youth-led, hybrid face-to-face and online social networking HIV prevention program for homeless youth. Seven peer leaders (PLs) engaged face-to-face homeless youth (F2F) in the creation of digital media projects (e.g. You Tube videos). PL and F2F recruited online youth (OY) to participate in MySpace and Facebook communities where digital media was disseminated and discussed. The resulting social networks were assessed with respect to size, growth, density, relative centrality of positions and homophily of ties. Seven PL, 53 F2F and 103 OY created two large networks. After the first 50 F2F youth participated, online networks entered a rapid growth phase. OY were among the most central youth in these networks. Younger aged persons and females were disproportionately connected to like youth. The program appears highly acceptable to homeless youth. Social network analysis revealed which PL were the most critical to the program and which types of participants (younger youth and females) may require additional outreach efforts in the future.

The first group attended agencies in low-income Hispanic neighborhoods which recruited within the locale. The second group of youth attended agencies that recruited based upon a specific population--they targeted homeless and LGBQ youth. We explored the characteristics of adolescents who sought initial services, the types of services requested, and attitudes toward the centers. Results indicated that those who utilized the population-based agencies were more likely to be homeless, have higher depression scores, and be older. They reported coming to the agency to find a safe place, whereas those who utilized the neighborhood-based agencies came specifically for concrete services. Implications are discussed.

AB  - This study collected information on girls in San Francisco, California in the areas of demographics, economics, education, health, safety and violence, and criminal justice. Data came from local, state, and national sources (e.g., the U.S. Census Bureau; the California Bureau of Justice and the Criminal Statistics Center; the California Department of Education; and the California Department of Health Services; the San Francisco Unified School District; the San Francisco Housing Authority; and the San Francisco Department of Human Services). Findings highlight how few and diverse San Francisco girls are. San Francisco has the smallest percent of youth of any California county, and in 2000, San Francisco girls numbered about 55,000. Approximately 79 percent of all girls age 10-17 are girls of color, 7 percent of girls live in poverty, and 10 percent of public high school girls are lesbian, bisexual, or sexual orientation unknown. Most girls graduate high school. However, in 2002, most high school girls taking the California High School Exit Exam failed. San Francisco's girls face complex social and environmental challenges that affect their physical and mental wellbeing. Rates of sexually transmitted diseases are much higher for girls than boys. Most girls are dissatisfied with their weight and not meeting fitness standards. Most girls do not take drugs. High numbers report being depressed. Minority girls are disproportionately represented in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems. A list of online statistical resources is appended.(Contains over 300 footnotes and 113 figures.)

AB  - This book explores the U.S. gang problem, based on the author's 35 years of experience as a high school and junior high school teacher, principal, and community organizer in Oakland and Los Angeles (California). Chapters discuss the subculture of gang worlds, reasons why youth are attracted to gangs, how educators can reach out to students, the hold that gangs have on members, the role of important others in adolescent development, classroom climate, the importance of the learning climate in gang membership attraction, the importance of an atmosphere of safety to discourage gang formation, and the role of community school settings. Gangs are the result of urban decay, poverty, discrimination, family disorganization, cultural differences, social class resentments, and dislocation. Gang members generally are children growing up in neighborhoods where youth gangs are rampant, and where turf wars, trade wars, drugs, homeless children, guns, and cynical values prevail. Many gang members are moved by their desires to overcome the feared experience of personal failure, and others join gangs through intimidation and desire for social status. Gangs are emerging into powerful economic, political, and quasi-military forces, with the ability to corrupt judges, police officers, legitimate businesses, family life, and schools. Schools can reduce the attractiveness of gangs by promoting the "bonding" of students to teachers, classrooms, schools, and their communities while preparing students with the knowledge, skills, and values for making healthy choices.

AB  - Most of what we know about sexual abuse comes from efforts to examine female children victimized by men. Although some researchers have identified similarities between male and female victims of sexual abuse, few studies have examined gender-specific factors associated with sexual health practices among homeless adolescents. The aim of this study was to explore how gender and history of sexual abuse influence cognitive-perceptual and behavioral factors associated with sexual health practices of homeless adolescents. This study was a secondary analysis of data collected for a cross-sectional study of the sexual health practices of homeless adolescents. The sample consisted of 414 youths (104 males who reported sexual abuse and 124 who did not; and 95 females who reported sexual abuse and 75 who did not; 16 did not provide these data). Homeless adolescent females with a history of sexual abuse scored higher (indicating a shorter perspective) on a measure of future time perspective than females with no sexual abuse. Males who reported no sexual abuse scored higher than abused females on perceived health status and higher than abused males on assertive communication. With respect to perceived health status, males who reported no sexual abuse scored significantly higher than females who reported sexual abuse (p = 0.04). Males with no sexual abuse had significantly higher assertive communication scores than did males who had experienced sexual abuse (p = 0.015). We found that male and female abuse victims differ in terms of their cognitive-perceptual and behavioral factors associated with sexual health practices. Early identification of those who have been abused is critical so that interventions can be developed. Effective shortterm interventions are needed for the adolescent victims of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA), particularly those who are homeless and prone to further sexual victimization.

AB  - This presentation describes dropout facts and prevention methods based on nationwide interviews with dropout runaways. Potential dropout runaways might be labeled the "distracted ones." They have trouble concentrating in a typical classroom situation as they are distracted by events that happened at home or that might happen after school. Such events might include domestic violence, neglect, or physical, emotional, or sexual abuse. The cost to the nation of dropout runaways is fourfold: (1) they drop out of school before they learn acceptable marketable skills; (2) their potential contributions to society are lost; (3) they resort to unacceptable illegal means of survival; and (4) they drain the resources of educational, social, health, and correctional agencies. Survival is the primary goal of these youth in crisis. Only if school and education are seen as a high priority for survival will they sustain concentration and block their distractions. Direct-contact educators can make the difference. This report outlines: (1) 40 common characteristics of dropout runaways, (2) the choices such youth might make for survival, (3) warning signs that a youth is about to run, and (4) 40 possible actions an educator might take as preventive or remedial techniques. Workshop materials include case histories of dropout runaways and how their lives turned out, and specific instructions to guide educators in developing relationships with such youth. (SV)

AB  - This book presents a theoretical rationale for youth involvement in community service. Its thesis is that youth participation in solving social problems has the potential to promote the development of personal and collective identity. Through community service, youth can acquire a sense that they can make a difference and a concern for society's welfare. The book is based on a qualitative study of the 1993-94 junior class of a Catholic high school in Washington, D.C. with a predominantly African-American student body. The researchers followed these students as they progressed through a required course on social justice in which service at a soup kitchen was a mandatory ane essential part. The book reports the results of the study, especially through anecdotes of discussions with the students and excerpts from their essays. The study demonstrates the following: volunteer work can be a key building block of self-development in youth; the youth learned much about homelessness and society and the political processes involved; and they changed their values and became more mature and caring people. The book contains 140 references. (KC)

AB  - This paper describes a tool-and-result methodological approach to the practice and evaluation of an urban community development and gardening project with homeless youth. Over 9 months, at least 40 homeless children and teenagers were involved in the program, and approximately 15 were core participants. The paper critically examines the role of evaluation and assessment with a transient population and discusses how these methods helped to transform leaving into an opportunity to celebrate Public history. As young people engaged in community development and gardening, the collective history was documented through photographs, video, writings, drawings, and interviews. In this context, the documentation of the collective history served both as an artifact to leave behind and memorabilia to take forward. As youth and adults created the tools of the evaluation simultaneously with the project, the evaluation tools became part of the result. The paper addresses the conceptual and theoretical framework of tool-and-result methodology, its challenge to Western scientific frameworks, and its effectiveness for transforming environments of learning and development and empowering those who transform them.

AB  - The Hamden Mental Health Service staff collaborated with the police on a joint research project concerning runaway youth. The data suggest that adolescents who run away come from broken homes where disruption during preadolescence has been associated with parental separation and remarriage. These adolescents often exhibit symptoms of depression and impulsive behavior. Many adolescents run away primarily to escape from home, to experiment with their own autonomy, or to manipulate their parents into effecting changes which would make the relationship more satisfactory. Through planning, implementing, and interpreting this preliminary study, the community has benefited in the following areas: (1) operational and training procedures in the police department have been systematized and upgraded; (2) interagency cooperation has been promoted; and (3) service for adolescents and their families has been improved.

AB  - Objectives: The prevalence rates of disorders among a community-based sample of Hawaiian youths were determined and compared to previously published epidemiological studies. Method: Using a two-phase design, 7,317 adolescents were surveyed (60% participation rate), from which 619 were selected in a modified random sample during the 1992-1993 to 1995-1996 school years: 590 selected randomly and 29 at risk (i.e., Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression score of [greater than or equal to] 35 and suicidal risk) from grades 9-12. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Version 2.3, was used to determine DSM-III-R diagnoses. Prevalence rates, weighted for ethnicity, Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scores, and suicide attempts, were calculated for any diagnosis and various disorders. Meta-analyses compared the Hawai'i sample to four community-based studies (randomly selected youths from community populations) and two high-risk studies (homeless, low-income, or high unemployment communities). Results: Hawaiian females had the highest rate for any diagnosis (37.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 28.4%-48.0%) and non-Hawaiian males had the lowest rate (19.6%; 95% CI 14.8%-25.5%). Hawaiian males (26.8%; 95% CI 18.2%-37.5%) and non-Hawaiian females (27.9%; 95% CI 22.2%-34.4%) had intermediate and comparable rates. Overall, Hawaiians had significantly higher rates (32.7%; 95% CI 26.1%-40.1%) than non-Hawaiians (23.7%; 95% CI 19.9%-28.0%) when controlling for gender, and girls had significantly higher rates (30.8%; 95% CI 25.8%-36.3%) than boys (21.1%; 95% CI 16.8%-26.1%) when controlling for ethnicity. These findings were primarily the result of the significant differences in rates regarding anxiety disorders. Meta-analyses showed the Hawaiian youth rate for any diagnosis was comparable to high-risk studies and nearly three times higher than the community studies. Conclusions: Hawaiian youths, especially females, are at high risk. Research on the sociocultural factors that underpin both the genesis of and protection from psychopathology is imperative for Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian mixed-ethnicity youths. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - The current study longitudinally examines the effects of child maltreatment, parenting, and disadvantaged neighborhood on victimization, delinquency, and well-being via running away and school engagement among a sample of 360 high-risk adolescents. Results of a path analysis revealed that parenting was associated with school engagement, running away, and well-being. Childhood neglect was related to victimization while sexual abuse and living in a more disadvantaged neighborhood were associated with poorer well-being. Greater school engagement was associated with higher levels of well-being and a lower likelihood of delinquency. Finally, running away was positively associated with participating in delinquent activities. In terms of the interactions, results showed that the effect of positive parenting on well-being was significantly stronger for females and the manner in which neglect related to school engagement was greater among males. Additionally, gender significantly moderated the relationship between running away and victimization and between running away and delinquency, both of which the effects were significantly stronger for males. Implications for families and adolescents are addressed.

AB  - Public concern for children has become more visible during the last decade as awareness of child abuse and neglect has increased. It is difficult to design policies to deal with troubled youth who run away. Because families of runaways are often looked upon as failures, there is a reluctance among families to report the runaway. Families may not define leaving home without permission as runaway behavior. Statistical estimates of runaways are difficult because of timing of the estimates, survey bias, and political trends. This study attempted to estimate the number of runaways and determine the type of services they and their families receive in Texas. A questionnaire was completed by 1,022 Texas households having children between the ages of 10 and 17. Respondents provided demographic, runaway, and social service information. The results showed that approximately two percent of the households (N=19) reported a runaway incident. Racial percentages of runaways resembled the state's racial composition. The median income of families reporting runaways was higher than the state average, suggesting that the poorest families were not necessarily experiencing the most runaway behavior. The survey did not generate information about the need for new services for runaways and their families. Several types of youth can be classified as runaways. Some children leave home of their own choosing, others are asked to leave by their parents, and others leave to escape abuse or neglect. A general survey on runaways will not reveal these different populations or their respective needs for services. The survey questionnaire and tables of results are included. (ABL)

AB  - This study compares hope in street youth, former street youth, and school youth (aged 12-18) in Tanzania. Responding to Snyder's hope theory, the author argues that not only personal agency but also the stability of living context (street, shelter, home) shapes hopefulness. Employing qualitative and quantitative analyses, the author presents a framework that shows considerable differences by youth group in hope conceptualizations. Youth in unstable environments avoid hope to circumvent failure and instead attribute success to luck and other external factors, whereas youth in steadier environments rely on internal resources, seeing themselves as critical agents in engendering hopefulness. Taking youths' differing living contexts into account, the author proposes a contextual model of hope that consists of "hope instruments," "hope outcomes," and "pathways to hopefulness."

AB  - This guide is intended to help church congregations develop and/or strengthen plans for children's ministries and child advocacy. Specifically the work aims to affirm children's growth, discoveries, and experiences and to provide strategies to congregations for helping children whose physical, emotional, social, economic, and educational conditions are depriving them of the opportunity to develop their God-given potential. Following an introduction on the need for such advocacy, section one of the guide explores "Looking at Children through the Eyes of Faith" by means of sermons, Bible study, reflection, prayers, poems, stories, and song. This section also provides examples of children in the Bible and suggestions for children's Sabbath and children's day celebrations. Section two urges, "Making a Difference for Children--Step By Step," and details nine steps for involving a congregation in helping children. Section three provides a four-part format for a "study into action program" and areas for focus such as child care, Head Start, education, vulnerable children and families, homelessness, housing, maternal health, child health, youth development, teen pregnancy prevention, and family income issues. Section four is entitled, "Children of Every Nation," and focuses on providing a global perspective on children's issues. Section five, "Giving Voice to the Voiceless," guides users in advocating for children in the political arena. Included are descriptions of policies and programs vital to children's interests, and effective methods of communication with government officials. Section six provides resources to aid in the fight to help children, including congregational model programs, national faith-based efforts, faith-based public policy organizations, and sources of information for specific issues affecting children.

AB  - The usefulness of the Preschool Preposition Test (PPT) as a cognitive screening and diagnostic tool for handicapped children is demonstrated through results of eight independent studies. The subjects were 354 children and youths, aged two to 20 years, with various handicaps: mentally retarded, autistic-like, moderately emotionally disturbed, severely emotionally disturbed, homeless institutionalized, and physically handicapped. The PPT showed statistically significant correlations with other cognitive measures including the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Columbia Mental Maturity Scale and Carrow Auditory Test of Language Comprehension. Ratings by teachers on the Classroom Behavior Description Checklist did not correlate with PPT scores, but ratings of mothers' stimulation and nurturance behavior did. When PPT mean scores for the handicapped children were compared with those of the normal standardization sample, scores for the handicapped children were lower at every chronological age except for the emotionally disturbed samples. The PPT has special value for testing otherwise untestable children on abstract thinking and spatial reasoning, for development of new prescriptive programs, and as an added dimension in decisions for special education placement.

AB  - Despite the recent dramatic rise in student homelessness in the U.S., little research evidence exists on the effects of homelessness programs and interventions on students and young people. This paper examines the effects of a homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing program--which combines temporary rental subsidies with light-touch case management--on homeless and highly mobile students in a large urban school district. By linking detailed district administrative data with programmatic data, I create a novel dataset that allows me to estimate impacts to students in the immediate weeks and months following exposure to the rehousing intervention. Specifically, I use generalized and event study difference-in-differences models to estimate within-student differences in district and school mobility, attendance, and behavioral outcomes before and after beginning participation in the program. I find that the treatment improves student behavior, significantly reducing the likelihood of students having multiple behavioral incidents in a month, but increases students' absence rates and chronic absenteeism, particularly for students who are rehoused outside the city proper but remain enrolled in the central district. These results highlight both the positive impacts of this type of intervention, as well as unintended consequences, raising questions around the priorities and inherent tradeoffs of rehousing programs.

Number 1 highlights the challenges facing gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth in schools. Many schools have nothing in their curricula to help provide an understanding of these issues due to the politics and cultural misunderstandings of sexual identity. Number 2 focuses on teenage tobacco use, an important public health concern. It contains an overview of the prevention strategies that have attempted to discourage youth tobacco use and explains the social influence model that entices youth to regular smoking is explained. Volume 3 looks at the prevalence and history of homeless youth. It includes an examination of the educational needs of middle school homeless youth. Number 4 considers many issues surrounding teenage depression including how to recognize it; the impact of race identity on depression; gender differences; risk factors; and resilience. The annual supplement features a question and answer session on the topic of teenage self injurious behavior. It also contains book reviews and numerous web resources and publications.

AB  - Founded in response to the needs of children left homeless in Italy in the wake of World War II, Boys' and Girls' Towns have become international communities of children and adolescents separated from their families or homelands because of domestic violence, famine, war or other forms of social upheaval. The towns have been less subject to many of the trends in social policy that significantly transformed and eventually closed most of the larger institutions for homeless children Challenged with responsibility for themselves and for the building up of the community, the young people of the towns have produced a constitutional government which continues to evolve; a financial system with taxes, savings accounts, fines and unemployment insurance; a judicial system with trials, a penal code, bar exams, lawyers, and public defenders; and commissioners of public works, sanitation, and labor. Based on personal observation, this paper presents a psychological perspective on the Boys' Town of Rome's citizens response to the numerous challenges they face, and invites reflection on their capacity to be agents in their own development. Examples are presented to illustrate forms of motivation related to propriate striving, personal causation, Locus of Control, perceived self-efficacy, resiliency, and agency. A detailed "Gradient of Belonging" is appended. Contains 16 references. (RB)

AB  - We examined the associations among gender, antisocial behavior, and peer-group affiliation in a high-risk sample of 401 homeless and matched housed adolescents (139 boys and 262 girls). The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (Version 2.3, 1991; Costello, Edelbrock, Kalas, Kessler, & Klaric, 1982) yielded 2 measures of adolescent antisocial behavior: symptoms of conduct disorder and substance abuse or dependence. Various deviant behaviors of friends were assessed based on adolescent self-report. Results indicated that, for both boys and girls, having many deviant peers was associated with more antisocial behavior, regardless of the number of boys in the peer network. Furthermore, findings suggest that the relation between number of deviant peers and antisocial behavior may be stronger for boys and homeless adolescents than for girls and housed adolescents, respectively. The results of prior studies indicating that antisocial behavior is a function of affiliation with male peers may be due to the higher frequencies of maladaptive behaviors evidenced in boys in normative samples.

AB  - Over 1.5 million students in the United States experience homelessness. These students are entitled to educational support through the Education for Homeless Children and Youth program. However, many homeless students are not identified and therefore never receive this support. Across 1,732 local education agencies in New Jersey, New Mexico, and New York, we conducted a randomized controlled trial of increased email communication incorporating behavioral insights targeting homeless liaison staff in order to increase the identification of homeless students. The intervention had an impact on the mean number of identified homeless students among the treatment local education agencies (3.62, 90% CI [0.32, 6.92], p = 0.07). The impact remained when outliers with high leverage were removed (1.51 CI [0.24, 2.79], p = 0.05). Within this sample, our analysis indicates that more than 3,000 additional homeless students were identified with a low-cost, low-intensity, behavioral intervention during the second semester.

AB  - This study investigated the stresses confronting homeless adolescents and the coping strategies that enable stressed urban minority children to achieve in school. A total of 176 homeless children ranging in age from 9 to 14 years were interviewed, and 199 control subjects who were not homeless were surveyed. Academic achievement was determined from achievement test scores. Several instruments measured children's coping strategies and social relationships, especially the Adolescent Coping Inventory based on the adult scale created by Folkman and Lazarus (1986). The five coping strategies described in this paper are: (1) reappraising in a positive manner; (2) seeking social support; (3) distancing; (4) confronting; and (5) self-blaming. Results indicated that homeless children were more likely to focus on interpersonal conflicts and environmental stresses than were housed children. Homeless children used positive reappraisal more often for school problems than for other problems. Nonachievers reported more interpersonal conflicts than achievers. Compared to achievers, nonachievers were more likely to use positive reappraisal, distancing, and confronting, and were more likely to seek social support. Girls did not have lower levels of interpersonal conflict than boys. Girls used more confrontive coping strategies than boys did to deal with interpersonal difficulties. Youngsters with an external locus of control used more positive reappraisal and confronting strategies than did youngsters with an internal locus of control. A reference list of 19 items is provided.

AB  - The purpose of this ethnographic study was to examine friendships of early adolescents in a culturally diverse fifth grade class in an urban elementary school in the southeastern United States. The study described and interpreted the experiences of being a friend and having a friend in a culturally diverse classroom. The approach was grounded in symbolic interactionist theory; executed with ethnographic procedures; and guided by constant comparison analysis. Findings indicated that children's friendships were established through frequently rehearsed low verbal protocols. Children negotiated their friendships through strategic adaptation to the parameters of togetherness, being nice, not fighting, and circumvention. Friends were described inclusively rather than exclusively. Friends were described primarily by gender, and across race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status features. Emergent cultural dissonance related to drugs, transiency, and being a runaway acutely affected children's friendships. A list of 61 references is included. (Author)

AB  - Objectives: To identify the incidence of self-reported physical and sexual child abuse among homeless youth, the self-perceived effects of past abuse, and current interest in treatment for past abuse among homeless youth with histories of abuse. Methods: Homeless and street-involved persons aged 18-23 filled out a questionnaire and participated in a structured assessment of histories of abuse, tobacco use and substance abuse. Results: Sixty-four homeless youth in Salt Lake City, Utah completed the study, 43 males and 21 females. Eighty-four percent screened positive for childhood physical and/or sexual abuse occurring before the age of 18; 42% screened positive for both physical and sexual abuse; 72% reported still being affected by their abuse. Among all abuse victims, 44% were interested in treatment for their abuse history and 62% of homeless youth who reported still being affected by their abuse were interested in treatment. Individuals were more likely to be interested in treatment if they were female, had not completed high school or had been previously asked about family dysfunction. Many victims who declined treatment offered spontaneous insight into their decision. Interest in treatment was similar to interest in treatment for other behaviors such as smoking and substance abuse. Conclusions: Histories of abuse are common among homeless youth. A majority of those reporting a history of abuse are still affected by their abuse. Interest in treatment for a history of abuse was comparable to interest in treatment for other morbidities in the homeless youth population such as tobacco use and substance abuse. Our finding that homeless youth continue to be impacted by their abuse and are interested in treatment should prompt more screening for histories of abuse. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)

Participants had good HIV knowledge. Case managers perceived client youth to be at high risk for HIV infection due to unsafe sexual practices, survival sex, vulnerability to victimization, and homelessness. Teenaged girls were seen as being at higher risk than teenage boys. Clients with stable placements and involved caregivers were deemed at lower risk due to increased emotional and behavioral support. Few case managers provided HIV prevention services due to strained resources, insufficient training, and difficulty talking about sexuality. Implications for prevention are discussed.

AB  - Establishing coordination among schools, families, and communities has emerged as a major policy issue in the debate over the quality of education and how the restructuring of education should be accomplished. This book explores coordination of services for children and youth between and among schools, families, and community groups and agencies, as one process for dealing with the broad set of educational and social problems. The articles in the book are divided into three parts: models of coordination, organizational and management issues, and evaluation and critiques of coordination as a reform. Following an introduction by William Kritek which examines the impetus for renewed interest in coordination and its role in school reform, the article titles are: (1) "The Kentucky Family Resource Centers: The Challenges of Remaking Family-School Interactions" (Claire Smrekar); (2) "Visible Differences and Unseen Commonalities" (H. Dickson Corbet and others); (3) "Conflict and Consensus" (Paul Heckman and others); (4) "The Best of Both Worlds" (Shirley Brice Heath and Milbrey McLaughlin); (5) "Educating Homeless Children" (Rebecca Newman and Lynn Beck); (6) "Structure and Strategies: Toward an Understanding of Alternative Models for Coordinated Children's Services" (Robert Crowson and William Lowe Boyd); (7) "The Principal and Community-School Connections in Chicago's Radical Reform" (Mark Smylie and others); (8) "Schools as Intergovernmental Partners" (Carolyn Herrington); (9) "Institutional Effects of Strategic Efforts at Community Enrichment" (Hanne Mawhinney); (10) "School-Business-University Collaboratives" (Patrick Galvin); (11) "Reforming American Education Policy for the Twenty-First Century" (Deborah Verstegen); (12) "We're Not Housed in an Institution, We're Housed in the Community" (Colleen Capper); (13) "Schools and Community Connections" (Gail Chase Furman and Carol Merz); (14) "Connecting Schools and Communities through Interagency Collaboration for School-Linked Services" (Debra Shaver and others); (15) "Beyond Consensus: Mapping Divergent Views of Systems and Power in Collaboratives" (Maureen McClure and others). A concluding article, "Toward an Interpretation of School, Family, and Community Connections: Policy Challenges" (James Cibulka) is included. Each of the articles contains notes and or references.

AB  - This report documents a history of unintended pregnancy, premature motherhood, and failure to plan for the future. Research indicates that most homeless young women are aware of birth control, but few of those who became pregnant were able to translate this knowledge into practice. The failure of homeless mothers to engage in family planning is strongly associated with their low levels of education; 65% did not complete high school. Sixty-five percent of homeless women do not use birth control, and 56 percent have had an abortion. Current efforts to deter teenage motherhood have consistently failed, as have efforts to reduce welfare dependency. Proposed welfare reforms, which include severe funding cuts to public assistance and other subsidies, will only destroy the remaining safety net, and will surely stimulate poverty and homelessness. Homeless women may feel that abortion is the only route open to them. Policy makers must begin to experiment with alternate initiatives to current efforts to prevent teen pregnancy. Assistance must be linked to educational opportunities, and young mothers must return to school in order to receive welfare. Broad residential-based educational initiatives will help instill traditional family values of responsibility and independence and put young families on the track to self-sufficiency and self-determination.

AB  - "Kids Count in Colorado!" is an annual publication of the Colorado Children's Campaign, which provides the best available state- and county-level data to measure and track the education, health and general well-being of the state's children. "Kids Count in Colorado!" informs policy debates and community discussions, serving as a valuable resource for policymakers, community leaders, advocates and citizens. This report, "The Impact of the Great Recession on Kids in Colorado," contains some of the earliest data of its kind in Colorado and in the nation about the implications of the recession on children's lives. In addition to reporting some of the first available data on child well-being trends affected by the Great Recession, including child health, early childhood care and development and education, this year's "KIDS COUNT in Colorado!" also includes trends in participation in the programs and services that support Colorado kids. While demand for these programs is growing because of need, participation is limited by the diminishing state resources available to meet the need, and this combination will likely have an effect on children's lives for years to come. When children are not prepared to learn, when student achievement gaps persist, when children are more obese, less healthy and unable to access basic health care, kids and their families suffer and the state's ability to compete in a global economy is diminished. The Great Recession has taken a toll on Colorado's families, their neighbors and their children. Coming on the heels of nearly a decade of significant poverty increases, many Coloradans were already especially vulnerable to its impacts. And while there are recent indications that economic factors, including employment rates, are improving, the implications on children are ongoing and significant.

AB  - A total of 1,040 publicly operated state and local juvenile detention, correction, and shelter facilities held 49,322 juvenile residents on February 1, 1985, an increase of 1% from the previous year. About 93% of the juveniles were accused of, or had been convicted for, acts which would be criminal offenses if committed by adults. Most of the rest were status offenders, such as truants, runaways, or curfew violators. The juvenile population was predominantly male (86%) and white (61%). There were 185 juveniles confined in public facilities per 100,000 juveniles at least 10 years old, up 5% from 1985. The western United States had the highest confinement rate, followed by the Midwest, South, and Northeast. About 18% of the public juvenile facilities had more residents than they were designed to hold, down from 21% in 1983. Most facilities were locally run, although most juveniles were held in state-run facilities. The average cost for housing one resident was highest in the Northeast ($39,000), followed by the Midwest ($26,100), the West ($22,900), and the South ($22,700). Juveniles detained pending adjudication, disposition, or placement stayed an average of 12 days in custody. Juveniles committed by court authorities stayed an average of 163 days; those who were voluntarily admitted stayed an average of 32 days. (Twelve tables illustrate the statistics.) (ABL)

AB  - The current study evaluated the use of various behavioral measures of running away with regard to (a) the differential utility of interval- versus event-based measures, (b) the differential utility of rate versus duration measures, (c) the utility of correcting for occurrence opportunity, and (d) the influence of unit of analysis (i.e., single-subject vs. grouped data). Seven different baseline measures were calculated for 84 runaways, and a unit-size analysis was conducted by constructing groups of various sizes from the original sample. An expert panel evaluated the suitability of the baseline measures for treatment evaluation. Results demonstrate the utility of evaluating duration-based measures and correcting for occurrence opportunity. Results also indicate that single-subject baselines may often be unacceptable for treatment evaluations, regardless of the type of measure selected for use. (Contains 5 figures.)

AB  - Examined predictors of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use with homeless adolescents and preadolescents (N=234). Results reveal that social influences (friends and family drug use) are strong predictors of experimental drug use and intentions to use drugs, as are several psychological factors (psychological well-being, assertiveness, and social support).

AB  - This digest summarizes information suggesting that long bus rides are part of the hidden costs of school and district consolidation. Rural school districts spend more than twice per pupil what urban districts spend on transportation. A review of studies shows that rural school children were more likely than suburban school children to have bus rides of 30 minutes or longer, and that their rides were more arduous, traversing poorer roads and rougher terrain. Rural elementary children were more likely to be placed on buses with middle and high school students. A rural Quebec study found that long bus rides reduced the number and variety of household activities and reduced students' sleep time, recreational time, academic attentiveness, and extracurricular participation. One might theorize that by removing rural children and their activities, rural school busing erodes the "social capital" of rural communities. A 5-state study found that almost all rural children experienced one-way bus rides of more than 30 minutes, and approximately one quarter experienced one-way rides of more than 60 minutes. Another study found that impoverished rural schools had longer rides than more affluent rural schools. Research is needed on the relationship of long rides to student achievement. Given that rural students in impoverished areas confront longer rides, longer rides are a function of larger attendance areas, and smaller size benefits poorer students, it seems unlikely that longer rides constitute an academic benefit for poor students and communities.

AB  - This Kids Count report examines trends in the well-being of Rhode Island's children, highlighting progress made in reaching the goals for children set by the Rhode Island Children's Cabinet in 1997 and discussing the remaining challenges. This statistical portrait is based on trends in 24 indicators of child well being: (1) prenatal care; (2) health insurance; (3) immunizations; (4) lead poisoning; (5) early care and education; (6) full-day kindergarten; (7) reading proficiency in fourth grade; (8) high performing schools; (9) English language learners; (10) school-age child care; (11) births to teens; (12) high school graduation; (13) homeless children; (14) children witnessing domestic violence; (15) child abuse and neglect; (16) out-of-home placement; (17) teen violent crime; (18) youth at the training school; (19) children in poverty; (20) median household income; (21) housing costs; (22) educational attainment; (23) children enrolled in the Family Independence Program; and (24) child care and health insurance supports for working families. The report's introduction presents a letter from Rhode Island Kids Count and the Children's cabinet detailing the 1997 goals and summarizing the findings; the introduction also includes demographic information on Rhode Island's children. The remainder of the report presents findings for each indicator, with trend data back to the late 1980s for some indicators, and with racial/ethnic or geographic area differences noted as available. For each indicator, the following is noted: (1) its importance for children's well-being; (2) progress made; and (3) challenges remaining. The report notes that the state is moving toward meeting its goals, but that significant disparities remain in outcomes among different racial, ethnic, and economic groups. (KB)

AB  - This report begins by discussing the role of the New York Education Department; community education agencies; school boards, administrators, teachers, and their associations; community-based organizations; and the role of other state and local agencies in creating collaborative approaches to early childhood programming. Several collaborative early childhood programs are described to make up the bulk of the report, including: the Adolescent Child Care Program (funded by the Child Care and Development Block Grant); Early Childhood Direction centers (statewide referral and information networks for parents and professionals who suspect a child under five years of age to have a disability or be at risk of developing a disability); the New York State Prekindergarten Program; Community Schools Programs; Even Start Family Literacy program; Education of Homeless Children and Youth Program; programs for students with disabilities, including the SuperStart Prekindergarten Program, the SuperStart Plus program, and Kindergarten Plus, Grade One Plus, and Grade Two Plus programs; and the Summer Primary/Promoting Success program. A list of 12 areas in early childhood programming for which multicultural strategies can be developed and a discussion of conclusions end the report. (DR)

AB  - Nearly half of students who drop out do so as a result of adverse conditions in the school, while 37% of dropouts are pulled out of school by challenges like financial worries, family needs, or employment. Only 14% of dropouts did so for reasons that can be described as failing out of school due to a lack of interest or academic progress (Doll, Eslami, & Walters, 2013). In light of this information, students experiencing homelessness are at particularly high risk for quitting school before graduation. Fortunately, the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (McKinney-Vento Act) and Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) are designed to improve those odds by providing educational opportunities and supports for students. The McKinney-Vento Act contains several provisions that can reduce dropout rates by helping students remain in school and stay on track. First, the law requires that homeless students who move be immediately enrolled at either the school of origin or the local attendance area school, based on the student's best interest (McKinney-Vento Act section 722(g)(3)(B)). A local education agency (LEA) is required to presume that keeping a homeless student in the school of origin is in his or her best interest, unless remaining in the school of origin goes against the wishes of parents, guardians, or unaccompanied youth (McKinney-Vento Act section 722(g)(3)(B)(i)). In addition to preventing students from dropping out of school, the enrollment provisions in the McKinney-Vento Act are critical for homeless students as high mobility and seat-time policies often cause students to lose valuable classroom time necessary to earn credits. LEA plans under Title I of the ESEA must be designed in coordination with other laws, including the McKinney-Vento Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Act. Requirements for LEA Title I plans provide homeless liaisons with the opportunity to engage in conversations with district leadership, Title I directors, families, unaccompanied homeless youths, and other stakeholders about the challenges faced by homeless students in all areas of education, but in relation to barriers to credit accrual in particular.

AB  - This document, the second of three volumes in the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment's "Adolescent Health" series, provides background information on aspects of adolescents' lives and examines the effectiveness of prevention and treatment interventions. Chapter 1, an introduction to this two-part document, provides a summary of the contents of this volume as well as an outline of the series as a whole. Part 1 focuses on the background of adolescent health and provides a framework for viewing the lives and social environments of adolescents. The three individual chapters in this part examine respectively: adolescent development that may affect health, the delivery of health services, and public policy with respect to adolescents; the families of adolescents and models of parent-adolescent interaction; and school environments and discretionary time. Each of the 10 chapters in part 2 examines a specific health problem: accidental injuries; chronic physical illnesses; nutrition and fitness problems; dental and oral health problems; Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome and other sexually transmitted diseases; pregnancy and parenting; mental health problems; alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse; delinquency; and homelessness. For each chapter, sections are included on: (1) limitations of existing sources of data on the health problem, the prevalence of the problem among adolescents, and differences in prevalence by selected sociodemographic and nondemographic characteristics; (2) information on the prevention and treatment of the problem; (3) relevant federal policies and programs; and (4) conclusions and policy implications. A separate index is included for Volumes I, II, and III of this "Adolescent Health" series. (NB)

AB  - This report evaluates the Seattle (Washington) Public Schools Interagency Programs, a joint state-city-school district effort to educate youth who are on parole or probation. Since its inception in 1970, the program has expanded to include homeless youth, youth who are practicing or recovering substance abusers, and other youth who are at-risk of juvenile delinquency. Each site was assessed in terms of the following program objectives: (1) regular attendance; (2) the student's ability to set goals and measure progress toward those goals; (3) improvement in mathematics and reading achievement; and (4) positive school experience. Evaluation information was drawn from observations and staff interviews at the 13 program sites, a student survey, and student records. Each program is described, including a case study of a typical client, a summary of responses to the student survey, and an assessment of program outcomes. Cross-site student concerns are summarized. Recommendations include a reexamination of behavioral, attendance, and achievement objectives, improvements in developing and reporting student objectives, and incorporation of student suggestions. A description of how preprogram attendance was determined, and analyses of student responses to two survey questions are appended. (FMW)

AB  - Homelessness is a reality for many families with young children in the United States. Homeless children and youths lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. In 2017, about a third of all people who stayed in a shelter were families with children, and nearly half of children served by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-funded emergency and transitional housing providers were age five or younger (HUD, 2018). Furthermore, children under the age of one make up less than six percent of the overall child population in the United States, yet they constitute 10 percent of the child population served by HUD-funded shelters. In January 2016, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) released "Early Childhood Homelessness 50-State Profiles" (ED609119) as part of an interagency early childhood workgroup of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH). ACF released a second state profile in 2017 (ED609123) and then the U.S. Department of Education (ED) issued reports in 2018 (ED594740), 2019 (ED600425), and 2020 (ED609095). This report presents the five-year trend for publicly available data collected from 2013-14 to 2017-18 by ED, the U.S. Census Bureau (Census), HUD (2014 to 2018), and the Annie E. Casey Foundation (2013 to 2017). Its purpose is to inform policymakers, practitioners, and researchers on the change in the size and service coverage of young children experiencing homelessness during this five-year period. This report presents five-year trends using information from the previous reports covering data collected from 2013-14 to 2017-18 to provide a snapshot of children under age six who are experiencing homelessness at the national level. The data are from the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico--limited information is also available for selected U.S. territories--and the following data are presented by state: (1) Number of children under age six by jurisdiction from 2014 to 2018 (Exhibit 1); (2) Number and percentage of children under age six experiencing homelessness by jurisdiction from 2013-14 to 2017-18 (Exhibit 2); and (3) Number and percentage of children under age six experiencing homelessness served by federally-funded education programs from 2013-14 to 2017-18 (i.e., Head Start and McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act subgrants) (Exhibit 3). This report also includes two indicators on related factors: the percentage of families experiencing a "high housing cost burden" (defined as spending 30 percent or more of monthly income on housing expenses) and the percentage of young children under age six with no parent in the labor force in the United States (Exhibit 4).

AB  - This qualitative study examines the collaboration and leadership practice that influences the education of homeless students in a large Mid-Atlantic city. The perspectives of administrators and staff members from three homeless shelters are analyzed with insights from Spillane's (Distributed leadership, 2006) distributed leadership theory. Findings from the study indicate that differences in shelter and school structures and cultures present significant obstacles to productive communication that would facilitate homeless children's schooling. Several structural and programmatic recommendations are made towards developing more effective leadership practice among schools and shelters.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether published subtypes of attachment disorder can be reliably identified by trained clinicians reviewing data from high-risk populations and to investigate the relationship between disorder classification and standardized measures of attachment behavior. Method: Twenty or more children aged 18 to 48 months and their primary caregivers were recruited from three sites: a treatment team for maltreated young children (n = 20), a homeless shelter (n = 25), and Head Start centers (n = 24). All dyads completed a semistructured clinical assessment and laboratory and home-based attachment measures. Results: All but one type of attachment disorder could be identified reliably by clinician raters ([kappa] range = 0.62-0.74, depending on subtype). Children from the maltreatment sample were significantly more likely to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups (p < .001). As predicted, children without an attachment disorder were more likely to be classified as securely attached than those with an attachment disorder (p = .03); however, children classified as having disorganized attachment were not more likely to receive an attachment disorder diagnosis. Conclusions: Attachment disorders can be reliably diagnosed in young children, though research on refining disorder criteria should precede intervention trials. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2004;43(5):568-577. Key Words: reactive attachment disorder, diagnosis, infancy, early childhood.

AB  - The federal government enacted the McKinney--Vento Homeless Assistance Act (MVA) to equip schools with services to help alleviate the many barriers students experiencing homelessness face in pursuit of educational opportunities. Educational agencies use federally mandated liaisons to uphold the provisions of the MVA. Despite the homeless liaisons' importance in facilitating the policy, few studies have examined how liaisons perceive their service area's response to homelessness. This study explored homeless liaisons' perceptions of MVA implementation in their service areas. Researchers invited every homeless liaison in three southern states to complete an online survey focusing on perceptions of MVA implementation and their service area's response to homelessness. Of the 369 practitioners identified as a homeless liaison solicited for study participation, 32 percent completed surveys. Results indicated significant differences in perceived implementation in the level of collaboration with teachers and school administrators, liaisons' job titles, school's receipt of federal Education for Homeless Children and Youth funding, and awareness of homelessness in terms of general awareness, interaction, policy, and needs. Findings indicate that collaboration and awareness are major factors that affect perceptions of implementation. Furthermore, the results indicate that liaisons must take steps to ensure a collaborative environment to implement the MVA.

AB  - Recognizing that communities can accomplish more for their children if all parts of the community work together in a collaborative effort, family-school-community-business partnerships have developed to provide comprehensive services to children and their families more effectively. This report contains information on the history, purposes, and structures of family-school-community-business partnerships and offers examples of such partnerships that are making a difference for children. Following introductory remarks, section 1 of the report discusses efforts to improve educational quality and accountability. Section 2 discusses the evolution of collaboration from the early 1900s to the present and presents the goals of family-school-community-business partnerships. Collaboration models are described, and three major types of partnership service-delivery models presented: school-based, school-linked, and community-based. Section 3 of the report describes the unique needs, key players, and primary characteristics of partnerships that target the following underserved or underrecognized areas: (1) early childhood education; (2) education of homeless children and youth; (3) education of migrant children, youth, and their families; (4) education of children of poverty; (5) preparation of teachers to work with children with learning disabilities; and (6) reduction of the achievement gap through improved educational opportunities. Section 4 describes the critical components of successful partnerships: client-access facilitators, delivery-system facilitators, and government facilitators. (Contains 128 references.)

AB  - This report is the fourth to present nationwide data on the well-being of America's children. The statistical portrait is based on indicators of child well-being such as family income and mortality rates. Part 1 of the report, "Population and Family Characteristics," presents information illustrating the changes that have occurred during the last few decades in six key demographic measures, including children as a proportion of the population, racial and ethnic composition, difficulty speaking English, and child care utilization. Part 2, "Indicators of Children's Well-Being," presents data on 25 key indicators in the following areas: (1) Economic Security, including family income, secure parental employment, housing, food security, and access to health care; (2) Health, including activity limitation, immunization rates, and infant, child, and adolescent mortality rates; (3) Behavior and Social Environment, including cigarette smoking, alcohol and illicit drug use, and youth victims and perpetrators of serious violent crimes; (4) Education, including family reading to young children and youth neither enrolled in school nor working; and (5) Special Features, beginning kindergartners' knowledge and skills and youth participation in volunteer activities. For each background measure or indicator, three types of information are presented: reasons the measure or indicator is important to understanding children's well-being, figures showing important facts about trends or population groups, and highlights with information on current status, recent trends, and important population group differences. Additional indicators needed are also noted. Two appendices contain detailed data tables and data source descriptions. Among the key findings, the report notes that although the child poverty rate remains similar to that in 1980, the percentage of children experiencing housing problems or food insecurity increased. Child death rates continue to drop. The percentage of children with low birthweight has steadily increased since 1984, probably due to the rising number of multiple births. Teen birth rates are the lowest in 40 years. Heavy drinking among adolescents has remained stable over the past few years. Violent crimes committed by youth have dropped sharply. Preschool enrollment increases have been the largest among children in poverty, children with mothers not in the labor force, and black, non-Hispanic children. The overall high school completion rate declined, especially among Hispanics. (KB)

AB  - Ongoing research and evaluation that produce actionable, widely disseminated evidence are central to the continuous improvement of U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) programs. In addition, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 (WIOA) requires DOL to conduct periodic, independent evaluations to inform the effective operation of WIOA programs and services. To support the development of DOL's research portfolio, this scan examines existing evidence on key topics related to WIOA programs and services. The scan focuses on four main topic areas, selected through a series of discussions with DOL's Chief Evaluation Office, Employment and Training Administration (ETA), and other DOL staff: (1) case management; (2) integrated service delivery; (3) training programs; and (4) youth services. Although the first three sections on service strategies focus on evidence from studies on adults or general populations, these services also relate to programs serving youth. However, because of the policy importance of identifying effective strategies for disconnected youth ages 16 to 24, the final section is devoted to research on youth, focusing on the many strategies offered by the WIOA Youth program. The scan describes strategies associated with each of the four topic areas, discusses existing evidence on the effectiveness of those strategies and evaluations currently under way, and summarizes the knowledge gaps in the existing evidence base. The scan prioritizes studies of strategies used in WIOA and by partner programs, but it also incorporates studies on related programs to increase the pool of studies from which to draw evidence. This research evidence scan is one of a pair of reports developed as part of DOL's WIOA Research Portfolio project.

AB  - This paper describes the culture of experiential community based learning at Central College, a rural liberal arts college in Midwestern, USA. Pre-service teachers use experiential community based learning to reflect on their personal growth in understanding the needs of diverse learners. Reflections demonstrate how the program contributes to the development of cultural awareness. There is a culture of civic engagement as stated in the college strategic plan and community goals. The program is coordinated through the Center for Community Based Learning (CCBL) which acts as a liaison with not-for-profit organizations in Des Moines and other at risk locations in Iowa. Students are placed with not-for-profit organizations to give support to low income families, refugees, the homeless, immigrants; teaching English, or working with at risk children and young adults in alternative high schools and shelters. The paper presents research findings regarding the impact on college students of experiential learning. The pre-service teachers describe the challenges and learning outcomes from their out of class experiences. The study participants, in the human relations education course have to commit to fifteen hours of experiential community service. The program develops dispositions and skills for pre-service teachers to understand multicultural education in preparation for teaching in increasingly diverse classrooms. The paper presents data collated from the students' reflections, journals, research papers and in class discussions. The pre-service teachers describe the impact of working with multicultural groups to include: increased cultural awareness, a greater understanding of learner differences, and the development of empathy for the needs of diverse communities.

AB  - Arguing that adolescence is a syndrome to be managed rather than a stage to be outgrown, this book offers suggestions from a high school principal as an insider's guide to today's teenage world. The book contends that the major task of adolescence is to gain mastery over emotion, and that a partnership between parents and educators is imperative if the modern American teenager is to survive. The intention of the book is not only to help parents cope with their teens, but to also shed light on what parents can learn about themselves in the process. The book presents timely issues with helpful tips for parenting teens. The chapters of the book are: (1) "Adolescence Is a Syndrome," explaining that adolescence is an unavoidable though temporary departure from normalcy; (2) "Let's Get Cranky," examining how adolescence is full of contradictions; (3) "Let's Get Hysterical," dealing with authoritative vs. authoritarian or permissive parenting styles; (4) "Let's Get Physical," providing tips for discussing sexuality, sexual abuse, rape and AIDS; (5) "Let's Get Moral," examining temporary moral insanity and issues of moral education; (6) "Lying, Cheating, and Stealing," explaining the reactions of authoritative parents to these behaviors; (7) "Crossing the Line," addressing drugs, runaways, suicide, depression and eating disorders; (8) "Young Women," dealing with feminine identity; (9) "Difference in the 1990s," urging education for and acceptance of diversity; (10) "Let's Get Educated," calling for education reform that fosters a relationship between teachers and students; and (11) "Let's Get Motivated," discussing factors which foster or block motivation. The conclusion of the book portrays the isolation that many teens feel and emphasizes the importance of contact with caring adults. Contains an annotated list of 42 suggested readings and a bibliography of 190 references. (AMC)

AB  - England's Learning and Skills Development Agency welcomes the introduction of a coherent national funding and delivery strategy for adult literacy, numeracy, and English for speakers of other languages (ESOL). The agency believes that the strategy should incorporate the lessons of previous literacy and numeracy initiatives and build on examples of good practice across the post-16 sector, including work-based, community-based, and further education college-based provision. It is also the agency's hope that literacy and numeracy students be approached as adult customers and that funding streams for basic skills be harmonized. The agency has 96 specific recommendations concerning the following areas: (1) challenges facing literacy, numeracy, and ESOL education; (2) motivation and participation; (3) infrastructure for delivery; (4) new targets and resources; (5) priority groups; (6) building a firm foundation (management, teaching staff, initial assessment, accommodation); (6) management of learning (learning programs, certification for bite-sized achievement, progression); (7) national tests; (8) national curriculum; (9) key skills and basic skills; (10) new teaching materials; (11) inspection; (11) pathfinder projects; (12) flexible learning and information and communications technology; and (13) next steps. (Specific agency recommendations regarding staff training, priority groups, and non-schedule 2 evaluations are appended. Twenty-five endnotes are included.) (MN)

AB  - The "Supportive Housing for Homeless Families: Foster Care Outcomes and Best Practices" report describes the outcome evaluation of Cottage Housing Incorporated's Serna Village program in Sacramento, California. Serna Village is a supportive housing program serving homeless families. Outcomes from the program illustrate that it is possible to end recidivism into the child welfare system for homeless families by providing them with permanent housing and comprehensive support services. Although homeless and marginally housed families have high rates of involvement in the child welfare system, this study found that permanent and stable housing, social support and case management services can prevent these disenfranchised families from re-entering the foster care system. The intervention of supportive housing--housing and services focused on the unique needs of adults and their children exiting homelessness--may break the cycle of abuse and neglect among these families. Conducted in 2011, this study involved a sample of 293 children and youth from approximately 150 families who lived with one or more parents in Cottage Housing Incorporated's Serna Village between 2002 and 2009, the first seven years of the program. The findings from this study indicate that comprehensive supportive housing programs following a best-practice model can provide homeless parents and their children with stable living for a significant period of time. Supportive housing programs also may give homeless parents an opportunity to find and maintain employment, work on their education, save a substantial amount of money for move-out costs, learn daily living skills, experience a real-world living situation and prevent re-entry into the child welfare system. The outcomes from this study may help inform policymakers and child welfare administrators with recommendations to better assist marginalized families and save valuable funding dollars.

AB  - This volume presents information from a social indicators project designed to shed light on factors affecting civic health in twenty-six communities where John S. and James L. Knight published newspapers and provided grants to improve quality of life. Seven chapters discuss research results: (1) "Listening and Learning" (e.g., growth of community indicators, putting indicators to use, and sharing with communities); (2) "Demographic, Economic and Social Context of Knight Communities"; (3) "Civic Engagement (e.g., volunteering, charitable giving, and attitudes about race/ethnicity); (4) "Education" (e.g., charter schools, perceptions of illiteracy, and influences on perceptions of local public schools and illiteracy); (5) "Well-Being of Children and Families" (e.g., perceptions of unsupervised youth, perceptions of child care, and involvement with youth development organizations); (6) "Housing and Community Development" (e.g., perceptions of safety, perceptions of homelessness, and perceptions of employment); and (7) "Vitality of Cultural Life" (e.g., perceptions of arts and culture, performance ratings of local public libraries, and attendance of nonprofit arts and cultural activities). Each chapter includes an overview, current community conditions, and survey findings. Three appendices present survey methodology, a bibliography, and data sources. (SM)

AB  - This study used an ecological perspective to examine the development and implementation of Hopeful Horizons, a program designed to serve the educational needs of homeless children in Morgan County, Oklahoma. Information was collected through journals, observations, key informant interviews, surveys of administrators and staff, and psychological assessments of the children. Program components were education, social services and health, counseling, parent, and volunteer. Analyses indicated that: it was difficult to find time to develop individualized educational programs; volunteers were often not available; an additional counselor and social work assistant were needed to fulfill the social component; receiving schools were oppositional to receiving homeless students; the speech language pathologist position was eliminated because of difficulties in delivering services; and the counselor position was not filled for 2 years. In addition, parental difficulties limited parents' participation. Without personnel to recruit and train volunteers, only 5 volunteers were involved in the first 2 years of the program. About 400 children were served by the program. Points of contention among staff included the shifting program, whether to include emancipated youth, agency commitment, and responsibility. Assessment results yielded a profile of a homeless child concerned about family relationships, but also experiencing one or more of the following: normal motivation; a visual-motor delay suggesting difficulty with school-related tasks; poor planning ability, organization skills, motor coordination, and emotional stability; and a positive academic self-concept, fairly high anxiety level, and depressive tendencies. From 1990-91 to 1994-95, the program grew in number of personnel, volunteers, children served, and budget and location size. (Contains approximately 70 references.) (Author/KB)

AB  - The effectiveness of five tracking strategies (collateral contacts, Internet databases, driver's records, letters, and community visits) used in attempting to locate homeless and housed adolescents 4.5 years after they were first contacted was examined and compared. The study sample comprised 401 adolescents (252 homeless and 149 matched housed) from 8 counties in Southeast Michigan. Homelessness was defined as sleeping in a shelter, at a friend's home without parental permission, or on the streets for at least 1 night within 1 month before initial contact. We successfully located and interviewed 85% (n = 340) of our sample at the 4.5-year time point. The most effective tracking procedure was collateral contact, which was important in locating 43% of participants in this study, followed by Internet databases (18%), community visits (11%), driver's records (6%), and letters (6%).

AB  - The objectives of this study were: (1) To determine factors which inhibit and facilitate child and adolescent use of outdoor spaces for healthy physical activity by race and ethnicity in four Houston communities; and (2) To propose guidelines for encouraging and maintaining child and adolescent outdoor physical activity. Using local health data and Houston Police Department crime statistics, four communities were identified for the study that had the highest concentration of crime and the racial/ethnic groups of interest. The researchers then identified public parks in the communities. At least two parks were observed in each of the four communities from 2010 to 2011 during spring, summer, fall and winter. The parks were observed for use by children and adolescents and to describe the condition of the park spaces. The communities were Alief (Asian), Sunnyside (Black), Eldridge- West Oaks (White) and Northside- Northline (Hispanic). Observations were made at varying hours of both day and night, weekdays and weekends. Photographs were taken and the condition of the spaces noted in detail. One hundred and twenty persons, 18 years and over, using the spaces or otherwise in these communities were conveniently sampled and interviewed about their health and the extent to which they, or any children or adolescents under their care, used the outdoor spaces of interest. Data were analyzed qualitatively and with basic descriptive statistics. The photographs, journal notes and observation notes of all investigators and key personnel were analyzed. Interview data were also coded to identify patterns and themes in the responses. The findings indicate disparities in the quality and quantity of park equipment and the maintenance of the areas. Where perceptions of disorder were described, there was often visible evidence to support the perceptions. In many cases, residents' perceptions of crime were corroborated by police data. While interview reports did not seem to support the expectation that the condition of the parks was a significant deterrent to their use by children and adolescents, the condition of the parks might be said to limit the extent of that use. Specific reports of disorder that inhibited use included hearing gunfire, seeing drug dependent homeless persons and/or suspected prostitutes in an area.

AB  - Covenant House Texas (CHT) is a nonprofit corporation that provides emergency shelter and related services for children and youth in crisis situations. The Texas Education Agency requires an annual evaluation of all programs receiving state compensatory education funds, and the On-Site School program of CHT was evaluated under this provision. The On-Site school program allows students who cannot attend their home schools to continue their schooling while at the CHT center. The On-Site school served a total of 53 students in the 1996-97 school year. Overall, students had positive perceptions of the program. Although enrollment dropped since the program no longer served youth in custody, the percentage of students staying longer in the program and the numbers of juniors and seniors rose. The classroom was filled to capacity, and students and the teacher noted the need for additional space. Among the difficulties experienced by the program was a lack of communication with the student's home school, causing problems in student transfers in and out of the program. An appendix contains the student survey. (Contains four tables.) (SLD)

AB  - Recent data have shown that children of immigrant noncitizens experience more persistent and higher levels of food insecurity than the children of citizens following welfare reform. However, little is known about the range of factors that might explain different rates of food insecurity in the different populations. In this study, the authors used national data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten cohort to assess this question, using multivariate probit regression analyses in a low-income sample. They found that households of children (foreign and U.S.-born) with noncitizen mothers are at substantially greater risk of food insecurity than their counterparts with citizen mothers and that demographic characteristics such as being Latina, levels of maternal education, and large household size explain about half of the difference in rates.

AB  - This research was aimed to develop multimedia and activities to enhance knowledge about arts and cultures for community youths through social lab at the community under the bridge zone 1, to determine the quality of the multimedia and activities, to examine the learning achievement of the community youths, to evaluate the satisfaction of the sampling group and to evaluate the after-action review (AAR) of the organizers. The research tools in this study included the quality evaluation form for contents, the quality evaluation form for media and activities, the learning achievement test, the satisfaction survey for the sampling group towards the multimedia and activities, and the activity to get after-action review (AAR) of the organizers. The sampling group consisted of people who had lived in the community under the bridge zone 1 for over 2 years had participated in this research from the beginning till the end. There were 120 people who filled out the questionnaires. They were chosen using purposive sampling method. The group included local people and community youths. The research results showed that the organizers ran the project about dancing performance alongside single-head drums for the community youths through social lab. The multimedia included vinyl media and video clips to teach dancing performance alongside music from single-head drums. The clips and teaching were made by students who got scholarship from KMUTT for their art and cultural skills and the fence-painting activity was done by graduate students from the LTM652 Principle and Theories of Mass Communication course. The organizers analyzed, designed and developed multimedia and activities in accordance with the ADDIE Model in the first semester of the academic year 2018. The quality of the contents was at a good level (x-bar = 4.46, S.D = 0.26). The quality of the media and activities was at a very good level (x-bar = 4.60, S.D = 0.26). The learning achievement of the students from their pre-test and post-test scores showed that their average post-test score was higher with statistical significance at the 0.05 level. The satisfaction of the sampling group was at the highest level (x-bar = 4.63, S.D = 0.56), confirming the research hypothesis. The after-action review showed that it was at a good level. The organizers expressed their opinion that the multimedia and activities to enhance knowledge about arts and cultures for community youths through social lab were beneficial for both the organizers and the community youths. The organizers learned how to work as a team and they could use their skills in real situations. They realized the importance of giving, especially teaching knowledge about arts and cultures for community youths. The community youths learned to spend their free time on useful activities and did not involve in drug abuse. They also learned new skills and they could do dancing performance to earn their living on the weekends and holidays or when there were festive events. It could be concluded that the multimedia and activities to enhance knowledge about arts and cultures for community youths through social lab were of good quality and could be applied for real use.

AB  - Although federal funds comprise less than 7 percent of all educational spending in Ohio, the programs they fuel benefit thousands of children each year. This report summarizes data for fiscal year 1997 on federal programs authorized through Titles I, II, IV, VI, and VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and through the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. Most of the report is concerned with Title I programs, operated in 592 of Ohio's 611 school districts. In fiscal 1997, Title I programs served 296,202 students who lived in low-income families, institutions for neglected or delinquent children, or foster homes, as well as 2,953 migrant students in preschool and grades K-12. Details are provided on federal funding, institutional participation, student participation by institutional type and grade span, instructional services, student performance on state proficiency tests, expenditure patterns, teachers and staff, professional development, parent involvement, and successes. Profiles describe: (1) Title II, the Eisenhower Professional Development Program, which funded training for over 38,000 educators; (2) Title IV, Safe Drug-Free Schools, which funded prevention and intervention programs; (3) Title VI, Innovative Assistance Program, which encourages comprehensive education reform; (4) Title VII, Lau Resource Center, which funded services for immigrant students and those with limited English proficiency; and (5) education for homeless children and youth.

AB  - All Individuals Deserve Support (AIDS) is a collaborative prevention program between graduate students in a Community/Agency Counseling program and the Children's Home Homeless Youth Program in Peoria, Illinois. Graduate students developed a comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention program for homeless youth as a class project. Project design involved: assessing the needs of the target population; developing prevention activities; implementing the program; and evaluating the program. Students worked in cooperative groups throughout the program. They collected information of such programs via the Internet and more traditional sources. Guest speakers addressed the class on the topic of interest. Students developed interview questions and interviewed the case managers who worked most closely with the homeless youth. The interviews indicated that case managers were very concerned about their clients' unprotected sexual activity and attitudes toward casual sex. Case managers noted that the most effective types of programs were highly interactive and had meaning for daily living challenges. Students implemented the program with clients from the Homeless Youth Program. To support the case managers, students developed a resource library, conducted inservice training for direct service providers, and offered a psychoeducational group for clients on self-esteem and assertiveness. Each aspect of the program was evaluated via activity logs, portfolios, and participant feedback. Both case managers and clients considered the program very good and very helpful. (SM)

AB  - Rural people in their environment have the necessary attributes to successfully endure and survive those trials that would lead to urban decline. As societal problems require increased investment in existing institutions, the growing complexity eventually yields a lower level of benefits or returns. Urban problems such as hunger, homelessness, and crowding mirror events taking place in Third World countries. City dwellers command a disproportionate share of society's financial and natural resources and generate a disproportionate share of its wastes. Historically, rural America has benefitted from the continuity of home, school, and community as opposed to the fragmentation of urban life. Rural replication of fragmented urban institutions such as schools and welfare agencies may become counterproductive to the rural community. Economic development efforts in rural areas should involve young people and promote increased involvement and pride in the community. Increased economic opportunity should provide substantial reasons and means for youth to remain in rural areas as productive adults. Rural development efforts should involve: (1) carefully examining urban problems; (2) exploring, defining, and emphasizing the positive qualities of rural places; and (3) exploring school and community options that take advantage of developing scarcities and new technologies to provide decentralized services.

AB  - The Stewart B. McKinney Act of 1987 was intended to remove barriers and ensure access to education for homeless children. But despite a 1988 consent decree, the United States Department of Education (DOE) has failed to comply with its statutory duties to implement the Act, the states have also failed to implement the Act adequately, and homeless children are still being shut out of school. An extensive investigation included interviews with Federal and state officials and a 20-state survey of service providers. The following recommendations are suggested: (1) DOE should immediately comply with its obligations to distribute funds, monitor state compliance, provide technical assistance, remove limits on direct services, and report to Congress; (2) the states should take immediate, affirmative steps to comply with the McKinney Act by removing all residency requirements, expediting the transfer of records, removing burdensome documentation requirements, and providing transportation to school; and (3) the McKinney Act should be expanded to provide additional services to children who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The following material is appended: (1) pilot projects currently funded under the Act; (2) state coordinators' appraisals of the non-regulatory guidance; (3) state plan activity; (4) evaluation of initial state plans; (5) excerpts from interviews with state coordinators regarding their understanding of program dates; (6) state coordinators' assessment of communication with DOE; (7) letter from the National Association of State Coordinators for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth (NASCEHCY) to DOE and DOE response; (8) state coordinators' suggestions to DOE; and (9) a summary of interviews with shelter providers.

AB  - Homeless youth in the United States is rapidly increasing with more children living in unstable or temporary environments. They may encounter difficulties meeting enrollment requirements, have poor attendance, low academic performance, and experience behavioral and emotional issues. The reauthorization of McKinney-Vento Act (MCKV) in 2002 was created to overcome these obstacles. However, many school districts are not implementing these regulations and very little research exists on the effectiveness of MCKV, which this paper will explore.

AB  - A census of homeless youth was conducted in locations across Los Angeles County, California. Building on previous research that has focused on homeless youth in cruise areas, the authors examined demographic and behavioral differences between homeless youth in cruise and noncruise areas. Youth in cruise areas were more likely than youth in noncruise areas to be older, to have been away from home longer, to have recently visited community-based agencies, and were likely to have resided in shelters and less likely to attend school. These data suggest possible selection bias in earlier studies that relied primarily on homeless youth from cruise areas.

AB  - Youth referred to mentoring programs vary considerably in the range and severity of difficulties (i.e., behavioral, internalizing, social and academic) and environmental challenges they face. However, their patterns of risk and corresponding consequences for mentoring have rarely been investigated. This study draws on data for youth participants in 30 mentoring programs (n = 2,165, 55.1% females) to examine patterns of presenting challenges. Four profiles emerged using three-step latent profile analyses. Profiles with more intensive symptoms were associated with more environmental stressors. Moreover, there were significant differences between profiles in youth-perceived relationship attributes, including closeness, youth-centeredness, growth focus and mentor-mentee relational health. The profile with the highest externalizing and social challenge indicators scored the lowest across these four relational indices. The results highlight variability of youth risk at baseline, and its differential impact on mentoring relationship outcomes. Implications for mentoring programs are discussed.

AB  - This year's "America's Children in Brief: Key National Indicators of Well-Being" continues more than a decade of dedication and collaboration by agencies across the Federal Government to advance our understanding of our Nation's children and what may be needed to bring them a better tomorrow. "America's Children in Brief, 2018" uses both established and previously untapped data sources to characterize vulnerable children across several of the domains included in the Forum's conceptual framework. The measures included provide emerging insight on children who face special and heightened risks to their well-being. Each section of the report addresses why the measure of at-risk children is important and presents information on characteristics of the population of at-risk children. In addition to providing descriptive information on trends on the size of the population ages 0 to 17, this year's report features the following measures: (1) Poverty and extreme poverty; (2) Health insurance continuity; (3) Homelessness; (4) Exposure to violence; (5) Prescription opioid misuse and use disorders; and (6) Residential placement of juveniles.

AB  - The Career Education Center (CEC) is an alternative high school educational program than began in 1989 to serve the needs of adolescents in New York City who are homeless, educationally disadvantaged, do not fit into a traditional high school setting, or who are awaiting foster care placement. The CEC supports these students, bolsters their self-esteem, and sets up alternative learning centers at host agencies to accommodate students. As of September 1993, CEC was serving approximately 1,300 students at 33 sites. Interviews at seven CEC sites with program staff and agency directors were the basis for the 1993-94 evaluation. Students at each site were also interviewed. Overall, the CEC program is found to be highly successful in serving the varied needs of these high-risk students. Classes are small in the CEC program, and teachers are able to assess students' strengths and weaknesses better and more quickly. Student programs are a major strength of the program, as is the smooth working collaboration among personnel. Improvements in student attendance, self-esteem, and academic achievement have been noted. One table and six figures present evaluation findings. (SLD)

AB  - Background: Exposure to multiple stressors and lack of access to resources place rural children at high risk for adverse consequences. Family Stress Model guided this study to examine relations between two stressors--food insecurity and maternal depressive symptoms, and behavior problems among younger and older rural children. Objective: To test associations between food insecurity, maternal depressive symptoms, and behavior problems among younger and older rural low-income children. Methods: Cross-sectional data from 370 low-income rural families across 13 states was analyzed using structural equation modeling and multiple group analyses. Mothers' education level, household income, marital/partner status, and participation in SNAP served as covariates. Results: Among younger children, maternal depressive symptoms partially mediated the relation between food insecurity and child externalizing behaviors, while among older children, maternal depressive symptoms completely mediated the relation between food insecurity and child internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Conclusions: Stress manifested directly from, or indirectly through, maternal depressive symptoms and from food insecurity was related to behavior problems among younger and older rural children; however, the relations varied by age of children. Programs and policies that prevent or lessen both food insecurity and maternal depression may help to lessen problem behaviors among on rural children. Longitudinal studies are needed to rigorously examine causation and directionality among food insecurity, maternal depression and rural child behavior problems, while accounting for influences of child, caregiver and family characteristics.

AB  - Children in communities across Colorado--whether large or small, rural or urban, on the Eastern Plains or the Western Slope--face opportunities and obstacles to reaching their full potential. While some challenges are similar, many are very different depending on the community environment and the resources available to support children and families. Although poverty, for example, is harmful for children no matter where they live, it often presents different challenges for families in rural communities than for those in urban areas. In an effort to better understand how these opportunities and obstacles affect kids around the state, the 2015 KIDS COUNT examines differences in child well-being by community type. By examining the data through this lens will provide insight into the nuances of child well-being that exist across the state in order to make sure children have access to what they need to learn and grow, no matter where they live. There are many methods for classifying communities as urban or rural. Each method has its own benefits and drawbacks. Finding a system that works for Colorado was especially difficult; many of the methods of classifying counties as urban or rural do not take into account the complications posed by the state's diverse terrain and mountain landscapes that separate some communities from urban areas. Many methods classify counties within close proximity to Denver, such as Gilpin or Park counties, as urban, despite the fact that these areas are sparsely populated and are separated from the Denver area by mountains. Ultimately, a method was chosen that classifies counties based on factors other than proximity to an urban area: population density, the percent of the county's population that lives in a rural area, and whether the county is home to an urban area of at least 10,000 people. Using this system, known as the Isserman method, the report divided Colorado's 64 counties into four categories: urban, mixed urban, mixed rural and rural.

AB  - Over the past decade, the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services (hereinafter referred to as "the Committee") has examined a number of rural issues that touch upon the social determinants of health. The Committee's past work has focused on understanding how conditions and outcomes such as homelessness, childhood poverty, intimate partner violence, opioid misuse and suicide can be mitigated or more effectively addressed through health and human service programs under the purview of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In this policy brief, the Committee takes up adverse childhood experiences or ACEs, another layer and set of conditions that may exacerbate rural health disparities and outcomes. ACEs refer to any form of chronic stress or trauma (e.g., abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction) that, when experienced during childhood and adolescence, can have both short- and long-term impacts on an individual's development, health and overall well-being. The brief emphasizes the importance of prevention, education, and awareness at the local, state, and federal levels of health and human service delivery. Additionally, it provides a set of actionable recommendations that advise the Secretary and HHS on how to better address ACEs and their outcomes in an effort to develop comprehensive, integrated, federal partnerships.

AB  - This document examines the incidence of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) among adolescents in the United States and identifies several risk factors for AIDS among this population. It classifies adolescents' risk for contracting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by the degree to which adolescents engage in behaviors that are the primary modes of transmission for the AIDS virus. Adolescents who are not sexually active, not using intravenous drugs, and not receiving contaminated blood products are identified as having the lowest risk for HIV infection. Adolescents considered to be in the highest risk groups are homosexuals, intravenous drug users, homeless and runaway adolescents, minority youth, and youth living in inner cities. Each of these high-risk populations is discussed separately. The risk involved with condom use, alcohol use, and non-monogamous sexual relations are all considered. Other sexually transmitted diseases are discussed as providing a parallel to AIDS transmission and data on these diseases are used to project changes in adolescents' risk status for AIDS in the coming decade. Three tables of adolescent AIDS cases, the racial-ethnic distribution of AIDS cases among adolescents, and the racial-ethnic differences in transmission routes are included. Thirty-four references are cited. (NB)

AB  - Each year, over 1.2 million children and youth identified as homeless in the nation's schools experience educational disruption that is caused by not having a safe and stable place to live (NCHE, 2014). Homeless children and youth face educational challenges that include a lack of basic necessities, such as food, clothing, and medical services; discontinuity of education due to mobility; and trauma caused by the chaos, poverty, and instability of their family's circumstances, or in the case of unaccompanied homeless youth, their own circumstances. Many homeless children and youth have disabilities that create additional challenges for educational progress. The National Center on Family Homelessness reported that children who are homeless, as compared to other children, have three times the rate of emotional and behavioral problems, are four times more likely to show delayed development, and have twice the rate of learning disabilities (NCFH, 2008). Educational barriers homeless children and youth with disabilities face include: (1) not being identified as needing special education services; (2) difficulty with diagnosis due to mobility and other stressors; (3) lack of timely assessment, diagnosis, or service provision; (4) lack of continuity of services due to school transfers; (5) lack of timely or efficient records transfer when enrolling in a new school; and (6) lack of an available parent or surrogate to represent the child or unaccompanied youth. Two federal laws increase the educational stability and support needed to help homeless children and youth with disabilities succeed in school: "Subtitle VII-B of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act" [42 U.S.C. §§ 11431-11435], reauthorized in 2001 by Title X, Part C of the No Child Left Behind Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004 [20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1444] (IDEA). This brief reviews the requirements of the McKinney-Vento Act and IDEA so that educators and administrators in education for homeless children and youth (EHCY) programs and special education programs can increase their familiarity with both laws in order to coordinate efforts to improve the educational access and success of homeless children and youth with disabilities. In addition, the brief summarizes specific amendments and implementing regulations in IDEA that address the needs of homeless and highly mobile children and youth with disabilities.

AB  - This TIP on the best practice guidelines for treatment of substance abuse aims to help teach treatment providers about the latest information available to design and deliver better services to adolescent clients with substance use disorders. This publication represents advances in the understanding of the immediate and long-term physiologic, behavioral, and social consequences of use, abuse, and dependency. Adolescent substance users differ from adults in many ways, and this TIP explains how knowledge about these differences will help treatment providers grasp why adolescents use substances and how substance use may become an integral part of their identity. A discussion on program design, policies and procedures, and evaluation, as part of program development for treatment, is provided. Other treatment approaches such as therapeutic communities and 12-Step-Based Programs are detailed. It includes a discussion on contemporary family therapy as another effective form of treatment. Youth with distinctive treatment needs are considered in detail, including those in the juvenile justice system; homeless youth; those with nonheterosexual identity; and those with coexisting physical, behavioral, and psychiatric disorders. It concludes with a discussion of the legal and ethical issues of providing treatment to adolescents. The following appendixes are included: "Bibliography,""Medical Management of Drug Intoxication and Withdrawal," and "Field Reviewers." (Contains 11 figures and 173 references.) (JDM)

AB  - Although the concept of "community" has been defined in many ways, it generally encompasses subgroups that provide emotional and common-interest ties as well as a sense of subjective wholeness. This paper provides a brief chronology on community within American life and the influence of ideals arising from this history. A look at ethnographic portrayals of different contemporary communities and their ways of socializing members includes a Puerto Rican area of Manhattan (New York), a Japanese area in California, a community of black Americans in the southern United States, and two communities created by programs for adolescents and homeless youth. Ethnographers learn about groups by becoming participants and observers in those groups. All of these portrayals also include subtexts of members' collective views of learning through formal and informal education. Implications of current community life, where the community is not necessarily spatially defined, for the future of research, policy, and practice in multicultural education are discussed.

AB  - In San Francisco, where both housing costs and income inequality continue to grow, the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) is increasingly focused on supporting homeless children and families. To inform this work, SFUSD partnered with Stanford University's Graduate School of Education (GSE) and John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities (Gardner Center) to conduct research aimed at helping SFUSD better track, understand, and support their homeless and highly mobile (HHM) student population. The researchers aimed to further advance understanding of the student assets that promote resilient adaptation and educational success of HHM students. Specifically, they examined how HHM students' social and emotional learning (SEL) skills--including self-management, growth mindset, self-efficacy, and social awareness--may support their academic achievement by addressing the following research questions: 1) What is the size and distribution of HHM students in SFUSD across different grades, schools, racial ethnicities, and language backgrounds? 2) How heterogeneous is this student population in terms of chronicity of HHM status, instability of living arrangement, placement in foster care, and number of siblings? 3) What promotes resilience and positive outcomes for HHM students? [This research was conducted with support from the Stanford/SFUSD Incentive Fund.]

AB  - Suicide prevention techniques, from a clinical perspective, need to be as diversified as the population they serve. In certain special population groups, suicide has reached epidemic proportions, and there is a significant public health need for specific suicide prevention strategies. Special populations need to be identified and their suicide risk evaluated. Women, adolescents, the elderly, ethnic minorities, the emotionally disturbed, professionals, runaways, and other subgroups need biologically and environmentally specialized suicide prevention services. Historically four basic strategies have been applied to the evaluation process of suicide risk and in suicide prevention program design: (1) matching the social demographics of completed suicides; (2) psychometric assessments; (3) psychological profiles; and (4) designation of specific high risk groups. Parents, teachers, and professionals in all fields can learn to recognize the symptoms of depression or the warning signs of suicidal ideation. They can learn to recognize when someone troubled needs professional treatment and how to help network professional care. The community need for interdisciplinary suicide intervention strategies is imperative. Planning and implementation of suicide intervention and prevention programs should begin within designated special population groups identified through research. (NB)

AB  - The purpose of the McKinney-Vento Act is to ensure that students experiencing homelessness have access to the education and other services they need in order to meet state academic achievement standards, and ultimately, to graduate prepared for college and career. Most homeless educators work one-on-one with homeless children, youth, their parents and guardians. Undoubtedly, their care in supporting students to enroll, attend and succeed in school is critical to the success of homeless students and the Education for Homeless Children and Youth (EHCY) program. However, most state and local educational agencies lack the capacity required to provide intensive case management to all homeless students. The demands and stresses of serving homeless students often put stakeholders in the position of constantly reacting to overwhelming, immediate needs. To turn the tide of overwhelming student needs and program responsibilities to a more proactive course of action, State Coordinators and their partners need to determine where local educational agencies (LEAs) and homeless education programs underperform, under identify, or under serve children and youth experiencing homelessness. In order to help states identify areas for improvement, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) commissioned the creation of a set of LEA workbooks and this manual to support the use of data by State Coordinators and other key stakeholders in the education of homeless students. Primarily, this manual will assist states in creating or adjusting measurable goals and related targets, as well as evaluating the overall effectiveness of activities conducted on the part of both school districts and the state homeless education program. These goals and measures can then be used to inform the development of state plans and annual workplans for state activities.

AB  - A large body of research has established that high-quality early care and education (ECE) has benefits for young children's cognitive and social-emotional development that can lead to improved outcomes later in life, especially for children who are economically disadvantaged. Research also shows that disadvantaged children have unequal access to high-quality ECE programs in the United States, compared to their peers in higher-income families. To address these disparities, there has been a growing effort to develop policies that increase access to ECE. To assess the effectiveness of these policies, decision makers need accurate and comprehensive data on which children have access to services, the quality of these services, and how such factors are changing over time. This research report examines how states and territories are addressing, or plan to address, new requirements and goals of the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) reauthorization law related to access to early care and education (ECE) services described in their 2016-2018 FY state/territory CCDF plans. We summarize state and territory policies related to increasing access to ECE for specific populations defined by the state, determining payment rates for care, and building the supply of high-quality care. We highlight innovative state/territorial policies and practices, and provide recommendations for how states might further address access through more comprehensive data collection and analysis to inform future child care development plans. Following this introduction, we present key findings across states and territories, then present more detail on each dimension of access measured. We conclude with recommendations to help states strengthen their use of data to assess access for vulnerable populations and their efforts to increase the supply of high-quality care as they look ahead to their 2019-2021 FY CCDF plans.

AB  - As cities across the country and globe continue to generate new solutions to a wide variety of vexing problems, sharing information about what works and what doesn't has become more important than ever. Yet, outside of a few prominent policies, the vast majority of successful municipal experiments never reach a national audience or, for that matter, policymakers in similarly situated cities. To help bridge this gap, the Center for an Urban Future and NYU Wagner published "Innovation and the City" earlier this summer. Drawing upon hundreds of interviews with mayors, agency chiefs, policy institutes, corporations, labor unions and philanthropic foundations, some of the boldest and most inventive urban policy reforms of the last decade were identified. But, in that report, which was generously funded by Citi Community Development, the policies also had to address important needs in New York City. They also had to be policies that could be realistically implemented in New York, given the City's government structure and political climate. As New York prepares for a new mayor for the first time in 12 years, the thinking was that creating an inventory of the best ideas from other places would be a good way to not only spotlight theoretical solutions but workable programs that others have already started to implement and learn from. During the research process, it was discovered that a lot of promising innovations did not match up well with New York's needs, or addressed problems that the City was already confronting in a different way. So, in this second edition of the report, the criteria has been loosened to include policies that might not work in New York but are important enough to merit replication in other cities.Therefore, this report profiles 25 of the best policy innovations from cities across the U.S. and around the globe-- giving mayors and other municipal leaders the ability to learn from their peers and develop new policies based on models that have already proved effective.

AB  - The Utah State Office of Education has conducted surveys of homeless shelters throughout Utah for the past 4 years. Data show that, during 1993, 32 shelter providers reported sheltering 4,680 homeless children. Each year, however, the shelter providers report turning away an increasing number of families because of a lack of space. Budget constraints make it difficult for shelters to collect data on the number of families turned away. Shelter waiting lists of 20 families are not uncommon. The number of homeless students reported by Utah school districts may reflect a more accurate figure of the real extent of homelessness among children and youth as defined by the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. In 1993, Utah's 40 local school districts reported serving 9,969 homeless students who met the Stewart B. McKinney definition of homelessness lacking a "fixed, regular, and adequate residence." Shelter providers and district homeless student representatives both report progress in getting students registered for school and in ensuring their attendance and success. Significantly, of the 32 shelter providers surveyed, only three reported problems in registering homeless students. The districts and the shelter personnel involved in these problems are working to address the issues and provide for the needs of these students. Appendices provide survey data and survey forms as well as a list of Utah legislative appropriations, district counts, and funding. (Author/GLR)

AB  - Social, emotional, and affective experiences are impossible to separate from thinking, doing, and being in the world. Increasingly, schools and community-based organizations are recognizing this truth through the adoption of programs that focus on the emotional lives of children and youth, especially when emotions are fraught, and lives have been difficult. Programs such as social emotional learning (SEL) frameworks and trauma-informed practices (TIP) are not only popular, they are deemed "essential" in almost every corner of the social services sector. The authors in this issue suggest that these programs often focus on those who are marginalized through race, class, and/or experiences of violence, including family violence, while ignoring the social conditions that create marginalization and its effects, and neglecting the many strengths and strategies deployed by these children and youth. This focus can lead to labeling and/or silencing legitimate expressions of resistance and difference in a quest to elicit specific types of behavioral and cultural conformity for students to be deemed "learning ready." This issue explores the sometimes troubling beliefs and assumptions at work in popular social and emotional learning and trauma-informed pedagogies as well as some of the impacts of this new attention. This special issue begins with five articles that describe how implementations of SEL and TIP shape not only the systems they are set in, but the lives of children and youth who are served within them. The subsequent six articles move toward envisioning how educators and practitioners can rethink this work with and for the children and youth who are most profoundly impacted by SEL and TIP frameworks.

AB  - This manual engages young people in the task of helping save their less fortunate peers from hunger and starvation. The activities give students the knowledge to take action on the causes of hunger and their capacity to change the world. Global hunger, caused by the economic and social forces that result in a billion people going to bed hungry on a planet that produces more than enough food is a mystery to most adults. Explanations of global hunger are usually too simple and often wrong. The manual is based on the belief that children can be helped to understand the real causes of hunger and learn to change them. Each lesson leads the student through exercises that teach such things as the pain of hunger, the importance of food, the inequitability of its distribution, the curious lack of relationship between hunger and population density, and the links between poverty, hunger, joblessness, and homelessness in the U.S. and elsewhere. Throughout the lessons, students are asked to read and write, calculate and analyze, role play, and figure out solutions to the problems of global hunger. The manual contains 25 lessons and is divided into three units: (1) "What Is Hunger?"; (2) "Why Are People Hungry?"; and (3) "What Can We Do to Help End Hunger?" (BT)

AB  - In each state, between 41 percent and 91 percent of the homeless students identified by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) are not considered homeless by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Nationwide, as many as 715,238 homeless students fall into a bureaucratic gap between HUD and ED. This is because ED, HUD, and other federal agencies have different definitions of homelessness, which creates a barrier to serving vulnerable homeless children/youth and their families. This fact sheet outlines the differences and explains how the U.S. Congress can close this gap between federal agencies by passing the Homeless Children and Youth Act (H.R. 32). The fact sheet also includes a state-by-state chart of the percentage of students who are considered homeless by ED but not by HUD. (Contains 1 table and 3 endnotes.)

AB  - In this article, I discuss the paradoxes of the body's civilising processes in dialogue with Norbert Elias's sociological theory. As a premise, I contend that modernity's civilising rationality has taken the body, the senses, and emotions in such a fragmented manner that we sometimes lose sight of the dimension that body and person are indivisible. I will analyse the social consequences of the body and person dual concept. In presenting this discussion, the text is divided into three sections. The first, "Education and civilised bodies", analyses the historical movement to standardise behaviours; the second, "Education and inferior bodies", discusses the problem of how to civilise differences; the third, "Education and decivilised rebel bodies", analyses the impact of social movements and the emergence of collective corporality and the body's decivilisation process. The tension amid civilised bodies, the body and person dual concept, and the process of decivilised bodies is so strong that we are now seeing the resurgence of conservative political groups in several countries, including Brazil. This movement has been guided by reactionary demands against social achievements, and is focused directly on the corporality of populations, such as advocacy for the exclusion of immigrants from different ethnic backgrounds and colours; changes in labour rights; and the exacerbation of prejudice against the landless, the homeless, black people, women, and at-risk youths.

Coping strategies examined in the analysis included problem-focused and avoidant coping, along with several coping strategies identified in previous exploratory qualitative studies. Greater risk was associated with avoidant coping, social withdrawal, use of drugs and alcohol as coping, with ''belief in a better future'' linked to lowered risk levels. Gender interactions emerged with respect to avoidant coping and social withdrawal, both of which served as greater contributors to risk levels among females. Several approaches to coping including problem-focused strategies and strategies identified by youths in previous qualitative works emerged as not serving to ameliorate suicidality.

AB  - This study had three aims: (1) to identify stressful situations faced by Indian children and adolescents working on the streets; (2) to study their preference for social support when faced with stress; and (3) to identify gender differences in social support preferences. One hundred 8- to 18-year-olds, working as beggars, vendors, or ragpickers, or who were self-employed, comprised the sample. Observation and interviews were used to identify stressful situations related to the workplace, earnings, home, school, peers, and siblings. A Q-sort technique was used to collect social support preference information. The results indicated that a majority of the children preferred to be alone in most stressful situations, especially those related to the workplace, peers, and parental punishment. They commonly sought their parents' support when they needed money, faced sibling problems, or did household chores. Mothers' support was preferred to fathers', grandparents', and other relatives' support. More boys than girls preferred to be alone in stressful situations, and a larger percentage of girls sought their mothers' support in comparison to the boys. Children's preference for social support provides information on self-reliance, effective survival and coping strategies, the nature of family relationships, the quality of social interactions, and the stressors that street children and adolescents face in difficult circumstances.

AB  - This paper presents findings from a 1991 study that collected descriptive data on over 209 African-American homeless children and youth in Seattle, Washington. A review of the literature indicates that disproportionate numbers of African-Americans are homeless. Discussion in the paper concerns risk factors and conditions that affect African-American families. These include race, poverty, unemployment, lack of marketable skills, social isolation, victimization, psychological pressure, and lack of emotional support for single African-American mothers. Data for the study discussed were gathered as a part of a district evaluation study of homeless children and youth at seven sites that were designated by the district to serve homeless children and youth. Services were intended to: (1) assure homeless children and youth access to schools; (2) provide continuity in education; (3) address basic needs, including food, clothing, shelter, and health care; and (4) provide for children's social, psychological, and educational needs. The findings indicate that African-Americans are over-represented in the homeless population and tend to live with a single-parent mother. It is concluded that the risk factors need to be considered at federal, state, and local levels, and that advocacy efforts for African-American single mothers should focus on providing social and psychological support and educational and employment opportunities. Appended are 11 references and related materials. (GLR)

AB  - Although there have been technological and structural advances in the schools within the past 10 years, the social environment for young people has severely deteriorated. Teenage pregnancy, guns in schools, illegal drugs, homelessness, suicide, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, and unemployment are some of the negative mental and physical conditions that plague today's students. Consequently, more recent restructuring models have proposed the creation of a learning environment which emphasizes both cognitive and affective development. The opportunity for active involvement by school counselors in the current restructuring endeavor is obvious. Counselors, with their unique training in communication skills, problem solving, team and group facilitation, consultation, and coordination, are in positions to play key roles in the current reformation taking place in the schools. It is imperative, however, that counselors thoroughly understand the movement if they are to actively participate. This article clearly defines the restructuring movement and specifically outlines a proposed role for school counselors. Restructuring is defined and major premises of restructuring are reviewed, as are a number of components of restructuring. The counselor's role during the planning, implementation, and evaluation stages of restructuring is described as two-fold: counselors are in a position to manage and coordinate the restructuring movement within the school and to restructure the guidance and counseling program so that it is an integral part of the school system. Finally, special considerations and alternate delivery models are discussed. (NB)

AB  - This Kids Count report investigates county and statewide trends in the well-being of Florida's children. The statistical report is based on indicators of well-being in six areas: (1) child poverty; (2) births, including prenatal care access, infant mortality, low birth weight, and percent of births to unwed mothers; (3) teen parenthood; (4) child and teen safety, including child and teen mortality rates, teen violent deaths, runaways, and children affected by marriage dissolution; (5) education, including non-promotions, disciplinary actions, and high school graduation rate; and (6) youth and the law, including juvenile cases and youths transferred to adult court. The opening section provides information about the study and examines the crisis present among the youngest children in Florida. Section 2 presents statewide trends in demographics and indicators of child well-being. Section 3 presents state and countywide data for each indicator. Findings indicate that Florida ranks 48th in child well-being nationwide. Nearly 25 percent of Florida's children live in poverty. Advances have been made in the infant mortality rate, access to prenatal care, and child and teen violent death rates. Births to teen mothers have increased over 9 percent since 1980. In the last 5 years, the number of school disciplinary actions has increased almost 17 percent and delinquency cases have increased 32 percent. There are considerable racial differences in many of the indicators of well-being. Appendices present county rates for each indicator, racial and age group differences, terminology, and data sources.

AB  - Bridge Builders is a 2-year program intended to develop leadership in high school students. Programmatic goals include enhancing the participants' understanding of other racial and ethnic groups, socioeconomic groups, gender awareness, social responsibility, and the value of community service. Bridge Builders participants confronted community problems such as racial discrimination, homelessness, educational inequity, drug abuse, and poverty. These young leaders are expected to influence others in their schools and communities. Their awareness of and commitment to solving community problems should produce lasting benefits for the society. A survey of former participants (N=151) was conducted to study the impact of the program over its 10-year history. Attitudes of participants with regard to leadership, community service, communications, human relations, and Bridge Builder activities were studied. A set of seven questions inviting comments was also included. A data analysis is provided with demographics, descriptive data on questions, and analysis by gender, race, age, education, and period of involvement. Differences by current vocation (job category) are presented. Answers to the qualitative questions are discussed, and conclusions presented. Overall the program was seen as effective; however, many suggestions for improvements were reported. Recommendations are listed. Includes letter and instrument used to gather data.

AB  - The most popular activities from APA's successful "Activities Handbooks for the Teaching of Psychology" are gathered together and updated in this book of teachers' favorites. The lesson plans, which encourage active learning and involve the whole class, have stood the test of time and proven themselves to be entertaining, effective, and easy to plan. Contributed by psychology teachers nationwide, the activities are most appropriate for courses at the college undergraduate or high school level, yet many are also applicable to more advanced classes. Both beginner and experienced teachers will appreciate the wide variety of teaching techniques described, including demonstrations, experiments, discussions, and simulations. Each lesson plan is presented in an easy cookbook format that lists materials needed, timeframe, instructions, and discussion items. The activities are grouped by topic and cover history, statistics, and research methods; the brain and sensory processes; perception; states of consciousness; learning and memory; thinking, problem-solving, and language; motivation and emotion; developmental psychology; personality; psychological disorders and treatments; social psychology; and race, gender, and multiculturalism. Busy teachers will find themselves turning to this book over and over again for inspiration.

AB  - In conjunction with its fall quarterly meeting, NCD convened a stakeholder forum in Atlanta in October 2014 to receive testimony on the role of special education in the School-to-Prison Pipeline. The findings and recommendations in this report are based upon the culmination of that testimony, interviews with experts, and review of available research. Studies show that up to 85 percent of youth in juvenile detention facilities have disabilities that make them eligible for special education services, yet only 37 percent receive these services while in school. A disproportionate percentage of these detained youth are youth of color. These statistics should lead to the conclusion that many disabled youth in the juvenile justice and criminal justice systems are deprived of an appropriate education that could have changed their School-to-Prison Pipeline trajectory. NCD has concluded that IDEA can and should be an important part of the solution to the School-to-Prison Pipeline crisis. Thus, the recommendations in this report focus on ways to improve existing special education delivery and enforcement systems to better meet the needs of students with disabilities who risk entering the Pipeline. The report includes a participants list of attendees at the NCD Stakeholder Forum to Receive Testimony about the "School-to-Prison Pipeline", Monday, October 6, 2014, Atlanta, GA 30309; List of Acronyms; and Endnotes.

AB  - Despite stereotypes to the contrary, homelessness is as prevalent in rural as urban areas. This digest examines the implications of homelessness for rural children and youth and discusses possible actions by rural educators. An estimated half of the rural homeless are families with children. Compared to urban counterparts, rural homeless families are more likely to be female-headed households and to rely on family and friends rather than social agencies. In addition to lacking physical housing, homeless children are deprived of the emotional security that a home provides. Homeless children may be barred from school by residency requirements or missing records, and may struggle in school due to transience, emotional problems, poor nutrition, poverty-related health problems, domestic violence, or self-destructive behaviors. Homelessness is increasing in the United States as the income gap between rich and poor widens, child poverty increases, and housing costs rise. Schools can address the problems of homeless children by reconsidering attendance and other policies, providing in-school support for projects, and holding professional development workshops that help teachers identify and serve homeless children. Rural educators should compile information on local services and resources available to homeless families and may establish informal support mechanisms. Public policy involvement may be the best long-term strategy for educators. (Contains 10 references and 6 resource organizations.) (SV)

AB  - This article examines the experiences homeless youth face and the influence of social networks on their education. Using a social capital framework, we analyze the experiences that are different for poor youth in general and those homeless. Data used include interviews with 123 homeless youth and more than 40 policymakers, school counselors, and after-school program coordinators. Youth identified three aspects of their lives that influence network development associated with college access: mobility and stability, meeting basic needs, and anonymity and shame. The temporary nature of their residential stability requires a systemic response by educational institutions.

AB  - This book is devoted to interventions that help to make a difference in the lives of children. Children have many challenges, some of which cannot be addressed effectively during the school day. The role of community psychologists has become increasingly important in helping to meet the social and emotional needs of children. This book presents varied interventions, methodologies, and practices with diverse groups of children. Qualitative and quantitative methodologies are used with accompanying case studies as psychologists interact with children in settings as varied as public parks, summer camps, and Kids' College, a Chicago-based program that promotes positive race relations. Chapters include: (1) "Life Imitates (and Informs) Meta-Analysis: A Participatory Approach to Increasing Understanding of Effective Youth Mentoring Practices" (David DuBois); (2) "Evaluation of an Incentive System at a Summer Camp for Youth Experiencing Homelessness" (Laura A.

AB  - The Children's Budget is a comprehensive report on funding for children's services in Colorado. This report provides a six- year funding history for more than 50 programs funded with state, local, and federal dollars. The Colorado Children's Budget analyzes reductions in programs and services during the economic downturn. The data in the Children's Budget sends a clear message that Colorado is falling behind. Children today do not have access to the same opportunities they did just a few years ago. Funding has failed to keep pace with the rapidly growing child population and the rising costs of delivering services. Across the state, service providers have watched their budgets shrink and their service levels decline. They've cut staff, instituted waiting lists, delayed building repairs, reduced their hours, and, in some cases, closed their doors. Funding for some children's services has declined more than others. Mental health, early care and education, local public health services, child care, youth crime prevention services, and income support for working families have suffered the greatest losses. Funding for children's health insurance (Medicaid) and K-12 education, both of which have laws protecting their funding, have grown as more kids in Colorado enroll in public school and more low-income children enroll in Medicaid. Now more than ever, Colorado needs to re-examine its priorities and make the necessary changes to rebuild its social safety net for kids. Appended are: (1) Variables Impacting Funding; and (2) Children's Budget Methodology.

This brief is designed for staff of homeless assistance programs and members of Continuums of Care (CoCs) funded by HUD, as well as for State Coordinators for Homeless Education and local homeless education liaisons who operate under the guidance of ED. The brief provides basic information to help homeless service providers and homeless education staff understand each other's role in supporting children, youth, and families experiencing homelessness, while offering tools to enhance collaboration among agencies.

AB  - As a result of hostile climates for homosexual/bisexual students, dropout rates, substance abuse, homelessness, isolation, and identity problems are growing rapidly. Recent court decisions hold educators and schools responsible for the safety and education of these youth. However, there is no consensus on how to teach such controversial issues to educators. A major obstacle to changing the hostile environment for homosexual/bisexual youth lies within the anti-gay attitudes of educators. Educator training must change the attitudes of teacher trainees and all members of the school community. In order to do this, researchers must measure behavior changes that are believed to result from the training. While case study reports have an emotional appeal, large scale, empirical investigation of the ability to change attitudes and behavior are needed to validate educator trainings. The multitude of questions surrounding the usefulness of training educators in homosexual/bisexual youth issues makes widespread investigation imperative. In order to influence public opinion, these studies must be conducted by individuals who are able to remain completely detached from the study and its results, and they must be done with highly reliable and valid measurements that are above reproach. In order to use research results effectively, researchers must ask how to implement program changes and how to use research data to demonstrate program effectiveness. (Contains 24 references.) (SM)

AB  - This paper compares and analyzes features of the models represented in five efforts to provide coordinated services for children and families located in five cities in an effort to determine how best to study these programs in the future. The programs are: (1) the Minneapolis Youth Trust (Minnesota), a city-wide partnership of member organizations; (2) the Nation of Tomorrow, Chicago (Illinois), a college, community, and school partnership; (3) the School of the Future initiative, Houston (Texas), a project for school-based services; (4) the Family Service Center, Los Angeles (California), a center for school-based services; and (5) A Child's Place, Charlotte (North Carolina), which provides services for homeless children and families. The review of the different program models indicates that, regardless of program specifics, certain areas are essential to a structural analysis. The first is the goal structuring process, and the second is the area of institutional interests and reward systems. The third focus should be on institutional environmental control, and the fourth should be the examination of institutional conventions. Every experiment in children's services coordination should be examined as a point along a process continuum from little or no integration of services to a collaborative ideal by exploring these four institutional characteristics. (Contains 4 tables and 48 references.) (SLD)
