N2  - Importance: Homelessness is a complex challenge with an estimated yearly economic burden of $6 billion in the United States. Mitigating homelessness requires an understanding of determinants of homelessness, their interaction with health factors, and quantification of impact. Objective(s): To investigate the health, social and policy factors influencing homelessness in a longitudinal integrative machine learning analysis. Data Sources and Study design: This retrospective longitudinal study integrated Global Burden of Disease (GBD), Health Inequality, and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) datasets for 3131 counties in the United States. We used the disease burden data of 2014, health inequalities data of 2001-2014, and homelessness count of 2015. Primary Outcome and Measurement Results: Homelessness, the burden of disease, health inequalities, economic policies, ethnic, social, and racial factors. Method(s): Spearman rank correlation test was performed to check pairwise associations. A unified probabilistic model with temporal causality was fitted using a data-driven structure learning algorithm. The resulting associations adjusted for other variables in the network were quantified using network inference algorithms. Finally, counterfactual analysis was performed to quantify the potential impact of the learned interventions. Result(s): The total burden of homelessness was significantly (p<0.001) and positively associated with rates of HIV and hepatitis mortality. Inference from the unified probabilistic model indicated that a state with a high hepatitis mortality rate had a 9% higher homelessness. Further, the rate of rheumatic heart disease mortality had a 29% decrease with the provision of shelter in young adults experiencing homelessness (p<0.001). Finally, states with moderate tax progressivity had a mitigating effect on homelessness as compared to both high and low tax progressivity (2% and 5% respectively). We evaluated the counterfactual impact of policy interventions to provide more support to cancer patients to prevent homeless and provision of shelter to prevent rheumatic heart disease mortality in young adults experiencing homelessness. Conclusion and Relevance: Control of infectious diseases and the implementation of tax policies are critical interventions for the reduction of homelessness in the United States.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - Background: Low income and food insecure households are at risk of poor dietary quality and food insecurity. Especially in childhood, consuming a nutritionally adequate diet is an essential driver of health, growth, and development. Prior research has shown many household-level factors can present challenges to support the nutritional needs of the members of low income and food insecure households. Objective(s): The aim of the scoping review is to identify the contributing factors to dietary quality and food security in U.S. households of school-aged children and synthesize the evidence. Method(s): The scoping review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) using search terms addressing food insecurity, low-income and dietary behaviors in the database PubMed (NCBI). Screening by 3 independent reviewers at the title, abstract, and full study phases identified forty-three studies included in the review. Result(s): The studies addressed six themes: parental behaviors, child/adolescent behaviors, food procurement behaviors, food preparation behaviors, and psychosocial factors. Most studies were cross-sectional (n = 40, 93%) and focused on parental behaviors (n = 24, 56%), followed by food procurement behaviors, and food preparation behaviors. Conclusion(s): The findings can be used to inform the development of future nutritional education interventions aimed at improving the dietary quality and food security in households with children. The themes identified were interrelated and suggest that providing parents with education on the following topics: 1) the importance of modeling positive eating behaviors in the home, 2) approaches to support and encourage positive feeding practices with their children, and 3) practical strategies to overcome barriers to purchasing and preparing foods of high nutrient quality. For example, delivering educational sessions on meal selection and preparation and improving nutritional knowledge hold promise to improve dietary quality among food insecure and low-income households.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

N2  - What is a Rapid Review? Our rapid reviews use a variation of the systematic review approach, abbreviating or omitting some components to generate the evidence to inform stakeholders promptly whilst maintaining attention to bias. They follow the methodological recommendations and minimum standards for conducting and reporting rapid reviews, including a structured protocol, systematic search, screening, data extraction, critical appraisal and evidence synthesis to answer a specific question and identify key research gaps. They take one to two months, depending on the breadth and complexity of the research topic/question(s), the extent of the evidence base and type of analysis required for synthesis. Background / Aim of Rapid Review The COVID-19 pandemic has led to differential economic, health and social impacts illuminating prevailing gender inequalities (WEN Wales, 2020). This rapid review investigated evidence for effectiveness of interventions to address gender inequalities across the domains of work, health, living standards, personal security, participation, and education. Key Findings Extent of the evidence base o 21 studies were identified: 7 reviews, 6 commentaries and 8 primary studies o Limited evidence for the effectiveness of identified innovations in minority groups o A lack of evaluation data for educational interventions o A lack of evidence for cost-effectiveness of the identified interventions o 14 additional articles were identified in the grey literature but not used to inform findings (apart from the Education domain, where there was a lack of peer-reviewed evidence). Recency of the evidence base o All studies were published in 2020-2021 Summary of findings Some evidence supported interventions/innovations related to work: o Permanent contracts, full-time hours, and national childcare programmes to increase income for women and thereby decrease the existing gender wage gap. o More frequent use of online platforms in the presentation of professional work can reduce gender disparities due to time saved in travel away from home. Some evidence supported interventions/innovations related to health: o Leadership in digital health companies could benefit from women developing gender-friendly technology that meets the health needs of women. o Create authentic partnerships with black women and female-led organisations to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality (Bray & McLemore, 2021). Some evidence supported interventions/innovations related to living standards including: o Multi-dimensional care provided to women and their children experiencing homelessness. Limited evidence supported interventions/innovations related to personal security including: o Specific training of social workers, psychologists and therapists to empower women to use coping strategies and utilise services to gain protection from abusive partners. o Helplines, virtual safe spaces smart phone applications and online counselling to address issues of violence and abuse for women and girls. Very limited evidence supported interventions/innovations related to participation including: o Use of online platforms to reduce gender disparities in the presentation of academic/professional work. o Ensuring equal representation, including women and marginalised persons, in pandemic response and recovery planning and decision-making. Limited evidence from the grey literature described interventions/innovations related to education including: o Teacher training curricula development to empower teachers to understand and challenge gender stereotypes in learning environments. o Education for girls to enable participation in STEM. Policy Implications This evidence can be used to map against existing policies to identify which are supported by the evidence, which are not in current policy and could be implemented and where further research/evaluation is needed. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of educational innovations, the effectiveness of the innovations in minority groups and the social value gained from interventions to address gender inequalities. Strength of Evidence One systematic review on mobile interventions targeting common mental disorders among pregnant and postpartum women was rated as high quality (Saad et al., 2021). The overall confidence in the strength of evidence was rated as 'low' due to study designs. Searches did not include COVID specific resources or pre-prints. There may be additional interventions/innovations that have been implemented to reduce inequalities experienced by women and girls due to the COVID-19 pandemic but have not been evaluated or published in the literature and are therefore not included here.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: Cisgender girls and boys report trading sex for something of value at roughly equal proportions; yet, boys are understudied and underserved. We compare boys who reported trading sex to those who never traded sex to address this gap in knowledge and practice. METHOD(S): The study is a secondary analysis of the Minnesota Student Survey, a triannual, census-style survey. The sample included 32 311 cisgender boy students in ninth and 11th grades who answered a question about sex trading. Bivariate descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic models were used to identify associated factors and determine the odds of trading sex on the basis of specific experiences. RESULT(S): We found that 1.2% of boys reported trading sex. In bivariate analyses, boys who reported trading sex were more likely than those who did not to: identify as Black or Indigenous; report a marginalized gender identity or sexual expression; have had sexual intercourse; have experienced sexual harassment and harassment on the basis of sexual identity and race, ethnicity, and national origin; and to have experienced homelessness, food insecurity, foster care, and substance treatment (P < .001). In multivariate models, we found increased odds of trading sex for some variables, including a marginalized sexual identity, identifying as Black, and experiences of unstable housing, foster care, substance treatment, sexual harassment, and harassment based on gender (P < .001). CONCLUSION(S): These findings contribute new knowledge about boys who trade sex using a large, population-based sample and counter false assumptions and stereotypes. These data suggest new avenues of research, intervention, and prevention.Copyright © 2023 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to quantify the degree to which an underserved, Hispanic population in Los Angeles is impacted by SARS-CoV-2, and determine factors associated with paediatric seropositivity. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: AltaMed, a Federally Qualified Health Center in Los Angeles. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of households who had received healthcare at AltaMed Medical Group was invited to participate. Households with at least one adult and one paediatric participant between 5 and 17 years of age were eligible to participate. Consented participants completed a survey on social determinants of health and were tested for antibodies using Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2-IgG and SARS-CoV-2-IgM tests. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Seropositive status. RESULT(S): We analysed 390 adults (mean age in years, 38.98 (SD 12.11)) and 332 paediatric participants (11.26 (SD 3.51)) from 196 households. Estimated seropositivity was 52.11% (95% CI 49.61% to 55.19%) in paediatric participants and 63.58% (95% CI 60.39% to 65.24%) in adults. Seropositivity was 11.47% (95% CI 6.82% to 14.09%) lower in paediatric participants, but high relative to other populations. A household member with type 2 diabetes (OR 2.94 (95% CI 1.68 to 5.14)), receipt of food stamps (OR 1.66 (95% CI 1.08 to 2.56)) and lower head-of-household education (OR 1.73 (95% CI 1.06 to 2.84)) were associated with paediatric seropositivity. CONCLUSION(S): SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity is high in Hispanic children and adolescents in Los Angeles. Food insecure households with low head-of-household education, and at least one household member with type 2 diabetes, had the highest risk. These factors may inform paediatrician COVID-19 mitigation recommendations. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04901624.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Lack of nutritional knowledge and ineffective attitudes can complicate the problems faced by this group of street children and have significant effects on their behaviors. This study aimed to examine the effect of nutrition education on nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of street children in Kerman in 2021. METHOD(S): This experimental study was conducted on 70 street children supported by Aftab Children Support Center in Kerman in 2021. The participants were selected using convenience sampling and were divided into two intervention and control groups using a random number table. A nutrition distance education program was implemented using an educational compact disk (CD) for the participants in the intervention group, while the children in the control group did not receive any training. The children's nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors were assessed before and one month after the intervention using the Nutritional Behavior Questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed with SPSS software (version 22) using the chi-square test, paired and independent samples t-test, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). RESULT(S): The results revealed a significant difference in nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors after the intervention (p<0.001) due to the effect of the nutrition training program. Accordingly, the mean scores of the participants in the intervention group for nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors increased by 11.45, 14.80, and 6.05 units after the intervention compared to their scores before the intervention. Furthermore, the effects of the training program on the participants' nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors were 89.6%, 91.5%, and 64.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): The findings of this study concluded that training based on nutrition education improved the children's nutritional knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Thus, the officials in charge of promoting the health of vulnerable groups in the community need to provide the necessary facilities to implement effective training programs for street children and encourage them to participate in training programs.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - IMPORTANCE People experiencing homelessness are at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Incident infection rates have yet to be established in these communities and are needed to inform infection prevention guidance and related interventions. OBJECTIVE To quantify the SARS-CoV-2 incident infection rate among people experiencing homelessness in Toronto, Canada, in 2021 and 2022 and to assess factors associated with incident infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study was conducted among individuals aged 16 years and older who were randomly selected between June and September 2021 from 61 homeless shelters, temporary distancing hotels, and encampments in Toronto, Canada. EXPOSURES Self-reported housing characteristics, such as number sharing living space. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in summer 2021, defined as self-reported or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or serology-confirmed evidence of infection at or before the baseline interview, and SARS-CoV-2 incident infection, defined as selfreported or PCR- or serology-confirmed infection among participants without history of infection at baseline. Factors associated with infection were assessed using modified Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations. RESULTS The 736 participants (415 of whom did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline and were included in the primary analysis) had a mean (SD) age of 46.1 (14.6) years; 486 (66.0%) selfidentified as male. Of these, 224 (30.4%[95%CI, 27.4%-34.0%]) had a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection by summer 2021. Of the remaining 415 participants with follow-up, 124 experienced infection within 6 months, representing an incident infection rate of 29.9%(95%CI, 25.7%-34.4%), or 5.8% (95%CI, 4.8%-6.8%) per person-month. Report after onset of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant was associated with incident infection, with an adjusted rate ratio (aRR) of 6.28 (95%CI, 3.94-9.99). Other factors associated with incident infection included recent immigration to Canada (aRR, 2.74 [95%CI, 1.64-4.58]) and alcohol consumption over the past interval (aRR, 1.67 [95%CI, 1.12-2.48]). Self-reported housing characteristics were not significantly associated with incident infection. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this longitudinal study of people experiencing homelessness in Toronto, SARS-CoV-2 incident infection rates were high in 2021 and 2022, particularly once the Omicron variant became dominant in the region. Increased focus on homelessness prevention is needed to more effectively and equitably protect these communities.Copyright © 2023 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: People who inject drugs (PWID) have low rates of COVID-19 testing yet are vulnerable to severe disease. In partnership with a mobile syringe service program (SSP) in San Diego County, CA, we developed the evidence-, community-, and Social Cognitive Theory-informed "LinkUP" intervention (tailored education, motivational interviewing, problem-solving, and planning) to increase COVID-19 testing uptake among PWID. PURPOSE: To assess preliminary efficacy of LinkUP in increasing PWID COVID-19 testing in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHOD(S): We referred participants (PWID, >=18 years old, San Diego County residents who had not recently undergone voluntary COVID-19 testing) to mobile SSP sites that had been randomized (by week) to offer the active LinkUP intervention or didactic attention-control conditions delivered by trained peer counselors. Following either condition, counselors offered on-site rapid COVID-19 antigen testing. Analyses estimated preliminary intervention efficacy and explored potential moderation. RESULT(S): Among 150 participants, median age was 40.5 years, 33.3% identified as Hispanic/Latinx, 64.7% were male, 73.3% were experiencing homelessness, and 44.7% had prior mandatory COVID-19 testing. The LinkUP intervention was significantly associated with higher COVID-19 testing uptake (p < .0001). Homelessness moderated intervention effects; LinkUP increased COVID-19 testing uptake more among participants experiencing homelessness (adjusted risk ratio [aRR]: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.56-2.09; p < .0001) than those not experiencing homelessness (aRR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.01-1.43; p = .04). CONCLUSION(S): Findings from this pilot RCT support the preliminary efficacy of the "LinkUP" intervention to increase COVID-19 testing among PWID and underscore the importance of academic-community partnerships and prevention service delivery through SSPs and other community-based organizations serving vulnerable populations.Copyright © The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - Aims: Youth experiencing homelessness and mental health issues face many challenges in accessing and engaging in mental health services The Montreal Homeless Youth Network (MHYN) located in Montreal Canada, brings together several community and institutional organizations helping youth living in precarious situations Methods: Within the pan-Canadian transformational study ACCESSOpen Minds, we used mixed methods to develop a broad understanding of the complex issues faced by homeless youth to access and engage in mental health services. Factors associated with delays and process for accessing care were documented. Focus groups were conducted with homeless youth, care workers, and service administrators Results: Between 2016 and 2021, 683 young people aged between 14 and 26 years initiated a request within the MHYN regarding their mental health needs. The needs assessment with a care worker was completed in less than 1 week for more than 75% of the participants but the capacity to maintain regular contacts for the follow-up remained an issue. More than half of them were experiencing homelessness and almost all of them (95%) where having difficulties meeting their basic needs (housing, food, and clothing). Youth from visible minorities accounted for 37% and some groups were overrepresented among homelessness youth from the LGBTQ+ community (42%) young people who had previous contacts with youth protection services (58%) and/or had issues with the justice system (50%) Conclusions. Engagement with services fluctuates and is linked to precarious living conditions, lack of stable housing, substance misuse and support during the process of accessing services.

N2  - National mental health surveys play a critical role in determining the prevalence of mental disorders in a population and informing service planning. However, current surveys have important limitations, including the exclusion of key vulnerable groups and increasing rates of non-response. This review aims to synthesise information on excluded and undersampled groups in national mental health surveys. We conducted a targeted review of nationally representative adult mental health surveys performed between 2005 and 2019 in high-income OECD countries. Sixteen surveys met our inclusion criteria. The response rate for included surveys ranged between 36.3% and 80.0%. The most frequently excluded groups included people who were homeless, people in hospitals or health facilities and people in correctional facilities. Males and young people were the most commonly underrepresented groups among respondents. Attempts to collect data from non-responders and excluded populations were limited, but suggest that mental health status differs among some of these cohorts. The exclusion of key vulnerable groups and high rates of non-response have important implications for interpreting and using the results of national mental health surveys. Targeted supplementary surveys of excluded or hard-to-reach populations, more inclusive sampling methodologies, and strategies aimed at improving response rates should be considered to strengthen the accuracy and usefulness of survey findings.Copyright © 2023.

N2  - The dominant narrative in mental health policy and practice has shifted in the 21st century from one of chronic ill health to a 'recovery' orientation. Knowledge of recovery is based on narratives of people with lived experience of mental distress. However the narratives of people experiencing structural inequalities are under-represented in recovery research. Meanwhile, uses of recovery narratives have been critiqued by survivor-researchers as a co-option of lived experience to serve neoliberal agendas. To address these twin concerns, we undertook a performative narrative analysis of two 'recovery narratives' of people with multiple and complex needs, analysing their co-construction at immediate/micro and structural/macro levels. We found two contrasting responses to the invitation to tell a recovery story: a narrative of personal lack and a narrative of resistance. We demonstrate through reflexive worked examples how the genre of recovery narrative, focused on personal transformation, may function to occlude structural causes of mental distress and reinforce personal responsibility in the face of unchanging living conditions. We conclude that unacknowledged epistemological assumptions may contribute to co-constructing individualist accounts of recovery. A critical, reflexive approach, together with transparent researcher positionality, is imperative to avoid the epistemic injustice of a decontextualised form of recovery narrative.Copyright © 2023 The Authors

N2  - OBJECTIVE: As part of a larger community-based, service-driven research project, the primary purpose of this pilot randomized study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of delivering time-limited adaptations of parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT) and child-parent psychotherapy (CPP) within a sample of children experiencing homelessness. The secondary goal was to examine the promise of both interventions in improving parent/child outcomes. METHOD(S): One hundred forty-four young children (18 month-5 years old; Mage = 3.48, SD = 1.09; 43.1% female; 78.5% Black/African American; 27.1% Hispanic) and their mothers were recruited from a women's homeless shelter and randomly assigned to 12 weeks of either PCIT or CPP delivered by shelter clinicians on-site. Attendance, fidelity, and program satisfaction were obtained. Families completed pre- and postintervention assessments, including observational data on maternal verbalizations during a child-led play session. RESULT(S): Both time-limited PCIT and time-limited CPP were successfully implemented with similarly high levels of intervention fidelity (>90%) and satisfaction by mothers (85%). Completion rates were similar across both time-limited PCIT (76.6%) and time-limited CPP (71.4%). Both time-limited CPP and PCIT resulted in decreases in children's posttraumatic stress, parental stress, and increases in maternal positive verbalizations. Only time-limited PCIT resulted in significant improvements in externalizing behavior problems in children and reductions in maternal negative verbalizations. CONCLUSION(S): Time-limited PCIT and CPP are acceptable, feasible, and hold significant promise for helping families within a homeless shelter environment and by extension, other transitional and/or shelter environments. A full randomized trial is warranted to determine which program may offer a more effective intervention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).

N2  - Low income and food insecure households are at risk of poor dietary quality and even more severe food insecurity. Especially in childhood, consuming a nutritionally adequate diet is an essential driver of health, growth, and development. Household-level factors can present challenges to support the nutritional needs of low income and food insecure household members. The aim of this scoping review is to identify the contributing household factors to dietary quality and food security in U.S. households of school-aged children 5 to 19 years and synthesize the evidence around emergent themes for application to future interventions. The scoping review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols Extension for Scoping Reviews using search terms addressing food insecurity, low income, and dietary behaviors in the database PubMed. Screening by 3 independent reviewers at the title, abstract, and full study phases identified forty-four studies. The five themes around which the studies grouped were: parental behaviors, child/adolescent behaviors, food procurement behaviors, food preparation behaviors, and household environment factors. Most studies were cross-sectional (n = 41, 93%) and focused on parental behaviors (n = 31, 70%), followed by food preparation and procurement behaviors. The themes identified were interrelated and suggest that incorporating education on parent and child behaviors that influence food procurement and preparation, along with strengthening organization and planning in the household environment, may hold promise to improve dietary quality and food security among food insecure and low income households. Findings can be used to inform future nutrition education interventions aimed at improving the dietary quality and food security in households with school-aged children.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

N2  - Introduction: In the United States, adverse birth outcomes are most prevalent among Black women and birthing people, who are known to experience increased mistreatment and disrespect in care. The purpose of this paper is to describe findings from a study that used two validated scales to examine factors associated with experiences of person-centered care during pregnancy and birth among Black birthing people in California. Method(s): We used data from 234 Black women and birthing people who were recruited between January and September 2020 as part of a validation study for the Person-Centered Prenatal Care (PCPC) and the Person-Centered Maternity Care (PCMC-US) scales. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to examine the associations between PCPC and PCMC-US scores and sociodemographic, health-related, and care-related factors. Result(s): The factors associated with lower PCPC scores were having foreign-born parents, having public or no insurance, part-time employment, unstable housing, late start of prenatal care (in the second or third trimester), poorer self-rated health (less than very good), and lack of continuity of care with prenatal providers. Factors associated with lower PCMC-US scores were having public insurance, late start of prenatal care, longer length of stay in facility following birth, poorer self-rated health, lack of continuity of care between prenatal care and birth providers, and racial discordance with birth provider. Conclusion(s): Our analysis highlights the contributions of intersecting identities as well as health-related and care-related factors to Black birthing people's experiences of care in California. Continuity of care and provider racial concordance, in particular, were shown to improve pregnancy and birth experiences.Copyright © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - There is a dearth of effective, evidence-based programming to support youth experiencing homelessness, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where the majority of these young people live. Programs focused on youth engagement and leadership appear to be promising means to effectively engage and promote positive outcomes in this population. By Youth for Youth (BYFY) is a peer-led youth leadership framework developed to promote youth engagement, empowerment, and skill development. To date, BYFY has been successfully implemented with promising process and outcome indicators for youth experiencing homelessness, both in Toronto and with Indigenous youth in Thunder Bay. In this article, we present the application of BYFY with 30 street-involved youth in Managua, Nicaragua. We highlight the key implementation factors leading to BYFY's success in Nicaragua as perceived by facilitators from the implementing organization, Covenant House International, and youth leaders. Using a General Inductive analysis of interview data, field notes, and artistic output generated by the project (rap video, graffiti art, street theater), we identify the processes that appeared to underlie positive outcomes observed in participants, including creating a sense of safety and providing opportunities to challenge negative self-perceptions. This article provides evidence for a scaleable model for youth engagement and empowerment that (a) is practical to implement in low-resource settings and (b) is effective at engaging street-involved youth across diverse cultures and contexts. We summarize practical implications and actionable measures that can be taken by stakeholders to capitalize on these findings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).

T1  - Assessing behavioral economic biases among young adults who have increased likelihood of acquiring HIV: a mixed methods study in Baltimore, Maryland

N2  - Background: Behavioral economic (BE) biases have been studied in the context of numerous health conditions, yet are understudied in the field of HIV prevention. This aim of this study was to quantify the prevalence of four common BE biases-present bias, information salience, overoptimism, and loss aversion-relating to condom use and HIV testing in economically-vulnerable young adults who had increased likelihood of acquiring HIV. We also qualitatively examined participants' perceptions of these biases. Method(s): 43 participants were enrolled in the study. Data were collected via interviews using a quantitative survey instrument embedded with qualitative questions to characterize responses. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using descriptive statistics and deductive-inductive content analyses. Result(s): 56% of participants were present-biased, disproportionately discounting future rewards for smaller immediate rewards. 51% stated they were more likely to spend than save given financial need. Present-bias relating to condom use was lower with 28% reporting they would engage in condomless sex rather than wait one day to access condoms. Most participants (72%) were willing to wait for condom-supported sex given the risk. Only 35% knew someone living with HIV, but 67% knew someone who had taken an HIV test, and 74% said they often think about preventing HIV (e.g., high salience). Yet, 47% reported optimistically planning for condom use, HIV discussions with partners, or testing but failing to stick to their decision. Most (98%) were also averse (b = 9.4, SD +/-.9) to losing their HIV-negative status. Qualitative reasons for sub-optimal condom or testing choices were having already waited to find a sex partner, feeling awkward, having fear, or not remembering one's plan in the moment. Optimal decisions were attributed qualitatively to self-protective thoughts, establishing routine care, standing on one's own, and thinking of someone adversely impacted by HIV. 44% of participants preferred delayed monetary awards (e.g., future-biased), attributed qualitatively to fears of spending immediate money unwisely or needing time to plan. Conclusion(s): Mixed methods BE assessments may be a valuable tool in understanding factors contributing to optimal and sub-optimal HIV prevention decisions. Future HIV prevention interventions may benefit from integrating savings products, loss framing, commitment contracts, cues, or incentives.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Homelessness during pregnancy is associated with poorer health, wellbeing and social welfare outcomes for women and their children. Experiences include child protection involvement and, in some cases, removal of children from the family unit. This systematic review investigated the impact of housing support during pregnancy on child protection outcomes. Method(s): Data sources: CINAHL, SocIndex. Study selection: Housing interventions delivered to homeless women during pregnancy; high-income countries; child protection outcomes; published in the English language from 2000 to July 2022. Data extraction: Following independent double-screening of 850 studies, 18 full-texts were reviewed, and one eligible study identified. Result(s): The single study was low-quality, with a small cohort and no control group. In a post-hoc secondary analysis, six other studies met all inclusion criteria except the child protection outcome. Findings from these interventions indicated faster initial improvements in housing, alcohol use and mental health service engagement, and improvements in child internalising and externalising behaviours, compared with controls. High-quality studies with robust intervention designs are lacking. There were insufficient data to conduct a meta-analysis. Conclusion(s): There are promising indications that housing interventions can generate benefits to homeless clients who are pregnant or women with young children. However, rigorous evidence is lacking, and there is none focusing on child protection outcomes. This reflects the challenges of conducting randomised trials in this setting. Given the importance of pregnancy and early childhood circumstances on child development and life chances, evaluations of existing housing programs, and novel trials of large-scale housing policy implementation, should be prioritised.

N2  - Introduction: Since the beginning of COVID 19 pandemic, more than 641 million cases and 6.63 million confirmed deaths were reported worldwide. A rapid development of COVID 19 Vaccine was the breakthrough in the prevention and control of COVID 19. India has commenced its vaccination drive from January 16, 2021 and has administered more than 219 crores vaccination to date it its people. On war foot, Reliance Industries Limited also launched its free vaccination coverage program - Mission Vaccine Suraksha for employees, family members, and community by collaborating with local authorities and governments. The organization also provided free vaccination to Kerala, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra besides various other national and regional organisations to speed up the vaccination drive. Methodology: A taskforce including stakeholders form the Medical Services, HR, Procurement, Logistics, transportation, digital systems was formed to oversee, implement, monitor, and evaluate a successful vaccine roll-out drive. The drive included Covishield and Covaxin COVID 19 vaccines. As a single point of contact, Reliance Foundation HN Hospital procured, stored, and transported vaccines to all locations. At par with Govt. protocols, Reliance developed its own workplace COVID vaccination centres (CVCs) at its corporate headquarters and 11 other manufacturing sites in Maharashtra and Gujrat. For Cold chain management, Reliance procured Ice Lined Refrigerators (ILRs), refrigerators, vaccine carriers, icepacks, etc. for each CVC. Dedicated medical and paramedical staffs were recruited and trained to carry out vaccination drive with all the COVID 19 protocols in place. Reliance tied up with multiple hospitals to carry out pan-India vaccination drive. The entire operation was digitally enabled by involving mediums such as Reliance's in-house app JioHealthHub (JHH) that included end-to-end vaccination journey, i.e., from slot booking, CoWIN registration, post-vaccination care, uploading of the certificates, etc. Vaccine inventory was monitored by Reliance's digital system named KiviHealth. A vaccination dashboard was created to track real time vaccination update. Result(s): 40 lakh vaccine doses were provided free of cost to support the nationwide vaccination programme. Till date, 31,63,870 beneficiaries were covered under R-Suraksha under which, 15,94,357 people received their 1st dosage, 13,36,613 received the 2nd dose, and 2,32,900 people have received the precautionary dose. Reliance also commenced vaccination for children aged 12 to 17 years covering 7369 children for 1st dose, 5802 children for 2nd dose. Reliance has achieved 100% compliance for 2 doses of COVID 19 vaccination for its employees and contract workers across manufacturing units. Precautionary dose was administered to 75% of employees and contract workers to date. 25 mild and 3 moderate Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) cases were recorded during vaccination at workplace CVCs, which were managed and sent home. Conclusion(s): Reliance's Mission Vaccine Suraksha has reached to all corners of the country, including people with disabilities, the elderly, homeless, and those in far-flung locations. Reliance faced hurdles in procuring and storing of the vaccines at the beginning of the operation. However, this was tackled effectively with strategic approach. The initiative is still ongoing ensuring maximum precautionary dosage coverage for everyone.

N2  - A 2012 Massachusetts shelter eligibility regulation required many families to spend a night in a location "not meant for human habitation" before qualifying for the state-run shelter system, and many families experiencing homelessness stayed in pediatric emergency departments (EDs) overnight to meet this requirement. ED clinicians initially recognized an increase in ED visits for homelessness after this regulation and began compiling and sharing stories with key institutional and community partners and stakeholders. To bolster advocacy efforts, the authors collected data on the magnitude of the problem and its associated health care costs. Guided by the policy knowledge of community partners, the authors leveraged the expertise and advocacy power of clinicians to share these data and stories with legislators via written and oral testimony, community events, and the media. Academic publication lent additional credibility and exposure to their research. In 2019, the Massachusetts Legislature passed budget language to overturn the 2012 shelter eligibility regulation. However, despite this policy victory, some families continue to present to EDs for homelessness. Therefore, current advocacy efforts have shifted focus toward implementation and enforcement of the new policy, monitoring issues, and developing new programmatic responses. In this advocacy case study, we illustrate how clinicians have unique abilities to serve as effective advocates for social policy change using a framework of strategies including storytelling, coalition building, tailored communication, and data sharing. Partnering with existing advocacy networks within their institution and community enhances the advocacy efforts of all stakeholders to influence social and health outcomes for children and families.Copyright © 2023 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Permanent supportive housing (PSH) integrates long-term housing and supports for families and individuals experiencing homelessness. Although PSH is frequently provided to families with children, little is known about the impacts of PSH among children. We examined changes in health care visits among children receiving PSH compared with similar children who did not receive PSH. METHOD(S): We analyzed Pennsylvania Medicaid administrative data for children entering PSH between 2011 and 2016, matching to a comparison cohort with similar demographic and clinical characteristics who received non-PSH housing services. We conducted propensity score-weighted difference-in-differences (DID) analyses to compare changes in health care visits 3 years before and after children entered PSH versus changes in the comparison cohort. RESULT(S): We matched 705 children receiving PSH to 3141 in the comparison cohort. Over 3 years following PSH entry, dental visits among children entering PSH increased differentially relative to the comparison cohort (DID: 12.70 visits per 1000 person-months, 95% confidence interval: 3.72 to 21.67). We did not find differential changes in preventive medicine visits, hospitalizations, or emergency department (ED) visits overall. When stratified by age, children #5 years old at PSH entry experienced a greater decrease in ED visits relative to the comparison cohort (DID: 13.16 visits per 1000 person-months, 95% confidence interval: 26.23 to 0.10). However, emergency visit trends before PSH entry differed between the cohorts. CONCLUSION(S): Children in PSH had relatively greater increases in dental visits, and younger children entering PSH may have experienced relative reductions in ED visits. Policymakers should consider benefits to children when evaluating the overall value of PSH.Copyright © 2023 American Academy of Pediatrics. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Although research on HIV self-testing (HIVST) has rapidly increased, few studies have explored HIVST uptake in female sex workers (FSW), and none in Malaysia. Therefore, we endeavored to assess the willingness to use HIVST in this at-risk, vulnerable population. Method(s): A cross-sectional survey study was conducted among 113 HIV-negative Malaysian FSW in 2017. Participants were recruited using advertisements on social media, flyers, and direct referrals from community-based organizations. Data were collected using self-administered surveys. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify correlates of willingness to use HIVST. Result(s): Nearly a third of participants (30.1%) reported they would be willing to use HIVST. Multivariable analyses adjusting for Malay ethnicity, stable housing, living in Kuala Lumpur (KL), years in sex work, age of first sex work, childhood sexual assault, history of HIV testing, and previously in prison indicated that living in KL [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 5.214, p = 0.0137] was associated with a greater willingness to use HIVST. In contrast, having stable housing (aOR = 0.100, p = 0.0064) was negatively associated with willingness to use HIVST. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that HIVST may potentially enhance the uptake of HIV testing among FSWs living in an urban environment and experiencing unstable housing, but an overall willingness to use HIVST is low. These findings highlight the need for efforts to increase awareness of HIVST among FSWs and additional research on the effective implementation of HIVST for FSW.Copyright © 2023 Kim, Wickersham, Maviglia, Galka, Azwa, Gautam and Shrestha.

N2  - Pregnant and parenting women who use substances report high rates of comorbid depression and anxiety. Due to the significant impact of this comorbidity on treatment adherence and maternal/child outcomes, effective psychosocial and behavioral interventions to address depression and anxiety in this population are necessary. A directed search of PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases produced 22 articles from 20 distinct studies examining non-pharmacologic interventions with an effect on depression and anxiety among pregnant or parenting women using substances. Of the 20 studies reviewed, 8 were randomized controlled trials, 7 were quasi-experimental studies, and 5 were cohort studies. Results revealed a wide array of interventions targeting intrapersonal, interpersonal, and/or structural factors within these women's lives. Parenting therapy and psychosocially enhanced treatment programs had the strongest evidence for positive treatment effect in improving symptoms of depression and anxiety. The use of contingency-management, case-managed care, patient or wellness navigators, mindfulness-based therapy, maternal-child relationship-focused therapy, family therapy, peer support, and therapeutic community-based interventions show promise but warrant further experimental exploration. Comprehensive and gender-specific residential treatment was observationally associated with improvements in depression and anxiety; however, the specific modality of efficacy is unclear. Future research should focus on identifying which modalities are most cost-effective, feasible, and acceptable among this uniquely vulnerable population.Copyright © 2021

N2  - Background: Disruptions from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic potentially exacerbated food insecurity among adults and youth. Objective(s): The objective was to examine changes in the prevalence and severity of food insecurity among adults and youth from before (2019) to during (2020) the pandemic in multiple countries. Method(s): Repeated cross-sectional data were collected among adults aged 18-100 y (n = 63,278) in 5 countries in November to December in 2018-2020 and among youth aged 10-17 y (n = 23,107) in 6 countries in November to December in 2019 and 2020. Food insecurity in the past year was captured using the Household Food Security Survey Module and the Child Food Insecurity Experiences Scale. Changes in the prevalence and severity of food insecurity were examined using logistic and generalized logit regression models, respectively. Models included age, gender, racial-ethnic identity, and other sociodemographic characteristics associated with food insecurity to adjust for possible sample differences across waves. Models were weighted to reflect each country's population. Result(s): Adults [adjusted OR (AOR): 1.15; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.31] and youth (AOR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.19, 1.71) in Mexico were more likely to live in food-insecure households in 2020 compared to 2019. Adults in Australia (AOR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.92) and Canada (AOR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.99) were less likely to live in food-insecure households in 2020. Trends in severity aligned with changes in prevalence, with some exceptions. Youth in Australia (AOR: 2.24; 95% CI: 1.65, 3.02) and the United States (AOR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.86) were more likely to have many compared with no experiences of food insecurity in 2020 compared to 2019. There was no evidence of change among adults and youth in the remaining countries. Conclusion(s): Except for Mexico, few changes in food insecurity among adults and youth were observed from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic. Action is needed to support households at risk of food insecurity.Copyright © 2023 American Society for Nutrition

N2  - Introduction: Smoking rates are alarmingly high among young people experiencing homelessness (YEH), yet there are no evidence-based cessation programs for this population. This paper presents results from a pilot evaluation of a text messaging-based smoking cessation treatment, as an adjunct to brief group cessation counseling, to improve abstinence rates among 18-25-year-old smokers experiencing homelessness.The goal of this study was to estimate effect sizes for a larger trial and it was not powered to detect group differences. Aims and Methods: YEH smokers who had a working cell phone with them at recruitment were randomized to receive a group counseling session, nicotine patches, and written material on quitting (n = 37) or a similar program that also included a 6-week automated text messaging intervention (TMI) to provide ongoing support for quitting (n = 40). Smoking outcomes were evaluated through a 90-day follow-up. Result(s): Seven-day point prevalence abstinence at 90-day follow-up was higher in theTMI condition than standard condition (17.50% vs. 8.11%, respectively; Cohen's h = .37); however, the 90-day continuous abstinence rate was not statistically different from zero in either condition. Reductions in the number of days smoked in the past 30 days from baseline to follow-up were greater in the TMI condition than the standard condition (-14.24 vs. -8.62, respectively; Cohen's d = .49). Conclusion(s): Adding a 6-week TMI support to a brief group counseling and pharmacotherapy protocol holds promise for smoking reduction and abstinence amongYEH smokers. Results indicate that further development and evaluation of theTMI in this population is warranted. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03874585. Registered March 14, 2019, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03874585. Implications: This is the first study to evaluate the feasibility of using a text messaging-based intervention (TMI) for behavior change with 18-25 year olds experiencing homelessness, and more specifically, the first to test aTMI to provide ongoing support for smoking cessation. Small to medium effect sizes for theTMI are promising in terms of implementing aTMI using participants' own cell phones, as well as the efficacy of this approach as an adjunct to standard care (brief group counseling and pharmacotherapy) for smoking cessation amongYEH.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - Background - The new increasing homeless lately consist of women, children, youth, the elderly and marginalized ethnic or migrant groups. Some of them are working and earn salaries, however, the income is not sufficient to live modestly. Purpose - The purpose of this research is to establish a desired support system to eradicate urban homelessness in the country. Design/methodology/approach - This is an exploratory descriptive method study which employed quantitative techniques. The study employed a social ecological model to investigate behavior of homeless via multiple levels of influences including intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community and public policy. Surveys have been conducted on sixty-five homeless individuals. Findings - It was found that support systems and structures should be derived from the whole streams from families, communities, organizations and government. Employment opportunities, long-term shelters within the community places and highly demanded skills are needed to improve their living condition. Research limitations - This study is only focused on the socio-economic structures of the homeless in a capital city. Originality/value - This is an empirical research using a social ecological model for the homeless in the Kuala Lumpur area. Research on homeless study has received little attention and has yet to be fully explored.Copyright: © 2022 Mohd Rom NA et al.

N2  - Street children are among the most marginalized children, globally, who experience severe violations of their rights and face multiple deprivations. This study aimed to describe street children's characteristics and working conditions in Iran. Method(s): This cross-sectional rapid survey was conducted from March to May 2017 in six major cities in Iran. The sample group consisted of Iranian and non-Iranian girls and boys, aged 10 to 18, who worked on the streets for at least one month prior to the survey. Time-location based sampling was used. A total of 856 Children were randomly selected from 464 venues, including corners of streets, parks, metro gates, bus stations, shopping malls, and shopping centers frequented by street children. Result(s): Findings showed that 90% of participants were boys, 60% were between 10 and 14 years old, almost 50% attended school, 12% were illiterate, and 32% had quit school. Children of Afghan nationality comprised 54% of the study participants, and the rest were Iranian. Of all participants, 85% resided with family or relatives. Most children (75.5%) worked more than 5 h daily, and vending (71.2%) and waste picking (16.1%) were common activities. Street children suffered, mainly, from harsh weather (22.7%), insults and beatings of everyday people (21%), starvation (20.7%), and police repression (15.4%). More than half of the study participants were not involved in intervention programs, and just 7% of them had attended any health education programs. Conclusion(s): Street children reported little to no service use, which may contribute to poor health. Street children require immediate attention to improve their wellbeing. Decision-makers and academicians should collaborate on intervention development research to design appropriate health and social interventions targeted at street children.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Purpose of reviewIn this article, we outline an up-to-date overview of the climate change impact on mental health of urban population, conducted by searching the PubMed database for relevant studies published in the past 12-18 months, in English.Recent findingsClimate change is part of a larger systemic ecological problem in which human demands are exceeding the regenerative capacity of the biosphere. We are witnessing a 'climate chaos', a phase of instability and transformation, which is leading humans into a psychological condition of 'systemic insecurity' and a shared feeling of uncertainty. Currently, one of the places where our species is particularly exposed to climate change are cities, due to build-up in urban infrastructure, rapid and chaotic urbanization, high densities and recent rapid growth, social inequality, and 'heat island effect'.The impact of climate change on cities exposes vulnerable groups to the worse mental health consequences. These groups include the homelessness, slum dwellers for whom the 'neighbourhood effects' are being discussed, climate refugees and migrants, young people, and finally those who assist these people.SummaryIn order to realize broader mental health prevention in cities exposed to climate change phenomena, public health approaches are needed. Institutions must avoid reinforcing inequalities among the more vulnerable groups or create new inequalities.Copyright © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Food insecurity is a pressing global challenge with far-reaching consequences for health and well-being. However, little attention has focused specifically on the experiences of children and adolescents over the age of 5 y in food insecure households. Objective(s): We examine whether the persistence and severity of household food insecurity are negatively associated with children's educational outcomes. Method(s): We used data for the younger cohort of the longitudinal Young Lives data from rounds 3 (2009), 4 (2013), and 5 (2016), when children were aged 8 y, 12 y, and 15 y, respectively. Drawing on the Household Food Insecurity and Access Scale, we used descriptive statistics, graphical analysis, and multilevel regressions to document how the persistence and severity of household food insecurity are associated with children's educational outcomes (years of education, maths, and vocabulary [PPVT] test scores). We controlled for potentially confounding sociodemographic characteristics, including children's own baseline grade attained and test scores in "value-added" models, to provide robust estimates of household food insecurity in predicting children's educational outcomes. Result(s): Household food insecurity generally declined between 2009 and 2016. Fewer than 50% of households were food secure across the 3 rounds of data we examined. Our robust, multivariate, value-added models show that the persistence and severity of food insecurity are negatively associated with all 3 children's educational outcomes we examined. Conclusion(s): We add to a small but growing literature exploring how household food insecurity is associated with children's educational outcomes in the Global South. Our findings on severity of food insecurity highlight the importance of understanding food insecurity along the severity continuum rather than as a dichotomous state, as previously done in existing literature. Addressing household food insecurity in childhood and adolescence may be a key factor to improve children's educational outcomes.Copyright © 2023 The Authors

N2  - Good mental health is a critical resource for mothers and caregivers of young children, given the central role of mental health in enabling responsive caregiving. However, fulfilling caregiving responsibilities under challenging circumstances such as extreme poverty, food insecurity, and gender inequality intensifies vulnerability to poor mental health. Previous research focuses on mental health of mothers, while in many LMICs children are cared for by other caregivers, such as grandparents. We examined the prevalence of mental health problems among primary caregivers of young children in rural Lesotho, and investigated factors associated with these mental health problems. We analysed baseline data from a cluster randomised controlled trial, where all caregivers with children between 1 and 5 years old across 34 villages were invited to participate. The analysis included mental health data from 781 caregivers of 998 children. We assessed caregiver mental health using three self-report screening instruments. Univariate and multivariate regression modelling tested associations between caregiver, child and household variables and (1) depression symptoms (PHQ-9), (2) anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), (3) psychological distress (SRQ-20), (4) suicidal ideation and (5) help-seeking for mental health. This study reported a high prevalence of symptoms of psychological distress (46.2%), depression (25.7%), anxiety (17.1%) and suicidal ideation (27.5%) among caregivers. Greater prevalence was associated with food insecurity, parenting stress or recent death in the family/household. Older caregivers reported higher rates of psychological distress and depression, while younger caregivers reported higher rates of anxiety. Suicidal ideation was associated with greater food insecurity and parenting stress, and lower caregiver education. Our findings support the need to address intersecting public health issues to improve conditions for caregivers in these settings. Targeting modifiable risk factors such as food insecurity among individuals within a society who carry disproportionate burdens of caregiving should be prioritised, especially in contexts of scarcity, where mental health is not prioritised.Copyright © 2022 The Authors

N2  - Background: The effect of different types of care environment on orphaned and separated children and adolescents' (OSCA) experiences of abuse in sub-Saharan Africa is uncertain. Objective(s): Our two primary objectives were 1) to compare recent child abuse (physical, emotional, and sexual) between OSCA living in institutional environments and those in family-based care; and 2) to understand how recent child abuse among street-connected children and youth compared to these other vulnerable youth populations. Participants and setting: This project followed a cohort of OSCA in Uasin Gishu County, Kenya (2009-2019). This analysis includes 2393 participants aged 18 years and below, 1017 from institutional environments, 1227 from family-based care, and 95 street-connected participants. Method(s): The primary outcome of interest was recent abuse. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of recent abuse at baseline, follow-up, and chronically for each abuse domain and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) between care environments, controlling for multiple factors. Result(s): In total, 47 % of OSCA reported ever experiencing any kind of recent abuse at baseline and 54 % in follow-up. Compared to those in family-based care, street-connected participants had a much higher reported prevalence of all types of recent abuse at baseline (AOR: 5.01, 95 % CI: 2.89, 9.35), in follow-up (AOR: 5.22, 95 % CI: 2.41, 13.98), and over time (AOR: 3.44, 95 % CI: 1.93, 6.45). OSCA in institutional care were no more likely than those in family-based care of reporting any recent abuse at baseline (AOR: 0.85 95 % CI: 0.59-1.17) or incident abuse at follow-up (AOR: 0.91, 95 % CI: 0.61-1.47). Conclusion(s): OSCA, irrespective of care environment, reported high levels of recent physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. Street-connected participants had the highest prevalence of all kinds of abuse. OSCA living in institutional care did not experience more child abuse than those living in family-based care.Copyright © 2021 The Authors

N2  - Background: The experience of homelessness and child protection involvement pose risks to children's school success. Elucidating processes by which these interrelated systems affect child well-being is important for guiding policy and practice. Objective(s): This study examines the temporal relation between emergency shelter or transitional housing use and child protection involvement among school-aged children. We evaluated effects of both risk indicators on school attendance and school mobility. Participant and setting: Using integrated administrative data, we identified 3278 children (ages 4 to 15) whose families used emergency or transitional housing in Hennepin and Ramsey County of Minnesota during the 2014 and 2015 academic years. A propensity-score-matched comparison group of 2613 children who did not use emergency or transitional housing. Method(s): Through a series of logistic regressions and generalized estimating equations, we tested the temporal associations of emergency/transitional housing and child protection involvement as well as how both experiences affected school attendance and mobility. Result(s): Experiences of emergency or transitional housing often proceeded or occurred concurrently with child protection involvement and increased the likelihood of child protection services. Emergency or transitional housing and child protection involvement posed risks for lower school attendance and greater school mobility. Conclusion(s): A multisystem approach to assist families across social services may be important for stabilizing children's housing and bolstering their success at school. A two-generation approach focused on residential and school stability and enhancing family resources could boost adaptive success of family members across contexts.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Background: The prevalence of food insecurity and its relationship to diet quality are factors impacting the health of persons living across the United States-affiliated Pacific region (USAP). Objective(s): The aim of this study was to describe characterize the relationship between household food security status and diet quality of 2- to 8-y-old children across jurisdictions in the USAP. Method(s): Baseline data from 2- to 8-y-olds (n = 3099) enrolled in the Children's Healthy Living Program for Remote Underserved Minority Populations in the Pacific region, an obesity prevention study conducted in communities across Alaska, American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Guam, and Hawaii, and a concomitant prevalence study in communities across the Freely Associated States (FAS) (the Federated States of Micronesia: Kosrae, Pohnpei, Chuuk, Yap; Republic of Marshall Islands; Republic of Palau) were collected in 2012. Caregivers self-reported sociodemographic data and food insecurity. Assisted by their caregiver, children completed two dietary records on nonconsecutive, randomly assigned days. The Healthy Eating Index 2005 (HEI-2005) was used to assess the diet quality. Data were summarized overall and by jurisdiction. Differences in HEI-2005 and HEI component scores among jurisdictions and by household food security status were tested using 1-factor ANOVA. Result(s): Half or more of participants from American Samoa, Guam, CNMI, and FAS reported household food insecurity (n = 295, 59.7%; n = 292, 49.9%; n = 267, 54.6%; n = 572, 69.0%, respectively). HEI-2005 scores varied by jurisdiction (P < 0.001) and were significantly lower among FAS participants (54.7 +/- 1.2) than among all other jurisdictions (P < 0.05). Total diet quality scores did not differ by food security status (59.9 +/- 0.8 food secure compared with 58.3 +/- 1.1 food insecure, P = 0.07); however, most diet quality adequacy component scores were significantly higher and moderation component scores significantly lower among participants in food secure households than those in food insecure households. Conclusion(s): Significant differences in children's diet quality and household food security existed across USAP jurisdictions.Copyright © 2023 American Society for Nutrition

N2  - Indigenous families tend to move house more often, especially families with young children. However, little is known about the impact of high mobility on children's well-being and development. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the relationship between residential mobility and children's health, developmental, and educational outcomes for Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand Indigenous children (0-12 years). Four databases were investigated with pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search identified 243 articles after independent screening by two authors. Eight studies assessing four child health outcomes were included, six quantitative and two qualitative. Child health outcomes were classified into four broad categories-physical health, social and emotional behavior, learning and development, and developmental risk. The review identified limited evidence; possible links were identified between high mobility and emotional and behavioral difficulties for younger children. One study identified evidence of a linear relationship between the number of houses a child has lived in since birth and developmental risk. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of high residential mobility for Indigenous children at different developmental stages. Prioritizing the involvement, collaboration, and empowerment of Indigenous communities and leadership is critical for future research.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

N2  - Quality education can build a sustainable, happier world, but what experiences support student well-being? Numerous laboratory studies suggest that prosocial behavior predicts greater psychological well-being. However, relatively little work has examined whether real-world prosociality programs are associated with greater well-being in primary school-aged children (aged 5-12). In Study 1, we surveyed 24/25 students who completed their 6th Grade curriculum in a long-term care home alongside residents called "Elders," which offered numerous opportunities for planned and spontaneous helping. We found that the meaning that students derived from their prosocial interactions with the Elders was strongly associated with greater psychological well-being. In Study 2, we conducted a pre-registered field experiment with 238 primary school-aged children randomly assigned to package essential items for children who experience homelessness and/or poverty who were either demographically similar or dissimilar in age and/or gender to them as part of a classroom outing. Children self-reported their happiness both pre- and post-intervention. While happiness increased from pre- to post-intervention, this change did not differ for children who helped a similar or dissimilar recipient. These studies offer real-world evidence consistent with the possibility that engaging in prosocial classroom activities-over an afternoon or year-is associated with greater psychological well-being in primary school-aged children.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

N2  - Background Child homelessness has been associated with elevated mental health problems during early adolescence, a period of onset for psychiatric problems. Prior literature has relied on cross-sectional studies, limiting the understanding of temporality and trajectories of psychopathology. We extend prior literature by examining associations between child homelessness and internalising and externalising symptom trajectories in early adolescence, with consideration of timing and persistence of homelessness. Methods Using population-based longitudinal data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we used multilevel models to examine the effects of homelessness prior to age 9, the timing of homelessness (eg, early vs middle childhood) and cumulative exposure to homelessness on internalising and externalising trajectories across ages <0-9 years. We also tested for sex differences in these associations. Results Of the 8391 participants, 5.5% reported exposure to homelessness at least once before age 9. Children who experienced homelessness had elevated internalising and externalising symptoms compared with their consistently housed peers, with excess risk evident among children who first experienced homelessness in middle childhood (relative to early childhood) and children who experienced recurrent homelessness. We did not observe changes in symptom trajectories over the course of 4 years. Men who experienced homelessness displayed a more pronounced risk of internalising symptoms relative to women and men who did not experience homelessness. Conclusion Childhood homelessness is associated with persistently elevated internalising and externalising symptoms across early adolescence compared with their consistently housed peers. Interventions and policies to address family homelessness may lead to better mental health among adolescents. Copyright © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: High quality child care positively affects long-term development in children and is a necessary support for parents who work or are in school. We assessed the association between child care setting and parents' report of difficulties with ability to work and/or further their education ("child care constraints") or material hardships among families with low incomes. Method(s): Cross-sectional data were analyzed from families in Minneapolis, MN with children aged six weeks to 48 months in child care from 2004 to 2017. Associations between child care setting (formal, informal relative, informal non-relative) and child care constraints or material hardships (household/child food insecurity, housing instability, energy instability) were examined. Result(s): Among 1580 families, 73.8% used informal care. Child care subsidy and public assistance program participation were higher among families utilizing formal care. Compared to formal care, families using informal relative or non-relative care had 2.44 and 4.18 greater adjusted odds of child care constraints, respectively. Families with children in informal non-relative care had 1.51 greater adjusted odds of household food insecurity. There were no statistically significant associations between informal relative care and household or child food insecurity, and no associations between child care setting and housing instability or energy insecurity. Conclusion(s): Informal care settings-relative and non-relative-were associated with child care constraints, and informal non-relative care with household food insecurity. Investment to expand equitable access to affordable, high-quality child care is necessary to enable parents to pursue desired employment and education and reduce food insecurity.Copyright © 2022 Academic Pediatric Association

N2  - Aim/Purpose To have a smooth and collaborative transition process from clinical trials to post-trial access programmes (PTA) at the patients' local hospitals. Methodology Initially we held discussions with sponsors to understand and plan timelines for patients to transition from clinical trials. Following this initial discussion, we identified the local hospitals of patients and initiated contact whilst ensuring all keys stake holders were involved. Firstly, we supported the local hospitals with the governance process for approval of PTA programmes. We then worked with the local hospitals delivering teaching and supporting with clinical and logistical procedures for prescribing and administering the unlicensed medication and setting up homecare. Contribution of CRF Professor Muntoni at Great Ormond Street Children's hospital is Chief Investigator for the Sarepta trials. The CRF nurses alongside the Research Transition Lead Nurse to initiate investigator meetings with the sites across the UK and acted as a lead point of call for Sarepta Therapeutics. This helped to understand the distribution of patients and their local hospital and enabled a co-ordinated approach to support a smooth and safe transition of patients to their local hospitals. Results &Conclusions We have successfully transitioned six patients to their local hospitals. A key conclusion is the benefit of working collaboratively as a UK to make sure that we planned a co-ordinated approach and local hospitals did not feel overwhelmed. A recommendation from our experience is to have early discussions with local hospitals when recruiting patients to clinical trials and plan for the possibility of compassionate use in principle.

N2  - Objective: This study examined the effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and emergency department use among homeless veterans receiving services in the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. Method(s): National VA administrative data from 2001 to 2017 were analyzed using propensity score matching to compare 1,524 homeless veterans who received ECT and 3,025 homeless veterans discharged from psychiatric inpatient units serving as matched controls. Result(s): Homeless veterans who received ECT were significantly less likely to have used any ED services 30 and 90 days after their first ECT session compared to homeless veterans who did not receive ECT (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.60-0.71; OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.81-0.93, respectively). Homeless veterans who received ECT showed reductions in suicidal ideation and suicide attempts after ECT, but these reductions were significantly less than homeless veterans who did not receive ECT 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year later (OR = 1.48-2.00). Conclusion(s): ECT has the potential to reduce ED use among homeless veterans with ECT-responsive psychiatric conditions. Further study is needed on whether the treatment engagement required of ECT participants indirectly reduces use of acute services in this population.© Copyright 2021 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

N2  - Background: Interventions targeting combined sexual and reproductive health, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) management and mental health care in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are few. There is a need to address common determinants of poor mental, psychosocial and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) through multimodal and multipronged interventions for adolescents. The main objective of this study was to identify whether and how interventions targeting adolescent SRHR and HIV with a focus on pregnant and parenting adolescents in SSA include mental health components and how these components and their outcomes have been reported in the literature. Method(s): We carried out a two process scoping review approach between 01.04.2021 and 23.08.2022. In the first stage, we searched the PubMed database to identify studies focusing on adolescents and young people aged 10 to 24 from 2001 to 2021. We identified studies focusing on HIV and SRHR that had mental health and psychosocial aspects to the interventions. Our search yielded 7025 studies. Of these 38 were eligible based on our screening criteria that covered interventions, and on further scrutiny, using PracticeWise, an established coding system, we identified select problems and practices to provide a more granular assessment of how interventions developed for this context mapped on to specific problems. At this second stage process, we selected 27 studies for inclusion as actual interventional designs for further systematic scoping of their findings and we used the Joanna Briggs Quality Appraisal checklist to rate these studies. This review was registered within the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), number CRD42021234627. Finding(s): Our first set of findings is that when coding problems and solutions, mental health concerns were the least common category of problems targeted in these SRHR/HIV interventions; nevertheless, psychoeducation and cognitive behavioral strategies such as improved communication, assertiveness training, and informational support were offered widely. Of the 27 interventional studies included in the final review, 17 RCTs, 7 open trials, and 3 mixed designs, represented nine countries of the 46 countries in SSA. Intervention types included peer, community, family, digital, and mixed modality interventions. Eight interventions focused on caregivers and youth. Social or community ecology associated problems (being an orphan, sexual abuse, homelessness, negative cultural norms) were the most common risk factors and were more frequent than medical issues associated with HIV exposure. Our findings highlight the relevance and centrality of social issues related to adolescent mental and physical health along with the need to strengthen multimodal interventions along the lines of problems we have identified in our review. Interpretation(s): Combined interventions jointly addressing adolescent SRHR, HIV, and mental health have been relatively understudied, despite evidence that adverse social and community factors are rampant in this population. Funding(s): MK was funded by Fogarty International Center K43 TW010716-05 and lead the initiative.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s)

N2  - Purpose: While young adults continue to shoulder a high burden of HIV and STIs, rates among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) are even higher. A deeper understanding of the correlates of STIs among this marginalized and underserved population is important to inform prevention and treatment strategies. Additionally, while we know that uptake of PrEP among YEH continues to be low despite high levels of risk, little is known about the knowledge, attitudes, and acceptance YEH have toward PrEP and factors that influence PrEP uptake. Method(s): We assessed the prevalence of HIV and STIs among a large sample of YEH in a highly populated urban metropolitan area in the south. We also assessed PrEP knowledge, attitudes, and acceptance. Baseline data from YEH participating in a randomized trial assessing the efficacy of a nurse-led HIV prevention intervention were used to assess for point-of-care testing results for HIV and STIs (Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, and Syphilis). Additionally, baseline survey data was used to examine population demographics, and PrEP knowledge and attitudes. A behavior score was summed from protective behaviors (condom use, STI testing, and taking PrEP) with a higher score indicating uptake of more protective behaviors. Result(s): Youth (N=361) averaged 21 years of age (sd = 2 y) with 60% identifying as Black/African American and 16% Hispanic. Participants' gender was diverse with the majority identifying as male (52%) and 6.4% of youth identifying as trans or nonbinary. Approximately 35% of the sample identified as LGBQ+. We found that 2.9% of youth tested positive for HIV (unconfirmed rapid test), among whom one participant indicated that this was a new diagnosis. Additionally, 6.2% of youth tested positive for Syphilis (unconfirmed rapid test), 4.9% positive for Gonorrhea, and 10% for Chlamydia. However, only 5.8% reported that they had been treated for STIs or HIV. Fisher's exact tests indicated that females were statistically more likely to test positive for Gonorrhea (p = 0.008) and Chlamydia (p = 0.032) but not Syphilis. While only 57% of youth had heard of PrEP, 46.2% indicated that they would be likely to take PrEP if it were free. Those who had a higher protective behavior score were statistically more likely to have heard of PrEP (p = 0.008). Conclusion(s): YEH continue to have high rates of HIV and STIs and yet few are receiving treatment when needed. While PrEP knowledge is low, it continues to increase, based on prior research. Despite the low level of PrEP knowledge, youth who become aware of PrEP appear to have a high level of interest, especially if it can be offered for free. Healthcare and social service providers should continue to discuss PrEP as prevention for YEH and find ways to support its uptake. Improvements are needed to increase the uptake of treatment for youth who test positive for STIs and increase awareness of gonorrhea and chlamydia among female YEH.

N2  - Background Persons with disability (PWD) experience disproportionately high poverty rates in Canada. This trend is apparent especially among youth compared to those who develop disabilities later in life. PWD in poverty have additional needs that increase barriers to full participation in society and translate to higher basic costs for daily living. Despite the existence of income assistance programs in Canada to mitigate income inequalities faced by PWDs, access to these programs can be limited. Objective To describe use of income assistance for young adults with disability in British Columbia for the development of potential approaches to improve realized access to these programs. Methods We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using British Columbia linked administrative data. We described differences in income assistance use among PWD by the level of special education funding received during primary school education (from most to least; Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Unfunded, and no special education) and family composition. We also provided longitudinal patterns of income assistance use. Results Of 218,324 young adults, 88% received no special education, 0.1% used Level One, 1.6% used Level Two, 2.9% used Level Three, and 7.1% used Unfunded special education coding. Young adults with Level One special education funding had the highest rates of hospitalizations and continuing care, with no hospitalization due to homelessness. Those with Level Three special education coding had higher rates of hospitalization and hospitalization due to, homelessness than Level Two young adults. When transitioning to adulthood initially, Level One and Two funded individuals used relatively more disability income assistance than individuals from the other funding levels. Nearly all BCEA users with higher funded special education codes used this disability-specific program, while lesser funded special education codes used the Temporary Assistance more frequently, for a longer duration and were more likely to be persistent Temporary Assistance users. Conclusions Sustainable and reliable access to income assistance programs remains an issue across the heterogeneity of needs faced by young adults with disability.Copyright © 2022 Scott et al.

N2  - Based on the broader concept of health proposed by the Pan-American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/ WHO), 2018, and the absence in the literature of indices that translate the causal relationship between sanitation and health, a methodology for assessing the health impact of a water and sanitation programmes, known as a Health Impact Assessment (HIA), was developed, specifically in the Brazilian context, and focused on a school in the northeast of the country. Through exploratory and descriptive evidence, and using documentary research as a method, a retrospective survey was carried out from 2000 to 2022 using documents proposing evaluation methodologies. A single document was found to fit the research objective, which was used to develop the proposed HIA methodology. Development of the methodology consisted of two stages: definition of the health dimensions and selection of the indicators making up each dimension. The HIA methodology was then applied to a school in northeast Brazil to test its use, before a water-efficient management intervention was going to be used. The overall score of 46% indicated that there was room for improvement, which the new management approach could facilitate. This methodology is therefore proposed to be an instrument for the evaluation of public water and sanitation policies, thus assisting managers in the decision-making process and in guiding sanitation programs and plans.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a widespread and devastating phenomenon resulting in a myriad of long-term consequences for survivors and their children. IPV victimization not only has negative health and economic consequences, it has also been linked to homelessness and housing instability. In response, the Domestic Violence Housing First (DVHF) model is being used in some domestic violence (DV) agencies to help survivors attain safe and stable housing. The model includes using individualized advocacy and/or flexible funding to help survivors meet these goals. Using a longitudinal, quasi-experimental design, the current study involved conducting interviews with survivors and examining agency records to investigate the effectiveness of this model. We hypothesized that survivors who received DVHF would experience less re-abuse and greater housing stability over 12months compared to those who received services as usual (SAU). The sample included 345 IPV survivors who had been homeless or unstably housed when they approached one of five DV programs for help. Interviews were spaced 6months apart (when survivors first sought services as well as 6months and 12months later). Longitudinal analyses showed that survivors who received the DVHF model reported greater improvements in housing stability at both the 6-month and 12-month time points compared to those receiving SAU. At the 12-month time point, survivors who had received DVHF reported decreased physical, psychological, and economic abuse, as well as the use of their children against them as a form of abuse. This study adds to a growing body of evidence supporting this model's effectiveness and adds to our understanding of factors impacting the long-term housing stability and safety for IPV survivors.

N2  - Importance: There have been no published randomized clinical trials with a primary outcome of socioeconomic inclusion for young people who have experienced homelessness. Objective(s): To explore whether young people exiting homelessness who received rent subsidies and adult mentorship experienced more socioeconomic inclusion relative to young people who received only rent subsidies. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This was a convergent mixed-methods, unblinded, 2-group, parallel randomized clinical trial with 1:1 allocation embedded within a community-based framework in 3 cities in Ontario, Canada. Participants were enrolled between March 1 and September 30, 2019, and were followed up through March 31, 2022. Intervention(s): Participants (n = 24) were randomly assigned adult mentors (n = 13) who had been recruited and screened by community partner agencies. All participants received portable rent subsidies (subsidy not tied to a specific location) for 2 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary quantitative outcomes were self-reported measures of community integration (psychological and physical) and self-esteem - proxy indicators of socioeconomic inclusion. Community integration was measured with the Community Integration Scale, with a score range of 1 to 7 for the physical component and 4 to 20 for the psychological component; higher scores indicate higher integration. Self-esteem was measured with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, with a score range of 0 to 30; higher scores indicate greater self-esteem. Secondary quantitative outcomes included social connectedness, hopelessness, and academic and vocational participation. All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. Result(s): A total of 24 youths (12 women [50.0%]; mean [SD] age, 21.8 [2.2] years [range, 18-26 years]; race and ethnicity: 10 White [41.7%], 8 Black [33.3%], 2 Asian [8.3%], 2 Indigenous [8.3%], and 2 different choice [8.3%]) transitioned out of homelessness and into market-rent housing. All youths in the group that received mentorship and in the group that did not receive mentorship had stable or nonsignificant improvements in all study outcomes at the primary end point of 18 months compared with baseline (mean [SD] Community Integration Scale psychological score: mentorship group, 11.3 [2.6] at baseline and 11.2 [3.9] at 18 months; no-mentorship group, 10.8 [4.1] at baseline and 13.2 [2.9] at 18 months; mean [SD] Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score: mentorship group, 16.0 [4.6] at baseline and 18.1 [5.2] at 18 months; no-mentorship group, 16.3 [6.1] at baseline and 19.6 [5.7] at 18 months). However, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the Community Integration Scale psychological score (adjusted mean difference, -2.0; 95% CI, -5.0 to 1.0; P =.18) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score (adjusted mean difference, -1.4; 95% CI, -5.0 to 2.3; P =.44) 18 months after randomization. Ancillary analysis suggested that youths with informal mentors (mentors outside the study) at baseline felt more psychologically integrated at 18 months relative to those with no informal mentors at baseline (adjusted mean difference, 3.6; 95% CI, 0.4-6.8; P =.03). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions made it challenging for mentors and mentees to connect, which may have affected the findings. Steady socioeconomic outcomes - potentially attributable to portable rent subsidies - are noteworthy, given the socioeconomic inequities this population has faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The possible benefit of informal mentorship warrants further investigation. This small pilot study was designed with the intention of generating data and hypotheses for a full-scale study; findings should be interpreted with caution.Copyright © 2022 JAMA Network Open.

N2  - Experiencing homelessness in infancy has been linked to negative physical and mental health outcomes. Parental well-being and the parent-infant relationship can also be negatively impacted by experiencing homelessness. While numerous parent-based infant mental health programs have been identified by a recent review, the goal of this study was to further determine the extent to which these existing programs were developed and/or examined with at-risk populations such as families experiencing homelessness. Out of 60 programs identified by Hare et al., in press, only three had been implemented specifically in shelter settings with infants 0-12 months (Parent-Infant Psychotherapy, New Beginnings, and My Baby's First Teacher). Additionally, when examining programs that began in later infancy (after 12 months), only 2 programs were implemented in shelter settings (Incredible Years and Parent-Child Interaction Therapy). Implications for research, policy, and clinicians regarding implementation of evidence-based prevention/treatment programs for parents and their infants experiencing homelessness are discussed.Copyright © 2023 Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with homelessnesss, and explore the relationship between homelessnesss and treatment outcomes among Black individuals. METHOD(S): This is a secondary analysis of the subgroup of Black participants (n = 73) enrolled in "X:BOT," a 24-week multisite randomized clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of extended-release naltrexone versus sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone (n = 570). Outcomes included medication initiation, return to extramedical use of opioids assessed by both self-report and urine toxicology, and engagement in medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) treatment at 28 weeks postrandomization. Descriptive statistics were performed. RESULT(S): Black participants were mostly unmarried and male, and about a third were aged 21-30 years. Among people experiencing homelessnesss, more were uninsured (45.5% [10/22] vs 19.6% [10/51]), unemployed (77.3% [17/22] vs 64.7% [33/51]), and reported alcohol (40.9% [9/22] vs 23.5% [12/51]) and sedative use (54.5% [12/22] vs 17.6% [9/51]) within the previous 30 days. Compared with housed Black individuals, a slightly higher proportion of Black individuals experiencing homelessnesss successfully initiated study medication (81.1% [18/22] vs 72.6% [37/51]); similar proportions returned to opioid use during the trial (68.2% [15/22] vs 68.6% [35/51]) and were engaged in MOUD at 28 weeks after trial entry (72.2% [13/18] vs 69.7% [23/33]) among participants located for follow-up. CONCLUSION(S): These descriptive results among Black patients participating in a trial of MOUD suggest that efficacious MOUD is possible despite homelessnesss with additional clinical supports such as those provided by a clinical trial.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Addiction Medicine.

N2  - Background: Persons experiencing homelessness face increased risk of influenza as overcrowding in congregate shelters can facilitate influenza virus spread. Data regarding on-site influenza testing and antiviral treatment within homeless shelters remain limited. Method(s): We conducted a cluster-randomized stepped-wedge trial of point-of-care molecular influenza testing coupled with antiviral treatment with baloxavir or oseltamivir in residents of 14 homeless shelters in Seattle, WA, USA. Residents >=3 months with cough or >=2 acute respiratory illness (ARI) symptoms and onset <7 days were eligible. In control periods, mid-nasal swabs were tested for influenza by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The intervention period included on-site rapid molecular influenza testing and antiviral treatment for influenza-positives if symptom onset was <48 h. The primary endpoint was monthly influenza virus infections in the control versus intervention periods. Influenza whole genome sequencing was performed to assess transmission and antiviral resistance. Result(s): During 11/15/2019-4/30/2020 and 11/2/2020-4/30/2021, 1283 ARI encounters from 668 participants were observed. Influenza virus was detected in 51 (4%) specimens using RT-PCR (A = 14; B = 37); 21 influenza virus infections were detected from 269 (8%) intervention-eligible encounters by rapid molecular testing and received antiviral treatment. Thirty-seven percent of ARI-participant encounters reported symptom onset < 48 h. The intervention had no effect on influenza virus transmission (adjusted relative risk 1.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-6.00). Of 23 influenza genomes, 86% of A(H1N1)pdm09 and 81% of B/Victoria sequences were closely related. Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest feasibility of influenza test-and-treat strategies in shelters. Additional studies would help discern an intervention effect during periods of increased influenza activity.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - Introduction: Some of the most noticeable children are those who live and work on the streets and in public places in cities all over the world. "Street children" are children who reside and labour on the streets. Aim of the Study: The study's objectives were to find out about the demographics and social problems of street children in Jaipur city, Rajasthan, and to describe them. Material(s) and Method(s): With a pre-made questionnaire and the respondent-driven sampling (RDS) method for the hard-to-reach population, an observational study was done on street children in Jaipur. Microsoft Excel and SPSS 23 were used to figure out the statistics. Result(s): Out of the 400 people who took part in the study, 91% were men and 9% were women. 84% were Hindus, 11% were Muslims, and 4.5% were Christians. About 58% had only gone to elementary school, followed by 25.3% for middle school and 3.5% for high school. About 46% left their home to get a job, followed by 84 (21%) because of domestic violence and 47 (11.8%) to get away from their parents' rules. 23 (5.8%) and 19 (4.8%) street children left their homes because their father or mother had died. Conclusion(s): Street children are the most vulnerable and hidden people, and no census ever counts them. With the help of non-government organisations (NGOs), an effort to train people for jobs and find them will change the situation in the future.Copyright © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

N2  - Introduction Despite the importance to address mental health issues as early as possible, youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) often lack prompt and easy access to health services. Recently, there has been a surge of studies focusing on leveraging technology to improve access to mental health services for YEH; however, limited efforts have been made to synthesise this literature, which can have important implications for the planning of mental health service delivery. Thus, this scoping review aims to map and synthesise research on the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to provide mental health services and interventions to YEH. Methods and analysis A scoping review of the literature will be conducted, following Arksey and O'Malley's proposed methodology, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews and recent guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute. All peer-reviewed papers using ICTs as a means of intervention will be considered, as well as grey literature. Only documents in English or French will be included in the analysis. First, 10 electronic databases will be consulted. Next, all data will be extracted into Covidence. Then, two reviewers will independently conduct the screening and data extraction process, in the case of discrepancies, a third reviewer will be included. Finally, data will be synthesised according to our objectives. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not required, as data will be collected from published literature. Findings will be disseminated through conference presentations and peer-reviewed journals.Copyright © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

N2  - Among young people who use drugs in the context of entrenched poverty and homelessness, pregnancy is often viewed as an event that can meaningfully change the trajectory of their lives. However, youth's desires and decision-making do not always align with the perspectives of various professionals and systems regarding how best to intervene during pregnancies and early parenting. Drawing on longitudinal interviews and fieldwork with young people in Vancouver, Canada, we explore how their romantic relationships powerfully shaped understandings of what was right and wrong and which actions to take during pregnancy and early parenting, and how these moral worlds frequently clashed with the imperatives of healthcare, criminal justice, and child protection systems. We demonstrate how a disjuncture between youth's desires, decision-making and moralities, and the systems that are intended to help them, can further entrench young people in cycles of loss, defeat, and harm. These cycles are powerfully racialized for young Indigenous people in our context.Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose: Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) uses long-chain referral whereby members of the target population recruit other members. We describe the use of RDS for a mixed-methods sexual and reproductive health (SRH) study in Kisumu, Kenya. Method(s): Initial seeds for the cross-sectional surveys were selected from adolescents aged 15-19 residing in urban informal settlements. Participants were provided up to five referral coupons to distribute. Result(s): Across four communities, 18 seeds were selected, 13,489 coupons distributed, and 3381 adolescents referred, yielding a 25% coupon return rate. We enrolled 3061 participants for a 23% survey rate. Median referral lag time was three days (IQR 1, 7). Demographic characteristics reached equilibrium between recruitment waves 5 to 8 in three communities, and waves 7 to 15 in the fourth. Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrated that RDS is a feasible and efficient approach for recruiting a large sample of adolescents. Though our research focused on SRH, many adolescents residing in the impoverished urban environments where our study was implemented also experience food insecurity, housing instability and violence. RDS can therefore be a valuable recruitment approach for future studies to reach vulnerable adolescents and design interventions that address the variety of health-related challenges that affect this underserved population.Copyright © 2022

N2  - Background. Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) cause respiratory illness in individuals of all ages. However, HPIV epidemiology data in people experiencing homelessness (PEH) are limited. Methods. We analyzed cross-sectional data from a clinical trial and SARS-CoV-2 surveillance study in 23 homeless shelters in King County, Washington from October 2019-May 2021. Questionnaires and nasal swab specimens were obtained from eligible participants at enrollment. Between October 2019-March 31, 2020, participants included those aged > 3 months with acute respiratory illness. Monthly shelter surveillance was also conducted where participants were recruited regardless of symptoms. With the community spread of SARS-CoV-2, the study design transitioned from a clinical trial to a SARS-CoV-2 surveillance study which expanded enrollment eligibility to include participants with or without symptoms from April 1, 2020, onward. Participants were not followed longitudinally but were permitted to enroll multiple times during the study period. Specimens were tested for HPIV 1-4 and other respiratory viruses using RT-PCR. Results. Among 14,464 specimens, 32 were HPIV-positive from 29 participants (median age 9 years, range 0.3-64 years; 45% female; 28% Black; 10% with chronic conditions) of which 59% were children. Family shelters had the highest percentage of HPIV infections (Table). HPIV was detected every month before the community spread of SARS-CoV-2. All HPIV-positive samples in May 2021 came from a single family shelter (Figure). Only 67% of HPIV-positive participants had symptoms with runny nose, cough and sore throat the most commonly reported. HPIV codetection with other respiratory viruses occurred in 19% of HPIV-positive specimens; Rhinovirus co-detection (16%) was the most common. Human Parainfluenza Encounters by Shelter Type Before and After April 1, 2020 Human Parainfluenza Positive Samples by Shelter Type Among Unique Participants Conclusion. HPIV affected PEH of all ages with most cases in shelters with children. Coinciding with community-wide SARS-CoV-2 mitigation efforts, the number of HPIV infections were reduced. However, a cluster of HPIV infections still occurred within one family shelter. Shelter-specific public health measures including nonpharmaceutical interventions used during the COVID-19 pandemic may reduce HPIV infections among residents.

N2  - Objective: To assess the prevalence and common causes of ocular pathology experienced by vulnerable women with marginalized housing and/or a history of abuse, violence, and trafficking. Method(s): Using a stratified random sampling technique, we recruited 93 women living in 10 randomly selected women's shelters in Toronto, Canada between May and November of 2018. All English-speaking females older than the age of 18 were eligible to participate. Data on demographics, medical or ocular history, subjective visual acuity, and access to eye care were obtained. Comprehensive visual screening and dilated fundoscopy were performed for each participant. Result(s): The median age was 40 years (interquartile range, 30.5-54 years) and the median duration of homelessness was 8 months (interquartile range, 2.25-20.5 months); 63.4% of participants reported a history of abuse, 44.9% experienced head trauma, 15.9% experienced eye trauma, 22.5% identified as refugees, and 2.17% (2 of 92) had been victims of human trafficking. The above variables were not significantly related to vision problem severity on univariate analysis. Based on the presenting visual acuity, 27.8% of participants (95% CI [18.9-38.2]) were found to have visual impairment. Visual impairment was mainly related to refractive error (54.8% [51 of 93]), however, nonrefractive pathology was also observed. Of all the participants, 64.5% had one or more abnormal findings during the vision screening, and 40.9% needed follow-up by an ophthalmologist. Most participants (96.7%) expressed interest in accessing free eye examinations. Conclusion(s): Visual impairment is highly prevalent among homeless women living in Toronto. Routine vision-screening programs present an opportunity to improve the ocular health of this vulnerable population.Copyright © 2022 Canadian Ophthalmological Society

N2  - Food insecurity has multiple negative effects on maternal and child health and nutritional outcomes. There is a dearth of up-to-date evidence on the prevalence of food insecurity in Bangladesh based on geographical variations. We investigated the prevalence of food insecurity based on geographical variations and its associated factors. We pooled data from seven cross-sectional surveys conducted in 15,009 households from March 2015 to May 2018. This study was a part of the evaluation of the Maternal Infant Young Child Nutrition Phase 2 programme implemented by BRAC, one of the largest international non-governmental organizations located in Bangladesh that covered rural areas in 26 districts and two urban slums in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We used Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (a widely used scale to measure household food insecurity) to estimate the food insecurity status from the data collected through a face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire. Hot spot analysis was conducted using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. The multiple logistic regression model was applied to explore the associated factors of food insecurity. The food insecurity hotspots were in the northwestern, central-southwestern, and coastal districts of Bangladesh. The overall prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe food insecurity were 12.7%, 13.8%, and 3.5%, respectively. In the adjusted model, household heads and caregivers of children with five or more years of schooling had respectively 42% (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.52, 0.64) and 46% (AOR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.61) less likelihood to suffer from food insecurity. Households in the middle (AOR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.65) and rich (AOR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.36) wealth status had lower odds of food insecurity. Food insecurity is widely spread in rural districts of Bangladesh and the degree of vulnerability is higher among the households of the northwestern, central-southwestern, and coastal areas of Bangladesh. Comprehensive interventions including strategies for poverty reduction and education for all might be effective to reduce food insecurity at rural households in Bangladesh.Copyright © 2023 Tariqujjaman et al.

N2  - Background: The experience of homelessness and child protection involvement pose risks to children's school success. Elucidating processes by which these interrelated systems affect child well-being is important for guiding policy and practice. Objective(s): This study examines the temporal relation between emergency shelter or transitional housing use and child protection involvement among school-aged children. We evaluated effects of both risk indicators on school attendance and school mobility. Participant and setting: Using integrated administrative data, we identified 3278 children (ages 4 to 15) whose families used emergency or transitional housing in Hennepin and Ramsey County of Minnesota during the 2014 and 2015 academic years. A propensity-score-matched comparison group of 2613 children who did not use emergency or transitional housing. Method(s): Through a series of logistic regressions and generalized estimating equations, we tested the temporal associations of emergency/transitional housing and child protection involvement as well as how both experiences affected school attendance and mobility. Result(s): Experiences of emergency or transitional housing often proceeded or occurred concurrently with child protection involvement and increased the likelihood of child protection services. Emergency or transitional housing and child protection involvement posed risks for lower school attendance and greater school mobility. Conclusion(s): A multisystem approach to assist families across social services may be important for stabilizing children's housing and bolstering their success at school. A two-generation approach focused on residential and school stability and enhancing family resources could boost adaptive success of family members across contexts.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Generalist health interventions that aim to reduce chronic health disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations can be culturally adapted to better meet the needs of Indigenous people in Canada; however, little is known regarding best practices in implementing these adaptations. The present study first provides a review of the research process used to adapt a previous evidence-based housing initiative for Indigenous youth in Northwestern Ontario. Second, it includes an overview of the adaptations that were made and the associated rationale for such adaptations. Third, it examines the experiences of participants and staff involved in the cultural adaptation of the Housing Outreach Program Collaborative (HOP-C), a health intervention re-designed to improve physical and mental health outcomes, wellbeing, and social support for formerly homeless Indigenous youth as they secure housing. Qualitative feedback from interviews with 15 participants and eight program staff, in addition to one focus group with an additional six frontline workers, described perceived outcomes of the program's cultural adaptations. Modifications to the overall program structure, specific roles within the program (including counseling services, peer mentorship, cultural services, and case management), and adaptations to general implementation within the health organization providing the intervention were described by participants and staff as effective and helpful adaptations. The focus of Indigenous values at an organizational level led to consistent adaptations in counseling and case management to best meet the unique needs of the youth involved. Based upon participant interviews, recommendations to future adaptations are provided.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

N2  - The current study examined heterogeneous trajectories of suicidal ideation among homeless youth experiencing suicidal ideation over 9 months in a randomized controlled intervention study. Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Youth reported their suicidal ideation four times during a 9-month period. We also assessed pretreatment mental health, demographic information and session attendance as predictors of the subgroups, as well as suicide-related factors as outcomes at the 9-month follow-up. Growth mixture models suggested three distinct trajectory groups among youth: Fast Declining (74.7%), Chronic (19.3%), and Steadily Declining (6.0%). Youth in the Chronic group used more substances at baseline than the Steadily Declining group, were more likely to be White, non-Hispanic than the Fast Declining group, and attended more CTSP sessions than other groups. Contrastingly, youth in the Steadily Declining group all experienced childhood abuse. Finally, youth in the Chronic group showed significant higher risk for future suicide compared to those in the Fast Declining group at 9 months. Findings support the heterogeneity of treatment responses in suicide intervention among homeless youth, with implications to improve treatment efforts in this very high-risk population.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To quantify the number and type of students failing to secure basic needs. PARTICIPANTS: Students attending 22 postsecondary schools in the United States in Fall 2019. METHOD(S): The Adult Food Security Module and part of the #RealCollege Survey were used to measure food and housing insecurity, respectively. Logistic and linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between selected factors and basic needs insecurities. RESULT(S): Participants (n=22,153) were classified as 44.1% and 52.3% food insecure and housing insecure, respectively. Homeless students or those who experienced childhood food insecurity were at the greatest odds of college food insecurity. Year in school was the largest contributor to being housing insecure, with PhD or EdD students being 1,157% more likely to experience housing insecurity compared to freshmen. CONCLUSION(S): High prevalence of basic needs insecurities remain. Current campus initiatives may be insufficient, calling for a more holistic approach at the campus, state, and national levels.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Multiple complex needs (MCN) describe a population experiencing a combination of homelessness, substance use, offending and/or mental ill-health. Using peer researchers, this study aimed to explore the perspectives of individuals with lived experience of MCN with regards to (i) issues leading to MCN and (ii) key intervention opportunities. METHOD(S): As part of a health needs assessment in Gateshead (North East England), trained peer researchers interviewed 27 adults (aged >=18 years) with experience of MCN, identified using purposive sampling methods. Peer researchers designed a topic guide for interviews which were audio recorded and thematically analyzed. RESULT(S): Interviewees reported adverse childhood experiences leading to MCN including abuse, bereavement, parental imprisonment, family break-up and inadequate support. Mental ill-health, substance use, poverty, early experiences of unstable housing and acute homelessness were identified as major precedents for adulthood experiences of MCN. Between 16 and 20 years, access to housing, social and mental health support was perceived as having the potential to prevent circumstances worsening. Individuals perceived removing barriers to mental health, housing and welfare and financial supports could help. CONCLUSION(S): This study highlights the perceived role austerity, adverse childhood events and current service provision have in current and future experiences of MCN. Individuals expressed a need for future interventions and support to be judgement free and provided by workers who are educated about MCN and related adversity. Involving peer researchers and individuals with experience of MCN in future research and service provision could ensure appropriate measures and supports are put in place.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - PURPOSE: To conduct a multi-dimensional and time-patterned analysis to identify distinct well-being trajectory profiles over a 6-year follow-up period among adults experiencing homelessness and mental illness. METHOD(S): Data from 543 participants of the At Home Chez Soi study's Toronto site were examined over a 6-year follow-up period, including measures of quality of life, community functioning, housing stability, and substance use. Well-being trajectories were identified using Group-Based Trajectory Modelling. Multinomial regression was used to identify predictor variables that were associated with each well-being trajectory profile. RESULT(S): Four well-being profiles were identified: low well-being, moderate well-being, good well-being, and high well-being. Factors associated with a greater likelihood of following a better well-being profile included receiving Housing First, reporting female gender and non-white ethnicity, having post-secondary studies, and reporting a high resilience level. Concurrently, factors associated with a lower likelihood of better well-being profiles were having a history of chronic homelessness, experiences of discrimination in the healthcare setting, having comorbid mental disorders and a high level of symptom severity, and reporting a history of traumatic brain injury and childhood adversity. CONCLUSION(S): Individuals experiencing homelessness follow distinct well-being profiles associated with their socio-demographic characteristics, health status, trauma history, resilience capabilities, and access to housing and support services. This work can inform integrated housing and support services to enhance the well-being trajectories of individuals experiencing homelessness.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of wearable technologies in physical activity assessment in three paediatric diseases, namely, Niemann-Pick C (NP-C), Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). DESIGN: Exploratory study SETTING AND PATIENTS: Thirty children were recruited across three UK hospitals (Royal Manchester's Children Hospital, Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, and the Great North Children's Hospital). Ten were diagnosed with NP-C, eight with DMD and twelve with JIA. INTERVENTION: All participants completed the 6-min walk test (6MWT) at enrolment. Patients were provided with disease-specific smartphone apps paired with a wearable device via Bluetooth. Ambulation was recorded in 30-min epochs measuring average daily maximum (ADM), average daily steps (ADS) and average daily steps per 30-min epoch (ASE). RESULT(S): Median 6MWT results were 450 m, 325 m and 434.5 m for the NP-C, DMD and JIA cohorts, respectively. Wearable data capture was feasible in all three disease cohorts, although complete data capture was not sustained. A statistically significant between-cohort difference was identified for ADM, ADS and ASE. Statistically significant differences were found between DMD/JIA for ADM; NP-C/DMD for ADS and DMD/JIA for ASE. DISCUSSION: Wearable sensor technologies have the potential to provide additional information for our understanding of ambulation in chronic paediatric disease. The wearable devices were easy to use and popular with patients although key features need to be addressed to appropriately meet study objectives. As the technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, opportunities to implement child friendly solutions are already available.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Healthcare systems are increasingly interested in identifying patients' housing-related risks, but minimal information exists to inform screening question selection. The primary study aim is to evaluate discordance among 5 housing-related screening questions used in health care. METHOD(S): This was a cross-sectional multisite survey of social risks used in a convenience sample of adults seeking care for themselves or their child at 7 primary care clinics and 4 emergency departments across 9 states (2018-2019). Housing-related risks were measured using 2 questions from the Accountable Health Communities screening tool (current/anticipated housing instability, current housing quality problems) and 3 from the Children's HealthWatch recommended housing instability screening measures (prior 12-month: rent/mortgage strain, number of moves, current/recent homelessness). The 2-sided Fisher's exact tests analyzed housing-related risks and participant characteristics; logistic regression explored associations with reported health (2019-2020). RESULT(S): Of 835 participants, 52% screened positive for >=1 housing-related risk (n=430). Comparing the tools, 32.8% (n=274) screened discordant: 11.9% (n=99) screened positive by Children's HealthWatch questions but negative by Accountable Health Communities, and 21.0% (n=175) screened positive by the Accountable Health Communities tool but negative by Children's HealthWatch (p<0.001). Worse health was associated with screening positive for current/anticipated housing instability (AOR=0.56, 95% CI=0.32, 0.96) or current/recent homelessness (AOR=0.57, 95% CI=0.34, 0.96). CONCLUSION(S): The 5 housing questions captured different housing-related risks, contributed to different health consequences, and were relevant to different subpopulations. Before implementing housing-related screening initiatives, health systems should understand how specific measures surface distinct housing-related barriers. Measure selection should depend on program goals and intervention resources.Copyright © 2021 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - There is growing evidence that diversion to a mental health court program (MHC) can reduce recidivism rates and improve the quality of life of clients. However, there is less known about MHC client characteristics and factors associated with recidivism. Yet, this information would be useful to increase the effectiveness of these programs. Cross-sectional quantitative data were collected on MHC clients in three consecutive years. Of the 155 program clients that were successfully interviewed, only 154 were included in the analysis due to one non-consent to collect further data from their case manager. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to examine "What individual factors are associated with recidivism among MHC program clients?" This analysis specifically explored the association of sex, age, low functional ability, homelessness, court site, and criminal history. From the multiple logistic regression results, the increased risk of recidivism was found to be significantly associated with younger clients and a prior criminal history. The results of this study suggest programs tailored to young adults and repeat offenders may be areas that MHCs could potentially focus on to increase their effectiveness.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review is to explore existing literature on primary care services for adult and adolescent homeless, map the evidence and identify gaps in the literature. INTRODUCTION: Homeless adults and adolescents have complicated health needs, increased need for services, and more barriers to care. Recipients of primary care services use less emergency and urgent care resources. More information is needed in order to tailor primary care services for this vulnerable population. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review will consider studies with participants aged 13 years or older who are currently or previously homeless. Studies will be included regardless of type of primary care service, country of origin, healthcare delivery system, geographic location or cultural setting. METHOD(S): The proposed scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the JBI methodology for scoping reviews. The search strategy aims to locate published and unpublished studies. The search strategy will be adapted for each information source. The reference lists of selected studies will be screened for additional citations. The search will be limited to the English language, but not by date of publication. Databases to be searched, include MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, Scopus, Embase, PsycINFO, PsychArticles, PsycEXTRA, Academic Search Premier and Web of Science. Gray literature and unpublished studies will be searched. After screening titles and abstracts, two independent reviewers will retrieve potentially relevant, full-text studies and extract data. Data will be presented in diagrammatic form, accompanied by a narrative summary.

N2  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has drastically altered all facets of clinical care and research. Clinical research in hepatology has had a rich tradition in several domains, including the discovery and therapeutic development for diseases such as hepatitis B and C, and studying the natural history of many forms of chronic liver disease. NIH, foundation and industry funding has provided important opportunities to advance the academic careers of young investigators while they strived to make contributions to the field. Instantaneously, however, all non-essential research activities were halted when the pandemic started, forcing those involved in clinical research to re-think their research strategy, including a shift to COVID-19 research while endeavoring to maintain their pre-existing agenda. Strategies to maintain the integrity of ongoing studies, including patient follow up, safety assessments and continuation of investigation products, have included a shift to telemedicine, remote safety laboratory monitoring, and shipping of investigational products to study subjects. As a re-vamp of research is being planned, unique issues that face the research community include maintenance of infrastructure, funding, completion of studies in the pre-determined time frame and the need to re-program career path timelines. Real world databases, biomarker and long term follow up studies, and research involving special groups (children, the homeless and other marginalized populations) are likely to face unique challenges. The implementation of telemedicine has been dramatically accelerated and will serve as a backbone for the future of clinical research. As we move forward, innovation in clinical trial design will be essential for conducting optimized clinical research.Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess relationships between material hardships, shortened sleep duration, and suboptimal sleep practices across infancy and toddlerhood in low-income Hispanic families. METHOD(S): We analyzed longitudinal data of 451 low-income Hispanic mother-child pairs from a child obesity prevention trial. During infancy and toddlerhood, we used adjusted linear regression to assess associations between material hardship (financial difficulty, food insecurity, housing disrepair, multiple hardships), sleep duration (24-hour, night), and the number of suboptimal sleep practices (e.g., later bedtime, co-sleeping). We used adjusted linear regression to assess the longitudinal association between the number of suboptimal sleep practices in infancy and toddlerhood, and tested whether specific or multiple hardships moderated this association. RESULT(S): In infants, financial difficulty and multiple hardships were associated with decreased night sleep (B=-0.59 hours, 95% CI: -1.04, -0.14; and B=-0.54 hours, 95% CI: -1.00, -0.08). Housing disrepair was associated with decreased 24-hour sleep (B=-0.64 hours, 95% CI: -1.29, -0.01). In toddlers, each additional suboptimal sleep practice was associated with a decrease in night sleep (B=-0.19 hours, 95% CI: -0.29, -0.09). Each additional suboptimal sleep practice in infancy was associated with a 0.30 increase in the number of suboptimal sleep practices in toddlerhood (p<0.001), with greater increases for those with food insecurity or multiple hardships. CONCLUSION(S): Specific and multiple hardships shortened sleep duration during infancy, and moderated the increase of suboptimal sleep behaviors between infancy and toddlerhood. Future studies should consider these early critically sensitive periods for interventions to mitigate material hardships and establish healthy sleep practices.Copyright © 2020.

N2  - My Baby's First Teacher is an intervention designed specifically for parents with infants staying in emergency homeless shelters. Infants are overrepresented in shelter populations and face considerable risk to their development, including mental health. We utilized a randomized controlled design across three family shelters to evaluate the program's effectiveness with 24 dyads assigned to the intervention compared to 21 dyads in care-as-usual. Dyads were randomized by round at each site to account for shelter effects. We used path analysis to illustrate change over time and in relation to intervention assignment.Copyright © 2020 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We examined associations between household food insecurity status and parental feeding behavior, weight perception, and child weight status in a diverse sample of young children. METHOD(S): Cross-sectional analysis of 2-year old children in Greenlight, a cluster randomized trial to prevent childhood obesity. The exposure was food insecurity, defined as a positive response to a validated screen. Outcomes were parent feeding behaviors/beliefs measured by the Child Feeding Questionnaire and child weight status. T-tests and linear regression were used to assess associations between food insecurity and each outcome. We adjusted for child sex, race/ethnicity, parent education, employment, site, number of children in the home, and WIC status. RESULT(S): 503 households (37%) were food insecure. After adjusting for covariates, parents from insecure households reported more pressuring feeding behaviors (mean factor score 3.2 compared to food secure parents mean factor score 2.9, p=0.01) and were more worried about their child becoming overweight (mean factor score 2.3 vs 2.0; p=0.02). No differences were observed in monitoring or restrictive feeding behaviors. After adjusting for covariates, there was no difference in weight status or prevalence of overweight/obesity of children or parents based on household food insecurity status. CONCLUSION(S): Parents from food insecure households reported more pressuring feeding behaviors. This finding underscores the need to address food insecurity and potentially prevent harmful effects on child feeding. Parents in food insecure households might benefit from linkage with resources and education to develop healthier feeding behaviors.Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The burden of food insecurity is large in Sub-Saharan Africa, yet the evidence-base on the relation between household food insecurity and early child development is extremely limited. Furthermore, available research mostly relies on cross-sectional data, limiting the quality of existing evidence. We use longitudinal data on preschool-aged children and their households in Ghana to investigate how being in a food insecure household was associated with early child development outcomes across three years. Household food insecurity was measured over three years using the Household Hunger Score. Households were first classified as "ever food insecure" if they were food insecure at any round. We also assessed persistence of household food insecurity by classifying households into three categories: (i) never food insecure; (ii) transitory food insecurity, if the household was food insecure only in one wave; and (iii) persistent food insecurity, if the household was food insecure in two or all waves. Child development was assessed across literacy, numeracy, social-emotional, short-term memory, and self-regulation domains. Controlling for baseline values of each respective outcome and child and household characteristics, children from ever food insecure households had lower literacy, numeracy and short-term memory. When we distinguished between transitory and persistent food insecurity, transitory spells of food insecurity predicted decreased numeracy (beta = -0.176, 95% CI: -0.317; -0.035), short-term memory (beta = -0.237, 95% CI: -0.382; -0.092), and self-regulation (beta = -0.154, 95% CI: -0.326; 0.017) compared with children from never food insecure households. By contrast, children residing in persistently food insecure households had lower literacy scores (beta = -0.243, 95% CI: -0.496; 0.009). No gender differences were detected. Results were broadly robust to the inclusion of additional controls. This novel evidence from a Sub-Saharan African country highlights the need for multi-sectoral approaches including social protection and nutrition to support early child development.

N2  - Homeless young adults are more likely than their never-homeless counterparts to abuse substances and engage in sexual risk behaviors. This study evaluated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of OnTrack, a smartphone application to self-monitor substance use and sexual risk behaviors, plus a brief motivational intervention (BMI), in reducing substance use and sexual risk among homeless young adults. A randomized controlled pilot trial (N = 60) compared OnTrack + BMI to treatment as usual (TAU) at an inner-city crisis shelter for homeless young adults (aged 18-21 years). Participants were assessed at baseline and 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks after baseline to evaluate substance use and sexual risk behaviors. Kruskal-Wallis tests determined differences between baseline and postintervention assessments. Logistic regression models examined treatment effect on change in outcomes between baseline and postintervention follow-up assessment, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in OnTrack + BMI significantly reduced past 2-week number of drinks (p = .023), times used marijuana (p = .046), times engaged in unprotected sex (p = .012), and times used drugs before sexual activity (p = .019). No reductions of substance use or sexual risk behaviors were found among participants in TAU (all ps > .05). After adjusting for baseline levels of substance use and sexual risk, participants in OnTrack + BMI had significantly lower odds than those in TAU for drinking alcohol (adjusted OR = 0.14; p = .01) and having unprotected sex (adjusted OR = 0.151; p = .032). OnTrack + BMI is feasible and effective in reducing past 2-week alcohol use and unprotected sex among homeless young adults. A larger randomized trial is warranted to replicate and extend present results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

N2  - Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection, causing significant morbidity and economic burden. Strategies like national screening programs or home-testing kits were introduced in some developed countries, yet their effectiveness remains controversial. In this systematic review, we examined reviews of chlamydia screening interventions to assess their effectiveness and the elements that contribute to their success to guide public policy and future research. We assessed English material published after 2000 in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, the British Nursing Index, Medical Database, and Sociological Abstracts, in addition to World Health Organization Global Health Sector Strategies, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control guidelines, and the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. Systematic reviews that focused on chlamydia screening interventions were included. Using the socioecological model, we examined the levels of interventions that may affect the uptake of chlamydia screening. A total of 19 systematic reviews were included. Self-collection in home-testing kits significantly increased screening among girls and women 14-50 years of age. At the organizational level, using electronic health records and not creating additional costs facilitated testing. At the community level, outreach interventions in community and parent centers and homeless shelters achieved high screening rates. At the policy level, interventions with educational and advisory elements could result in significant improvements in screening rates. Copyright © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Young adults experiencing homelessness are at increased risk for sexual assault. Receiving a post-sexual assault examination has important implications for HIV and unintended pregnancy prevention; yet, utilization is not well understood. In a population at elevated risk for HIV, unintended pregnancy, and sexual violence, identifying barriers and facilitators to post-sexual assault examination is imperative. METHOD(S): As part of a large, multisite study to assess youth experiencing homelessness across 7 cities in the U.S, a cross-sectional survey was conducted between June 2016 and July 2017. Data were analyzed in 2019 to determine the prevalence and correlates of sexual violence and examine the correlates of post-sexual assault examination utilization. RESULT(S): Respondents (n=1,405), aged 18-26 years, were mainly youth of color (38% black, 17% Latinx) and identified as cisgender male (59%) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer (29%). HIV risks were high: 23% of participants had engaged in trade sex, 32% had experienced sexual assault as a minor, and 39% had experienced sexual exploitation. Young adults reported high rates of sexual assault (22%) and forced sex (24%). Yet, only 29% of participants who were forced to have sex received a post-sexual assault examination. Latinx young adults were more likely than other races/ethnicities to receive post-assault care. Participants frequently said they did not get a post-sexual assault exam because they did not want to involve the legal system and did not think it was important. CONCLUSION(S): Interventions are needed to increase use of preventive care after experiencing sexual assault among young adults experiencing homelessness.Copyright © 2019 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

N2  - Psychosocial risk exposure in childhood is associated with a greater probability of emotional, behavioral, and academic problems. It is not surprising that children who experience homelessness, a marker of high cumulative risk, show significant emotional and behavioral problems and lower academic achievement than other children, including impoverished children who are not homeless. Nonetheless, some children manifest positive adjustment despite the hazards associated with homelessness, and it is important to identify protective influences that might be targeted for intervention. One potential factor is mastery motivation (MM), or the drive to control and master challenges, theoretically associated with resilience and empirically linked to adaptive cognitive outcomes in low-risk children. Currently, there is little research on MM in high-risk young children overall, and data are particularly limited on the key question of whether MM is associated with better outcomes in domains crucial for school readiness, including socioemotional adjustment, self-regulation, and academic competence. This study examined observed MM in 85 young children ages 3 to 5 living with their parents in an emergency shelter. Children completed behavioral tasks to assess MM, and measures linked with school readiness were assessed directly or by parent report. Higher MM was associated with better social and emotional functioning and emotion regulation but not math achievement or executive functioning. Follow-up analyses indicated that MM was indirectly associated with prosocial behavior through better emotion-regulation abilities. Implications are discussed for further research and for interventions designed to address educational disparities and promote school success for children experiencing homelessness.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between housing instability and poor diet quality in a sample of urban parents and children. METHOD(S): Cross-sectional study of 340 parent/guardian-child dyads visiting a pediatric primary care center in Boston, Massachusetts. The parent/guardian (hereafter, parent) completed two Harvard Service Food Frequency Questionnaires, one regarding their own dietary intake and one regarding their child's intake, and an assessment of health-related social needs. Diet quality was measured using the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010; score range 0-100). Housing instability was defined as: (1) homeless or in sheltered housing, (2) doubled up with another family, (3) utilities threatened or shut off, or (4) concerned about eviction. Multivariable logistic regression was used to measure associations between unstable housing and lowest-quartile HEI-2010 scores, adjusting for parent age, race/ethnicity, education, income, and child age. RESULT(S): Median (interquartile range) parent and child HEI-2010 scores were 63.8 (56.3-70.8) and 59.0 (54.2-64.7), respectively. Housing instability was found in 136 dyads (40%). In multivariable analysis, it was associated with increased odds of lowest-quartile total parent HEI-2010 scores (aOR 1.9 [95% CI 1.1-3.5]) but not child scores (aOR 1.4 [95% CI 0.8-2.5]). It was also associated with increased odds of lowest-quartile parent HEI-2010 dietary component scores for Total vegetables and Greens and beans (aOR 2.0 [95% CI 1.1-3.7] and aOR 2.5 [95% CI 1.3-4.8], respectively). CONCLUSION(S): In this urban primary care population, housing instability is associated with lower diet quality scores for parents but not children. Lower vegetable consumption appears to drive this association.Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: The phenomenon of street children is one of the most important concerns facing global community. Identifying risk factors in such children could lead to crucial investigations to find their essential needs by intervention programs. The present study examined the family profile of street children in Tehran, Iran. Method(s): The sample consisted of 584 street children who were evaluated by 15 examiners. Using multi-stage sampling, twenty-seven different areas of Tehran were divided into 5 clusters and the children were selected randomly from each cluster. The two questionnaires applied included a demographic questionnaire and a questionnaire about high-risk behaviors such as substance use, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, etc. Result(s): There was a statistical significant association between the length of work time and two variables: sex and economic status of family (p < 0.05). Incarceration history of street children who had lost both their parents and their parents had been divorced was significantly higher than others (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): The street children's lifestyle is a risk factor for affecting them to variety types of socio-mental problems. Statistical significant association between parental divorces or the loss of both parents with a history of conviction mentions the important role of parents in transmitting moral and social values to children.Copyright © 2014, Brieflands.

T1  - Eclipse period of R1 plasmids during downshift from elevated copy number: Nonrandom selection of copies for replication

A1  - Dasgupta S. 
N2  - The classical Meselson-Stahl density-shift method was used to study replication of pOU71, a runaway-replication derivative of plasmid R1 in Escherichia coli. The miniplasmid maintained the normal low copy number of R1 during steady growth at 30 degreeC, but as growth temperatures were raised above 34 degreeC, the copy number of the plasmid increased to higher levels, and at 42 degreeC, it replicated without control in a runaway replication mode with lethal consequences for the host. The eclipse periods (minimum time between successive replication of the same DNA) of the plasmid shortened with rising copy numbers at increasing growth temperatures (). In this work, eclipse periods were measured during downshifts in copy number of pOU71 after it had replicated at 39 and 42 degreeC, resulting in 7- and 50-fold higher than normal plasmid copy number per cell, respectively. Eclipse periods for plasmid replication, measured during copy number downshift, suggested that plasmid R1, normally selected randomly for replication, showed a bias such that a newly replicated DNA had a higher probability of replication compared to the bulk of the R1 population. However, even the unexpected nonrandom replication followed the copy number kinetics such that every generation, the plasmids underwent the normal inherited number of replication, n, independent of the actual number of plasmid copies in a newborn cell. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: There has been a rise in food insecurity in Europe since the 2008 global financial crisis and households with children are particularly vulnerable. We aimed to explore families' experiences of food insecurity and how these experiences affect children's nutritional health and wellbeing. Method(s): In this systematic review and meta-ethnography, we searched Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, and ASSIA from Jan 1, 2008, to July 10, 2021, supplemented by grey literature, reference lists, and citation searches. Screening was done in duplicate to ensure consistent application of inclusion criteria and minimise random errors. Following title and abstract screening, full texts were screened against the inclusion criteria (qualitative research focussing on children's nutritional health and wellbeing, with data from 2008 onwards, from high-income European countries). Data extracted included study design, country of origin, caregiver type, gender, age, ethnic group, migration status, accommodation type, measure of food insecurity and other socioeconomic factors. Data were synthesised according to Noblit & Hare's seven phases of meta-ethnography. Our protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020214159). Finding(s): We identified 11 589 unique records; 19 were included, involving 813 participants. We identified four key themes: food and eating practices, awareness, fragility, and networks of care. Within the key themes, we identified five subthemes: diet, compromised infant feeding practices, psychological fragility, social fragility, and physical fragility. We found that children with food insecurity were aware of their family's scarce resources, with most active in trying to help their family while also forming their own networks of care. We found that food insecurity adversely affects children's physical, psychological, and social experiences setting them on a trajectory towards sub-optimal health. Interpretation(s): Children's nutritional health and wellbeing is adversely affected by food insecurity. This meta-ethnography highlights gaps in our knowledge about children's nutritional health relating to a range of sociodemographic factors. There is a need to actively involve children in more research and policy. A strength and limitation of this review is the diverse range of included studies from different European contexts, in which contextual factors could have affected our findings.

N2  - Background Being-street mother is a challenging life situation for both the mothers and their children. However, the lived experiences of motherhood in street families are not explored very well in Ethiopia in general. Hence, this study explored street mothers' well-being, perception of street life, and motivation to leave street life in Bahir Dar city, Ethiopia. Methods A phenomenological study was conducted on 10 street mothers from July 13, 2021 to July 17, 2021. The mothers were selected using purposive sampling technique. Data were collected using face-to-face in-depth interview method. Data were analyzed using framework approach. Results Four themes emerged from the data: well-being of mothers and their children with four subthemes (physical, social, mental, and spiritual wellbeing), perception of street life, motivations to leave street life and efforts to end street life. Nearly all of the street mothers perceived that living on the street was terrible for them and their kids. They described it as an absolutely revolting, bitter, awful, horrible, and difficult life. Generally, street mothers had the motivation to leave street life, but only some had exerted tangible efforts to end the street life. Conclusion Street mothers had a very poor status in almost all dimensions of well-being. The perception of mother about their street life was negative. The mothers had strong motivation to end street life but were unable to make strong tangible efforts showing that they need assistance mechanisms before they change to street extended families under misery.

N2  - Background: Mothers from low-income households experience higher rates of food insecurity and household chaos, which may lead to suboptimal infant feeding and risk of obesity. This study examined associations between household factors and infant feeding practices among low-income mothers during early infancy. Method(s): This secondary data analysis includes 218 mother-infant dyads from the WEE Baby Care study, a pragmatic randomized clinical trial testing a patient-centered responsive parenting intervention vs. standard care on infant growth. Mothers reported infant feeding practices (Infant Feeding Styles Questionnaire, 13 subscales), food insecurity (2-items) at infant age 6 months, and household chaos (Confusion, Hubbub and Order Scale, 15-items) at infant age 2 months. General linear models examined the effect of food insecurity and household chaos on infant feeding practices, adjusting for maternal age and study group. Result(s): Twenty-eight percent of mothers reported food insecurity and the mean household chaos score was 25.7 +/- 5.4 (possible range from 15 to 60, with higher scores representing a more chaotic home environment). There were no higher-order interactions between household chaos and food insecurity on feeding practices. Main effects revealed that mothers who reported higher household chaos used more pressure to soothe (B=0.03, SE=0.01, p=0.02) and laissezfaire bottle feeding practices (B=0.02, SE=0.01, p=0.03). Food insecure households also used more pressure to soothe (B=0.27, SE=0.13, p=0.04). There were no other significant associations between household factors and feeding practices. Conclusion(s): When examining feeding practices in low-income households, it is important to consider and evaluate household chaos and food security in a social-ecological framework.

N2  - Extending research on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), this study aimed to investigate whether the prevalence of and outcomes associated with adverse adult experiences vary among racial and ethnic subgroups. Survey data were collected from 1566 low-income women in Wisconsin using the Adult Experiences Survey (AES). Ten major adult adversities were assessed, including items that reference an intimate partner or household member (e.g., physical or emotional abuse, substance use) along with other social and economic stressors such as homelessness and discrimination. Adverse adult experiences were highly prevalent overall, but even more so among non-Hispanic Whites than their Black and Hispanic counterparts. The results reinforce prior research on ACEs in low-income populations. Lending further credence to these findings, tests of measurement invariance indicated that the AES demonstrated acceptable configural and scalar invariance across racial and ethnic groups. As expected, greater exposure to adult adversity was significantly related to poorer physical and mental health. These associations manifested cross-sectionally and longitudinally for observed and latent measures of adult adversity-even after controlling for ACEs. Associations between adult adversity and health were not moderated by race/ethnicity. In sum, adverse adult experiences were unequally distributed across racial/ethnic groups, but the consequences associated with adversity appeared to be evenly dispersed.Copyright © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

T1  - MAPPING MOBILE HEALTH CLINICS IN CANADA: DELIVERING EQUITABLE PRIMARY CARE TO CHILDREN AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS

N2  - BACKGROUND: Low-income and racially diverse populations often have multiple barriers in accessing healthcare and are at increased risk of poor health outcomes. COVID-19 exacerbated these health inequities: decreased in-person appointments, difficult access to virtual care and deprioritization of elective clinical activity led to delays in well-child visits and vaccination. This public health emergency highlighted a need to develop alternative models to enable access to primary care for vulnerable children. While mobile clinics are well-established in the United States, little is known about them in Canada. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aims to characterize Canadian mobile clinics providing primary care health services to vulnerable populations, including children, and seeks to inform the implementation of a pediatric mobile clinic under development. DESIGN/METHODS: This environmental scan screened scientific databases and the grey literature using a combination of terms designating mobile health clinics and Canadian locations. Relevant Canadian primary care mobile clinic initiatives were subsequently included. We defined primary care mobile clinics as movable health care units providing primary healthcare services delivered by general medical practitioners (pediatricians and family physicians). Examples of excluded initiatives were mobile clinics focused on education/literacy, dental care, vision care, endocrinology, cancer screening, safe injection sites, vaccination, physical rehabilitation and urgent care. Descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis were performed. RESULT(S): 29 clinics were identified, of which 26 are still active. Most clinics were located in Ontario (n=11), followed by British Columbia (n=8), Alberta (n=5), Quebec (n=2) and the Maritimes (n=2). The first mobile clinic in Canada was launched in 1996, with an increasing number of new clinics in 2021. While all clinics served vulnerable populations, some targeted specific groups, such as children, people experiencing homelessness, immigrants, LGBTQ+ individuals and Indigenous peoples. We identified three pediatric mobile clinics, two of which targeted teenagers. Onboard the clinics, physicians often worked with nurses, outreach workers and social workers. These professionals provided primary care services, as well as healthcare navigation, sexual education, mental health care, harm reduction supplies, vaccination and emergency care. All mobile clinics partnered with their local government, charities or businesses to fund their initiative. CONCLUSION(S): Mobile health clinics are a growing model of primary care in Canada. They are the result of a multidisciplinary collaboration between healthcare providers, social workers and outreach workers. To this date, Canadian pediatric mobile clinics remain a handful and represent an interesting avenue to address health inequities in children, during the pandemic and beyond.

N2  - Introduction: Poor academic performance has been linked to factors such as sleep, health, illicit drug use, physical fighting, social media use, cyber bullying, physical activity, homelessness, times spent in video games and television. It is difficult to get a sense of the interplay between and relative importance of different behaviours/ factors on academic performance as only limited research has been aimed at quantifying these factors. Objective(s): To evaluate association of school performance and variables in five categories of the YRBSS: physical fighting, diet/ lifestyle, electronic device usage, concurrent substance use, and violence/self-harm. Method(s): The CDC Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) data from 1991-2019 was used in study. Respondents were grouped by good and poor school performance and variables related to nutrition/lifestyle, electronic device use, concurrent substance use, mood/violence/self-harm were analyzed using chisquare test. Result(s): A total of 41,235 student respondents.Nutrition/Lifestyle, electronic device use, concurrent substance use, mood/violence/ self-harm are found to be significantly correlated with school performance. Conclusion(s): In national data, we found school performance is affected by nutrition, lifestyle, substance use, mood and exposure to surrounding violence, and self-harm. Further studies should be planned to evaluate benefits from the risk stratification to reduce this burden amongst US adolescents. (Figure Presented).

N2  - This study investigated caregiving responsibilities and associated mental health outcomes in young adult carers during the COVID-19 pandemic and had three aims: (1) to investigate differences in caregiving responsibilities across two groups of young adult carers (parental illness context vs. ill non-parent family member context) relative to non-carers, (2) to identify COVID-19/lockdown correlates of caregiving responsibilities, and (3) to examine the longitudinal associations between caregiving responsibilities and mental health outcomes. Of the 1048 Italians aged 18-29 (Mage = 24.48, SDage = 2.80; 74.33% female) who consented to complete online surveys at Time 1, 813 reported no ill family member (non-carers). Young adult carers included 162 with an ill parent and 73 with an ill non-parent family member. The study included 3 time points: 740 participants completed Time 2 assessment (Mage = 24.35, SDage = 2.81; 76.76% female), while 279 completed Time 3 assessment (Mage = 24.78, SDage = 2.72; 79.93% female). Key variables measured were 13 COVID-19/lockdown factors at Times 1 and 2, caregiving responsibilities at Time 2, and mental health outcomes at Time 3 (fear of COVID-19, anxiety, depression, wellbeing). Two COVID-19/lockdown factors were significantly correlated with higher caregiving responsibilities: insufficient home space, and greater time spent working and learning from home. As predicted, young adult carers reported higher caregiving responsibilities than non-carers, and this effect was greater in young adults caring for an ill parent compared to young adults caring for an ill non-parent family member. As expected, irrespective of family health status, caregiving responsibilities were longitudinally related to poorer mental health outcomes, operationalised as higher fear of COVID-19, anxiety, and depression, and lower wellbeing. Elevated young adult caregiving is an emerging significant public health issue that should be addressed through a multipronged approach that includes education about young adult carer needs for personnel across all relevant sectors and flexible care plans for ill family members that include a 'whole family' biopsychosocial approach.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Introduction: Homelessness is an increasing public health problem, and longitudinal population-level studies examining victimization in homeless people are lacking. Objective(s): To study the risk of victimization in homeless people. Method(s): A nationwide, register-based, cohort study of all people from 15 years of age, being alive in 2001 and born in Denmark 1980-2001 was conducted. Risk of being a victim of police-recorded violent and non-violent crimes was examined according to homelessness during 2001-2015. The primary outcome was measured as incidence rate per 1000 person-years, incidence rate ratio (IRR), and cumulative incidence function. Confounders including psychiatric disorders, parental socio-economic factors, and past criminal behaviour were considered. Result(s): A total of 1,183,505 individuals (9,858,723 person-years) aged 15-35 years were included, and 184,845 experienced at least one crime victimization (40.1% (n=74,031) violent victimizations). In all, 4286 individuals (22,823 person-years) had a homeless shelter contact. Males and females with homeless experiences had elevated rates of violent victimization compared with the general population (IRR 7.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.28 to 8.18 and 3.51, 3.17 to 3.88, respectively). Increased risk remained after confounder adjustments. Homeless people with a psychiatric diagnosis had highest risk. By five years, females and males experiencing homelessness had 23% and 16% probability of any crime victimization, respectively. Conclusion(s): There is a need for more focus on the high risk of violent victimization in young people with homelessness experiences. Improved support during and after psychiatric treatment and improved collaboration between health services, homeless shelters, and the police might reduce the risk.

N2  - Background: In this study involving two supraregional transplant centers for inborn errors of immunity (IEI), we conducted an analysis of incidence, risk factors, outcome of post haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) autoimmune cytopenia (AIC) in children with IEI. Method(s): Between January 2009 and December 2018, 536 IEI patients who underwent first allogeneic HCT at the Great North Children's Hospital or Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital were included in the study. Cumulative incidence (CNI) of post- HCT AIC was calculated using a competing risk analysis, considering death and graft failure as competing events. Risk factors included for analysis were gender, age at transplant, indication for HCT, pre-HCT AIC, donor type, donor-recipient ABO matching, stem cell source, conditioning, conditioning type, serotherapy, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis, neutrophil and platelet engraftment, acute GvHD, chronic GvHD, viraemia, respiratory and enteric viral infections. All factors associated with a p value <0.10 by univariate analysis were included in a multivariate analysis using subdistribution hazard model of Fine-and-Gray. Result(s): Forty-nine children (CNI, 9%, 95% CI 8-13%) developed post-HCT AIC, with median onset at 6.5 months (range, 0.7 months to 4.2 years). Types of AIC were autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA, n = 28, 58%), immune thrombocytopenia (ITP, n = 9, 18%), autoimmune neutropenia (AIN, n = 3, 6%), AIHA + ITP (n = 5, 10%), AIHA+AIN (n = 1, 2%), AIHA+ITP+AIN (n = 1, 2%) and ITP +AIN (n = 2, 4%). Twenty-four (49%) were on immunosuppressive therapy (CSA/tacrolimus +/- steroids/others, n = 19; steroids +/- others, n = 5) at the onset of post-HCT AIC. On univariate analysis (Fig. 1), non-SCID IEI (p = 0.02), pre-HCT AIC (p < 0.001), major ABO mismatched (p = 0.007), CMV viraemia (p = 0.04), enteric viruses (p = 0.04) were significantly associated with post-HCT AIC. After multivariate analysis, pre-HCT AIC (SHR 3.99, 95% CI, 2.21-7.21, p < 0.001), major ABO mismatched (SHR 2.37, 1.27-4.45, p = 0.007) and grade II-IV aGvHD (SHR 2.01, 1.18-3.63, p = 0.01) were independently associated with post-HCT AIC. Patients with post- HCT AIC had significantly lower donor T-lymphocyte chimerism at month 12 post-HCT compared to patients without post-HCT AIC (p = 0.009, Fig. 2). Median T cell chimerism at 12 months post-HCT was 76% (10-100%) in patients with post-HCT AIC and 96% (7- 100%) in patients without post-HCT AIC. Donor myeloid chimerism at month 3, 6 and 12 post-HCT had no association with risk of AIC. CD3+ (Fig. 3) and CD4+ CD45RA+ CD27+ lymphocyte count was significant lower in patients with post-HCT AIC at month 3, month 6, and month 12 after HCT. Corticosteroid +/- high-dose IVIg achieved remission in 33% (n = 16) and the remaining patients required multimodal therapies including rituximab, bortezomib, sirolimus and MMF. Median follow-up of 4.6 years (range, 0.4-10.0) showed that 37 of 46 survivors (80%) were in complete remission, 6 (15%) were in remission with immunosuppressive therapy including sirolimus, low dose steroids or MMF, and 2 (5%) required a second HCT (1 refractory aGvHD and 1 persistent aplasia after AIHA). The transplant related mortality (TRM) in patients with post-HCT AIC was 6% (4 deaths: 3 TRM and one due to underlying disease). Conclusion(s): Strategies to reduce GvHD and improve T-lymphocyte chimerism and immune reconstitution may reduce the incidence of potentially life-threatening post-HCT AIC.

N2  - Extending research on adverse childhood experiences, this study aimed to investigate whether the prevalence of and outcomes associated with adverse adult experiences vary among racial and ethnic subgroups. Survey data were collected from 1,566 low-income women in Wisconsin using the Adult Experiences Survey. Ten major adult adversities were assessed, including items that reference an intimate partner or household member (e.g., physical or emotional abuse, substance use) along with other social and economic stressors such as homelessness and discrimination. Adverse adult experiences were highly prevalent overall, but even more so among non-Hispanic Whites than their Black and Hispanic counterparts. The results reinforce prior research on adverse childhood experiences in low-income populations. Lending further credence to these findings, tests of measurement invariance indicated that the Adult Experiences Survey demonstrated acceptable configural and scalar invariance across racial and ethnic groups. As expected, greater exposure to adult adversity was significantly related to poorer physical and mental health. These associations manifested cross-sectionally and longitudinally for observed and latent measures of adult adversity-even after controlling for adverse childhood experiences. Associations between adult adversity and health were not moderated by race/ethnicity. In sum, adverse adult experiences were unequally distributed across racial/ethnic groups, but the consequences associated with adversity appeared to be evenly dispersed.

N2  - Background: Although rates of adolescent pregnancy have been declining for decades, rates of sexually transmissible infections (STIs) continue to increase among youth. Little is known about youth's comparative concern regarding pregnancy and STIs, particularly among marginalised populations. Therefore, this study compares concerns toward unplanned pregnancy and STIs and identifies underlying reasons for these differing concerns in youth populations with elevated rates of STIs. Method(s): Fourteen focus groups were held with 92 youth in two counties in California, USA. Youth were purposefully selected from community-based organisations and schools to represent a variety of backgrounds and populations with elevated rates of pregnancy and STIs. Qualitative coding and analysis were conducted using ATLAS.ti. 7.0. Result(s): Almost all participants were youth of colour (86%), 27% identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual, and 21% had ever experienced homelessness. Although most youth were generally concerned about the consequences of contracting an STI, including the possible stigma associated with it, both males and females were more worried about an unplanned pregnancy. Emergent themes included varying concerns about the lasting consequences of unplanned pregnancies and STIs; greater visibility of pregnancy compared to infection; stigma; and limited STI prevention efforts compared to teen pregnancy prevention. Conclusion(s): By addressing the underlying concerns and varying perceptions that different groups of youth have toward STIs and pregnancy, prevention approaches and messages can be tailored, including by age, gender, sexual orientation, and for those exposed to vulnerable living situations. Additional efforts are needed to address increasing rates of STIs among young people.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)). Published by CSIRO Publishing.

N2  - Policy Points In low-income communities in the South Bronx and Puerto Rico, Puerto Rican youth are exposed to many of the same risk and protective factors for developing depression, anxiety, or psychological distress; yet it is unclear how the ethnic minority context of the South Bronx and ethnic majority context of Puerto Rico influence risk. Results from our quasi-experimental, longitudinal study demonstrate the importance of addressing social factors (parent-child relationships, youth peer relationships) for youth living in the majority context, and neighborhood and cultural factors (residential mobility, perceived discrimination, perceived social position in the neighborhood) for youth living in the minority context. Our findings support the need for tailoring programs specific to the needs of youth who reside in an ethnic majority or a minority context, since some of the risk factors might operate differently depending on context. Housing and neighborhood environment policies that address discrimination and eliminate structural inequities for ethnic minority groups may protect against the harm of minoritization on young people's mental health. Context: Puerto Rican youth growing up in low-income communities in the South Bronx and Puerto Rico are exposed to many of the same risk factors for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and psychological distress. One potentially powerful factor differs: Puerto Ricans have been socially marginalized as an ethnic minority group in the South Bronx, but are the ethnic majority of the population in Puerto Rico. A growing body of literature demonstrates the influence of neighborhood, cultural, and social factors and parental psychopathology in the development of mental health problems. An important unanswered question is whether these risk and protective factors have the same impact for youth raised as members of an ethnic majority versus minority group. Method(s): Using a population-based cohort study, with four waves of assessment from early childhood into young adulthood, we investigated whether ethnic minority context alters risk and protective factors for depression, anxiety, and psychological distress. Our longitudinal data set includes 2,491 young children at baseline (82.8% retained at wave 4). Using a quasi-experimental design, we examine how ethnic minority context can alter the development of mental health disorders as Latinx children transition to late adolescence and young adulthood. Finding(s): Some risk and protective factors operated differently across minority and majority contexts. Higher discrimination and social position were more powerful risk and protective factors, respectively, in the minority context, whereas positive peer relationships mattered more in the majority context. Children of mothers with depression were significantly more likely to develop anxiety in late adolescence and young adulthood in the majority context (60.0%) compared to the minority context (4.5%). Conclusion(s): Preventing depression and anxiety disorders in Latinx young adults may require targeting different childhood factors depending on whether they reside within the ethnic majority or minority context. People in the ethnic minority context may benefit more from policies aimed at reducing discrimination and improving economic opportunity, while people in the majority context may benefit more from opportunities for strengthening family and peer relationships.Copyright © 2022 Milbank Memorial Fund.

N2  - Importance: There have been no published randomized clinical trials with a primary outcome of socioeconomic inclusion for young people who have experienced homelessness. Objective(s): To explore whether young people exiting homelessness who received rent subsidies and adult mentorship experienced more socioeconomic inclusion relative to young people who received only rent subsidies. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This was a convergent mixed-methods, unblinded, 2-group, parallel randomized clinical trial with 1:1 allocation embedded within a community-based framework in 3 cities in Ontario, Canada. Participants were enrolled between March 1 and September 30, 2019, and were followed up through March 31, 2022. Intervention(s): Participants (n=24) were randomly assigned adult mentors (n=13) who had been recruited and screened by community partner agencies. All participants received portable rent subsidies (subsidy not tied to a specific location) for 2 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary quantitative outcomes were self-reported measures of community integration (psychological and physical) and self-esteem-proxy indicators of socioeconomic inclusion. Community integration was measured with the Community Integration Scale, with a score range of 1 to 7 for the physical component and 4 to 20 for the psychological component; higher scores indicate higher integration. Self-esteem was measured with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, with a score range of 0 to 30; higher scores indicate greater self-esteem. Secondary quantitative outcomes included social connectedness, hopelessness, and academic and vocational participation. All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. Result(s): A total of 24 youths (12 women [50.0%]; mean [SD] age, 21.8 [2.2] years [range, 18-26 years]; race and ethnicity: 10 White [41.7%], 8 Black [33.3%], 2 Asian [8.3%], 2 Indigenous [8.3%], and 2 different choice [8.3%]) transitioned out of homelessness and into market-rent housing. All youths in the group that received mentorship and in the group that did not receive mentorship had stable or nonsignificant improvements in all study outcomes at the primary end point of 18 months compared with baseline (mean [SD] Community Integration Scale psychological score: mentorship group, 11.3 [2.6] at baseline and 11.2 [3.9] at 18 months; no-mentorship group, 10.8 [4.1] at baseline and 13.2 [2.9] at 18 months; mean [SD] Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score: mentorship group, 16.0 [4.6] at baseline and 18.1 [5.2] at 18 months; no-mentorship group, 16.3 [6.1] at baseline and 19.6 [5.7] at 18 months). However, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the Community Integration Scale psychological score (adjusted mean difference, -2.0; 95% CI, -5.0 to 1.0; P=.18) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale score (adjusted mean difference, -1.4; 95% CI, -5.0 to 2.3; P=.44) 18 months after randomization. Ancillary analysis suggested that youths with informal mentors (mentors outside the study) at baseline felt more psychologically integrated at 18 months relative to those with no informal mentors at baseline (adjusted mean difference, 3.6; 95% CI, 0.4-6.8; P=.03). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions made it challenging for mentors and mentees to connect, which may have affected the findings. Steady socioeconomic outcomes-potentially attributable to portable rent subsidies-are noteworthy, given the socioeconomic inequities this population has faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The possible benefit of informal mentorship warrants further investigation. This small pilot study was designed with the intention of generating data and hypotheses for a full-scale study; findings should be interpreted with caution.

N2  - The objective of the present study was to assess the association between the observed and perceived food environment and food insecurity among households with children <18 years in Lima, Peru. This was a cross-sectional study including an income-stratified random sample of households (n 329) in Villa el Salvador, a low-income district in Lima, Peru. Data were collected with a household questionnaire - including the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) and the University of Pennsylvania's Perceived Nutrition Environment Survey (NEMS-P) - and a neighbourhood food outlet census, including recording of food outlets' GPS coordinates. Three-quarters of the households interviewed were food insecure. Compared with food secure households and adjusting for socio-demographic covariates, food insecure households were more likely to disagree to having easy access (OR 5-4; 95 % CI 2-1, 13-4), high quality (OR 3-1; 95 % CI 1-7, 5-5) and variety (OR 2-5; 95 % CI 1-4, 4-6) of fresh fruits and vegetables in their neighbourhood. About 60 % (513 out of 861) of the food outlets identified in participants' neighbourhoods were classified as fresh, including markets, bodegas, and fruit and vegetable vendors. There was no difference in distance to fresh food outlets by household food insecurity; all households were on average within 52-62 m from a fresh food outlet (~2-min walk). Despite negative perceptions of their neighbourhood food environment, food insecure households had similar physical access to fresh food sources than their food secure counterparts. Thus, changes to the food environment may not alleviate food insecurity in urban poor areas of Peru. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

N2  - Indigenous youth are the fastest growing population in Canada, yet are marked by profound and disproportionate personal, societal, political, and colonial barriers that predispose them to mental health challenges, employment and educational barriers, and experiences of housing insecurity and homelessness. It is only from the perspectives and experiences of Indigenous community members themselves that we can gain appropriate insights into effective supports, meaningful interventions, and accessible pathways to security. This paper will explore the mental health of Indigenous youth who are at risk of, or who have experienced, homelessness, as well as the lifelong perspectives, teachings, and guidance from Indigenous Elders and traditional knowledge keepers; their perspectives are weaved throughout, in order to provide a more effective means to addressing holistic healing and the mental health needs of Indigenous homeless youth. As educators, researchers and clinicians who have sought to understand this issue in more depth, our analysis aims to raise awareness about the complexities of Indigenous youth homelessness and push back against systemic barriers that contribute to homelessness, fail young people, and subject them to oppression. We also offer recommendations from a clinical perspective in order for clinicians, researchers and those working within communities to serve our Indigenous youth with a diverse set of methods that are tailored and ethical in their approach.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

N2  - BackTrack is a multi-component, community-based program designed to build capacity amongst high-risk young people. The aim of this study was to conduct a benefit-cost analysis of BackTrack, which was implemented in Armidale, a rural town in New South Wales, Australia. Costs and benefits were identified, measured and valued in 2016 Australian dollars. Costs were estimated from program financial and administrative records. Benefits were estimated using a pre-post design and conservative economic assumptions. Benefits included education attendance or completion; employment; engagement with health service providers; reduced homelessness; economic productivity; reduced vandalism to local infrastructure; reduced youth crime; reduced engagement with the justice system; and program income generated by participants. The counterfactual baseline was zero educational outcome, based on discussions with BackTrack staff and expert informants. We tested this assumption compared to the assumption that participants had a Year 8 education. There was evidence of significant quantifiable improvements in several outcomes: high school attendance or completion, vocational education attendance or completion, unskilled or vocationally qualified employment and economic productivity. Reduced homelessness, engagement with health services and acquisition of job readiness skills, as well as reduced local infrastructure vandalism and reduced crime were further quantifiable improvements. The net social benefit of BackTrack was estimated at $3,267,967 with a benefit-cost ratio of 2.03, meaning that every dollar invested in BackTrack would return $2.03 in benefits. BackTrack represents a viable funding option for a government interested in addressing the needs of high-risk young people.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

T1  - Meeting housing needs of child welfare-involved families: Policy insights from simulation modeling

Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Background: Inadequate housing contributes to the risk of family separation in nearly one-quarter of child maltreatment investigations. Child welfare struggles to identify and address the demand for housing assistance. A range of housing interventions shows promise for stabilizing families. Still, aid remains difficult to access, and little evidence exists for prioritizing households to interventions. Inefficient decisions about who to serve with scarce housing resources threaten to diminish resources and unintentionally place children at greater risk. Objective(s): The present study leverages computational modeling to simulate the complex dynamics of coordinated child welfare response to inadequate housing. Simulations address the lack of microdata on current service delivery to inform policy-making that protects children from family insecurity. Participants and settings: A series of simulated policy experiments test strategies for maximizing access to appropriate housing assistance and minimizing system-wide family separations using US estimates of housing insecurity and child welfare involvement. Models incorporate the feedback loops involved in seeking and waiting for needed services, using information on national rates of housing insecurity among child welfare-involved families. Result(s): Results demonstrate population-level improvements in family stability from enhanced targeting of housing assistance to families most likely to benefit, plus expanded access to housing interventions. Neither improved screening procedures nor more housing supports alone improve child welfare outcomes. Conclusion(s): Findings emphasize the importance of data-driven upstream policies for protecting inadequately housed children at risk of maltreatment.Copyright © 2022

N2  - HIV researchers use short messaging service (SMS)-based surveys to monitor health behaviors more closely than what would be possible with in-person assessment. Benefits are tempered by nonresponse to completing surveys. Understanding response patterns and their associated study participant characteristics would guide more tailored use of SMS-based surveys for HIV studies. We examined response to weekly 7-item SMS surveys administered as part of an HIV prevention trial. Using Mixture hidden Markov models (MHMM), we identified the underlying response patterns shared by subgroups of participants over time and quantified the association between these response patterns and participant characteristics. Three underlying response patterns were identified; responders, responders with phone-related errors, and non-responders. Non-responders versus responders were more likely to be younger, male, cis-gender, Black and Latinx participants with histories of homelessness, incarceration, and social support service utilization. Responders with phone-related errors compared to non-responders were more likely to be Black, Latinx, female, students, and have a history of incarceration and social support service utilization. More nuanced results from MHMM analyses better inform what strategies to use for increasing SMS response rates, including assisting in securing phone ownership/service for responders with phone-related errors and identifying alternative strategies for non-responders. Actively collecting and monitoring non-delivery notification data available from SMS gateway service companies offers another opportunity to identify and connect with participants when they are willing but unable to respond during follow-up.Copyright © 2022.

N2  - This systematic review assessed peer-reviewed research studies on mortality rates of the homeless population within the United States. Extrapolated data included definitions of homelessness, mortality data sources, findings on mortality rates, and causes of premature mortality. Results demonstrate that individuals experiencing homelessness die earlier than comparison groups not experiencing homelessness. Methodology and findings varied across studies. Subpopulations included veterans, families, youth, and unsheltered. Causes of death varied across subpopulations and changed over time. Top causes of death, predominantly determined by ICD codes, stemmed from neoplasms, heart disease, and substance use disorder. Sources used for mortality data included the National Death Index (NDI), the Social Security Death Index (SSDI), state death occurrence files, and city vital statistics. Important research foci include standardization, subpopulation variations, policy implications, and the influence of mortality risk factors, such as poverty and racism.

N2  - The Identifying Depression Early in Adolescence Risk Score (IDEA-RS) has been externally assessed in samples from four continents, but North America is lacking. Our aim here was to evaluate the performance of the IDEA-RS in predicting future onset of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in an adolescent population-based sample in the United States of America - the Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS). We applied the intercept and weights of the original IDEA-RS model developed in Brazil to generate individual probabilities for each participant of the GSMS at age 15 (N = 1029). We then evaluated the performance of such predictions against the diagnosis of MDD at age 19 using simple, case-mix corrected and refitted models. Furthermore, we compared how prioritizing the information provided by parents or by adolescents affected performance. The IDEA-RS exhibited a C-statistic of 0.63 (95% CI 0.53-0.74) to predict MDD in the GSMS when applying uncorrected weights. Case-mix corrected and refitted models enhanced performance to 0.69 and 0.67, respectively. No significant difference was found in performance by prioritizing the reports of adolescents or their parents. The IDEA-RS was able to parse out adolescents at risk for a later onset of depression in the GSMS cohort with above chance discrimination. The IDEA-RS has now showed above-chance performance in five continents.Copyright © 2022 The Authors

N2  - Background: Current guidelines for the management of childhood wasting primarily focus on the provision of therapeutic foods and the treatment of medical complications. However, many children with wasting live in food-secure households, and multiple studies have demonstrated that the etiology of wasting is complex, including social, nutritional, and biological causes. We evaluated the contribution of household food insecurity, dietary diversity, and the consumption of specific food groups to the time to recovery from wasting after hospital discharge. Method(s): We conducted a secondary analysis of the Childhood Acute Illness Network (CHAIN) cohort, a multicenter prospective study conducted in six low- or lower-middle-income countries. We included children aged 6-23 months with wasting (mid-upper arm circumference [MUAC] <= 12.5 cm) or kwashiorkor (bipedal edema) at the time of hospital discharge. The primary outcome was time to nutritional recovery, defined as a MUAC > 12.5 cm without edema. Using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, study site, HIV status, duration of hospitalization, enrollment MUAC, referral to a nutritional program, caregiver education, caregiver depression, the season of enrollment, residence, and household wealth status, we evaluated the role of reported food insecurity, dietary diversity, and specific food groups prior to hospitalization on time to recovery from wasting during the 6 months of posthospital discharge. Finding(s): Of 1286 included children, most participants (806, 63%) came from food-insecure households, including 170 (13%) with severe food insecurity, and 664 (52%) participants had insufficient dietary diversity. The median time to recovery was 96 days (18/100 child-months (95% CI: 17.0, 19.0)). Moderate (aHR 1.17 [0.96, 1.43]) and severe food insecurity (aHR 1.14 [0.88, 1.48]), and insufficient dietary diversity (aHR 1.07 [0.91, 1.25]) were not significantly associated with time to recovery. Children who had consumed legumes and nuts prior to diagnosis had a quicker recovery than those who did not (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.21 [1.01,1.44]). Consumption of dairy products (aHR 1.13 [0.96, 1.34], p = 0.14) and meat (aHR 1.11 [0.93, 1.33]), p = 0.23) were not statistically significantly associated with time to recovery. Consumption of fruits and vegetables (aHR 0.78 [0.65,0.94]) and breastfeeding (aHR 0.84 [0.71, 0.99]) before diagnosis were associated with longer time to recovery. Conclusion(s): Among wasted children discharged from hospital and managed in compliance with wasting guidelines, food insecurity and dietary diversity were not major determinants of recovery.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Youth at-risk for HIV are also at-risk for mental health disorders and psychiatric hospitalization. Understanding the association between engagement in HIV prevention, concurrent risk behaviors, and psychiatric hospitalization may lead to improvements in integrated prevention and mental health treatment efforts. Youth at-risk for HIV, aged 14-24 years old, predominantly Black/African American and Latinx (75%) were recruited through youth-serving clinics and community sites in Los Angeles (n = 839) and New Orleans (n = 647). We compared youth with and without histories of psychiatric hospitalization on engagement in HIV prevention, concurrent risk behaviors, and demographic characteristics. We examined predictors of hospitalization using multiple imputations for missing data. Hospitalized youth (30%) were more involved in HIV programs, but were less likely to use PrEP/PEP or condoms than non-hospitalized youth. The odds of hospitalization were higher for transgender/gender nonconforming youth relative to cisgender youth; the OR was increased after adjustment for concurrent risk behaviors. Hospitalization was associated with homelessness, trauma, incarceration, substance use, and involvement in substance abuse treatment programs. There is a continuing need to integrate the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders into HIV prevention programs to better address multiple challenges faced by vulnerable youth.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Importance: Some jurisdictions used hotels to provide emergency noncongregate shelter and support services to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection among people experiencing homelessness (PEH). A subset of these shelter-in-place (SIP) hotel guests were high users of acute health services, and the association of hotel placement with their service use remains unknown. Objective(s): To evaluate the association of SIP hotel placements with health services use among a subset of PEH with prior high acute health service use. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This study used a matched retrospective cohort design comparing health services use between PEH with prior high service use who did and did not receive a SIP hotel placement, from April 2020 to April 2021. The setting was 25 SIP hotels in San Francisco, California, with a daily capacity of 2500 people. Participants included PEH who were among the top 10% high users of acute medical, mental health, and substance use services and who had 3 or more emergency department (ED) visits in the 9 months before the implementation of the SIP hotel program. Data analysis for this study was performed from February 2021 to May 2022. Exposures: SIP hotel placement with on-site supportive services. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were ED visits, hospitalizations and bed days, psychiatric emergency visits, psychiatric hospitalizations, outpatient mental health and substance use visits, and outpatient medical visits. Result(s): Of 2524 SIP guests with a minimum of 90-day stays, 343 (13.6%) met criteria for high service use. Of 686 participants with high service use (343 SIP group; 343 control), the median (IQR) age was 54 (43-61) years, 485 (70.7%) were male, 283 (41.3%) were Black, and 337 (49.1%) were homeless for more than 10 years. The mean number of ED visits decreased significantly in the high-user SIP group (1.84 visits [95% CI, 1.52-2.17 visits] in the 90 days before SIP placement to 0.82 visits [95% CI, 0.66-0.99 visits] in the 90 days after SIP placement) compared with high-user controls (decrease from 1.33 visits [95% CI, 1.39-1.58 visits] to 1.00 visits [95% CI, 0.80-1.20 visits]) (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.75; P <.001). The mean number of hospitalizations decreased significantly from 0.41 (95% CI, 0.30-0.51) to 0.14 (95% CI, 0.09-0.19) for SIP guests vs 0.27 (95% CI, 0.19-0.34) to 0.22 (95% CI, 0.15-0.29) for controls (IRR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27-063; P <.001). Inpatient hospital days decreased significantly from a mean of 4.00 (95% CI, 2.44-5.56) to 0.81 (95% CI, 0.40-1.23) for SIP guests vs 2.27 (95% CI, 1.27-3.27) to 1.85 (95% CI, 1.06-2.65) for controls (IRR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.12-0.54; P <.001), as did psychiatric emergency visits, from a mean of 0.03 (95% CI, 0.01-0.05) to 0.01 (95% CI, 0.00-0.01) visits for SIP guests vs no change in the control group (IRR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.11-0.51; P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that in a population of PEH with high use of acute health services, SIP hotel placement was associated with significantly reduced acute care use compared with high users without a placement..Copyright © 2022 American Institute of Physics Inc..

N2  - Background: We conducted a scoping review to examine the literature regarding pregnancy-related morbidities among birthing individuals and infants experiencing housing instability (HI). Method(s): Articles were identified through electronic database searches, using numerous search terms related to pregnancy and housing. US studies published in English between 1991 and 2019 were included. Peer-reviewed qualitative and quantitative articles were synthesized and critically appraised by 2 reviewers using quality appraisal tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Result(s): Inconsistent definitions for HI weakened the rigor of aggregate findings, and birthing individual outcomes were underreported compared with infant outcomes (n = 9 095 499 women, 11 articles). Many studies reported mental health-related outcomes among birthing individuals with HI. Discussion(s): Study sampling approaches and lack of a standard definition of HI limit review findings, but examining this relationship is critical to understanding the effect of social determinants on birthing individual health. Future research should address the nescience regarding birthing individual outcomes in this population. Policy-level advocacy addressing social determinants must also refine policy impacting community-based prenatal programs and services for the birthing individual with HI.Copyright © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

N2  - Introduction: Across the world, nutritional problems related to complementary feeding practices were among the leading killers for most of under-5 children. Timely initiation of complementary feeding was found to be a protective factor for stunting, furthermore, inappropriate timing of complementary feeding initiation was a risk factor for stunting and wasting, respectively. Therefore, this study intended to identify maternal and household determinants of complementary feeding initiation time among children aged 6 to 23 months in Gedeo Zone, South Ethiopia. Method(s): A community-based unmatched case-control study was conducted. Multistage sampling technique was used to get a total of 360 (equal proportion of cases and control) children with the age of between 6 and 23 months from their kebeles from March to May 2021. Data was collected by using face-to-face interview with structured questionnaires. It was entered into Epi data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Variables having p <= 0.25 at bivariate analysis were fitted to multivariable analysis. Multivariable logistic regression model was used at 95% confidence interval and with P-Value < 0.05. Result(s): In this study, marital status [AOR = 9.04, 95% CI= (2.32, 35.16)], maternal level of education (AOR = 0.14, 95% CI= (0.03, 0.68)), household feeding decision maker (AOR = 5.37, 95% CI= (1.95, 14.78)), household food insecurity (AOR = 3.35, 95% CI (1.25, 8.95)), household feeding preference [AOR = 2.79, 95% CI (1.21, 6.41)], family perception of breast feeding initiation time (AOR = 2.57, 95% CI (1.23, 5.39)), knowledge [AOR = 3.43 (95% CI (1.68, 4.67))] and perception on availability of health facility (AOR = 5.04, 95% CI (1.82, 13.94)) were determinants of complementary feeding initiation practices. Conclusion(s): Marital status, maternal level of education, household feeding decision maker, household food insecurity, household feeding preference, family perception of breast feedinginitiation time, knowledge, and perception on availability of health facilities were determinants of complementary feeding initiation practices. Complementary consumption should be promoted among women who have a negative opinion of complementary feeding, and women should be empowered to make better decisions about feeding their babies.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s)

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a brief intervention to promote responsible substance use and safe sex behaviors in youths experiencing homelessness (YEH). Method(s): DESIGN: A Solomon four-group (double randomized controlled trial) longitudinal design with repeated measures (3- and 6-month follow-ups) was used in drop-in centers for YEH in Austin, Texas and Columbus, Ohio from which 602 youths, 18-24 years-old (M = 21 +/- 1.8), 50% white; 69.9% heterosexual were recruited. A manualized one-on-one intervention consisted of six modules delivered via laptop computers. Modules focused on communication, goal-setting, substance use refusal, safe sex behaviors, enhanced psychological capital (hope, optimism, resilience, self-efficacy, gratitude), and life satisfaction. Valid and reliable measures of hope, optimism, future time perspective, resilience, social connectedness, gratitude, condom intention, self-efficacy for safe sex, safe sex behaviors, self-efficacy for substance use refusal, and life satisfaction were used to collect data for which three hypotheses were tested, using intent to treat, with multi-level modeling (R). Result(s): The analysis showed partial support for all hypotheses: (1) post-test outcomes were greater than pretests; (2) intervention group outcomes were greater than control group measures; and (3) significant effects for pretesting. YEH in Ohio completed significantly more sessions than YEH in Texas (p = .001), but took significantly longer to complete all six sessions (p = .001). Discussion(s): This brief intervention had significant effects on YEH to promote healthy attitudes and behaviors that merit further testing in larger samples.Copyright © 2022 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine

N2  - Behavioral weight loss (BWL) for pediatric obesity includes guidance on improving the home food environment and dietary quality; yet food insecurity presents barriers to making these changes. This study examined if home food environment, dietary quality, energy intake, and body weight changes during adolescent obesity treatment differed by food security status, and if changes in the home food environment were associated with changes in dietary quality and energy intake by food security status. Adolescents (n = 82; 13.7 +/- 1.2 years) with obesity participated in a 4-month BWL treatment. Food insecurity, home food environment (Home Food Inventory [HFI]), dietary quality (Healthy Eating Index [HEI]), energy intake, and body mass index (BMI) were assessed at baseline and post-treatment. A reduced obesogenic home food environment and improved dietary quality were observed for food secure (ps < 0.01), but not insecure households (ps > 0.05) (mean difference, HFI: -6.6 +/- 6.4 vs. -2.4 +/- 7.4; HEI: 5.1 +/- 14.4 vs. 2.7 +/- 17.7). Energy intake and BMI decreased for adolescents in food secure and insecure households (ps < 0.03) (mean difference; energy intake: -287 +/- 417 vs. -309 +/- 434 kcal/day; BMI: -1.0 +/- 1.4 vs. -0.7 +/- 1.4). BWL yielded similar reductions in energy intake and body weight yet did not offer the same benefits for improved dietary quality and the home food environment for adolescents with food insecurity.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Background: Food insecurity and housing instability, both social determinants of health (SDoH), disproportionately affect economically unstable, under-resourced US communities in which children with sickle cell disease (SCD) live. Association between these SDoH markers and dietary quality among children with SCD is unknown. Procedures: We assessed a cross-sectional sample of dyadic parent-child patients and young adult patients up to age 21 from one pediatric SCD center. Food insecurity, housing instability, and dietary quality were measured using validated US instruments and a food frequency questionnaire. Better dietary quality was defined using US dietary guidelines. Multivariate regression assessed for associations among dietary quality and food insecurity with or without (+/-) housing instability and housing instability alone. Result(s): Of 100 enrolled participants, 53% were Black and 43% Hispanic; mean age 10.6 +/- 5.6 years. Overall, 70% reported less than or equal to one economic instability: 40% housing instability alone and 30% both food insecurity and housing instability. Eighty percent received more than or equal to one federal food assistance benefit. Compared to no economic instability, food insecurity +/- housing instability was significantly associated with higher intake of higher dairy and pizza, while housing instability alone was significantly associated with higher dairy intake. Food insecurity +/- housing instability was significantly associated with lower intake of whole grains compared to housing instability alone. Conclusion(s): Our sample reported high frequencies of both food insecurity and housing instability; having more than or equal to one SDoH was associated with elements of poorer diet quality. Screening families of children with SCD for food insecurity and housing instability may identify those with potential nutrition-related social needs.Copyright © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

N2  - Introduction: Cigarette smoking and associated high-risk behaviors are prevalent among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH), making appropriately tailored interventions targeting smoking behavior important for this group. We pilot tested a brief text-messaging intervention (TMI) as an adjunct to standard care for YEH who smoke and found promising preliminary effects of the intervention on smoking cessation. The purpose of the present study was to test the TMI's effect on the secondary outcomes of other substance use (including use of other tobacco/nicotine devices) and mental health symptoms. Method(s): A total of 77 participants completed the pilot randomized controlled trial, with 40 receiving the TMI (174 automated text messages plus a group smoking counseling session and provision of nicotine patches). They completed an assessment at baseline and another three months later that evaluated use of other tobacco/nicotine devices, alcohol, marijuana, and anxiety and depression symptoms. Result(s): We found that the TMI helped to reduce secondary substance use behaviors and mental health symptoms among the participants; mainly there were medium effects of the intervention on changes in other tobacco/nicotine use, drinking, and anxiety and depression symptoms. The intervention did not have an effect on number of marijuana use days in the past month; however, past 30-day marijuana users who received the intervention benefited by reducing the number of times they used marijuana per day. Conclusion(s): In addition to helping reduce cigarette smoking, we found that a TMI for YEH was helpful in improving secondary outcomes, suggesting the promise of the TMI on benefiting YEH even beyond targeted smoking behavior. Implications: This pilot study demonstrates that by targeting cigarette smoking using a text message-based intervention among youth experiencing homelessness, effects may be seen in other areas of functioning such as other substance use and mental health.

N2  - Aims and context: This paper reports the evaluation of the Doorway program (2015-18) in Melbourne, Australia. Doorway extends the original Housing First (HF) model in providing housing support to people with precarious housing at-risk of homelessness with Serious and Persistent Mental Illnesses (SPMIs) receiving care within Victoria's public mental health system. Doorway participants source and choose properties through the open rental market, and receive rental subsidies, assistance, advocacy and brokerage support through their Housing and Recovery Worker (HRW). The aim of this study is to estimate Doorway's impact on participants' housing, quality of life and mental health service use. Methodology: The study employed a a quasi-experimental study design with a comparison group, adjusted for ten potential confounders. The primary outcome measure was days of secure housing per participant. Secure housing status, health service usage and quality of life (HoNOS) data were extracted from participants' electronic hospital and Doorway records in deidentified, non-reidentifiable form. Analysis for continuous outcome variables was based on multivariate GLM modelling. Result(s): Doorway housed 89 (57%) of 157 accepted participants. The 157 Doorway participants overall were also housed for significantly more days (119.4 extra days per participant) than control participants, albeit after some delay in locating and moving into housing (mean 14 weeks). There was a significant, positive Doorway effect on health outcomes (all and one dimension of the HoNOS). Doorway participants had significantly reduced length of stay during acute and community hospital admissions (7.4 fewer days per participant) compared with the control group. Conclusion(s): The Doorway model represents a new and substantial opportunity to house, enhance health outcomes and reduce mental health service use for people with SPMIs from the public mental health sector and at-risk of homelessness.Copyright © The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2021.

N2  - Purpose: This study provides information on COVID-19 vaccination and attitudes among young adults with recent experiences of homelessness. Method(s): Participants (n = 134) from a clinical trial of a risk reduction program for youth experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles completed survey items about COVID-19 vaccinations between March and October 2021. Result(s): A total of 29% of respondents were vaccinated, and 50% were not interested in getting vaccinated. Among the unvaccinated, 58% had not been offered the vaccine; furthermore, 38%-45% had strong distrust of the vaccine and were worried about its harmfulness. Vaccination status was generally unrelated to demographics, housing instability, service use, substance use, or mental health. Discussion(s): Our data suggest that vaccination rates are lower among young adults with recent experiences of homelessness than those in the general US population. The results suggest a need for greater direct outreach that includes both offering the vaccine and addressing misconceptions about its safety to increase vaccination rates in this population.Copyright © 2021 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine

N2  - Illicit drug use and cognitive distortions confer significant risks to youth suicidal thoughts and behaviors. However, there has been limited evidence regarding the efficacy of suicide prevention interventions with homeless youth, especially studies testing whether such interventions can reduce the risk for suicidal ideation associated with illicit drug use. Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) between the ages of 18 to 24 years were recruited from a drop-in center. Youth were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Youth reported their illicit drug use, cognitive distortions, and suicidal ideation 4 times over 9 months. A multiple-group multilevel structural equation model showed that higher illicit drug use at baseline predicted a slower reduction in cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation in the TAU group. These associations were not found in the CTSP + TAU group, suggesting an interruption of such risk from illicit drug use. Findings suggest that CTSP can reduce the risk of illicit drug use as a treatment barrier towards cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation among homeless youth, with implications to improve treatment efforts and to reduce premature mortality in a vulnerable population.Copyright © 2021

N2  - Adequate dietary diversity among infants is often suboptimal in developing countries. We assessed the impact of nutrition counselling using a digital job aid on dietary diversity of children aged 6-23 months using data from a cluster randomised controlled trial in Bangladesh. The trial had five arms, each with 25 clusters. The four intervention arms provided counselling using a digital job aid and different prenatal and post-natal combinations of lipid-based supplements and the comparison arm with usual practice. We enrolled 1500 pregnant women and followed them until the children reached their second birthday. We developed a tablet-based system for intervention delivery, data collection and project supervision. We combined the four intervention arms (n = 855), in which community health workers (CHWs) provided age-appropriate complementary feeding counselling, to compare against the comparison arm (n = 403). We calculated the outcome indicators from the children's 24-h dietary recalls. Overall, the intervention increased the mean dietary diversity score by 0.09 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.2-0.16) and odds of minimum dietary diversity by 18% (95% CI: 0.99-1.40). However, there was a significant interaction on the effect of the intervention on dietary diversity by age. The mean dietary diversity score was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.11-0.37) higher in the intervention than in the comparison arm at 9 months and 0.14 (95% CI: 0.01-27) at 12 months of age. The intervention effect was non-significant at an older age. Overall, consumption of flesh food was 1.32 times higher in the intervention arm (odds ratio [OR] 1.32, 95% CI: 1.11-1.57) in 6-23 months of age. The intervention significantly improved child dietary diversity score in households with mild and moderate food insecurity by 0.27 (95% CI: 0.06-0.49) and 0.16 (0.05-27), respectively, but not with food-secure and severely food-insecure households. Although the study did not evaluate the impact of digital job aid alone, the findings indicate the utility of nutrition counselling by CHWs using a digital job aid to improve child feeding practices in broader programmes.Copyright © 2021 International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Reseach, Bangladesh (icddr,b).

Service bans, which refer to temporary or permanent disallowances from a program or organization, are an underresearched phenomenon that can leave people experiencing homelessness without needed supports. This exploratory study examined the factors associated with shelter bans among people experiencing homelessness using secondary data from two Canadian studies: (1) a multisite randomized controlled trial of Housing First (At Home/Chez Soi Demonstration Project) and (2) a cross-sectional survey of youth experiencing homelessness across Canada (2019 Without a Home-National Youth Homelessness Survey). The two datasets were analyzed separately using logistic regression models with similar predictors to maximize the comparability of the results. Participants who experienced homelessness at an earlier age and had recent criminal justice system involvement were more likely to have shelter bans in both datasets. Impaired impulse control, more chronic medical conditions and living in Toronto were associated with increased likelihood of shelter bans in the At Home/Chez Soi dataset, whereas more adverse childhood experiences, physical violence victimization, engagement in survival sex behaviours and longer current episodes of homelessness were significant predictors of bans in the Without A Home dataset. Overall, the findings suggest that victimization and criminalization during homelessness may increase the risk of shelter loss from bans and further exclusion. The observed regional differences also highlight the potential limits of individual-level predictors. Further research is needed on shelter ban outcomes, as well as how capacity limits and organizational policies affect banning decisions.Copyright © 2022. The New York Academy of Medicine.

N2  - There is a need for positive youth development/strengths-based approaches to support the wellbeing and social inclusion of young people experiencing or at risk of homelessness. My Strengths Training for LifeTM (MST4LifeTM) uses a strengths-based approach with the aim to improve young people's resilience, self-worth, wellbeing and engagement in education, employment, and training. This mixed methods study assessed the fidelity of delivery style of the MST4LifeTM programme, the extent to which frontline service staff can delivery psychologically informed programmes to service users and identified barriers and enablers to delivering with fidelity to the intended style. Observations of programme delivery (two facilitators per session) took place across early, middle, and late phases of the programme across a pilot phase (n = 18) and main study (n = 45). Facilitators also completed self-reflection forms following each session. The mean observation score was 82.2 +/- 15.7 %, and facilitator self-report mean adherence score was 89.3 +/- 6.2 % which indicate that the programme was delivered with high fidelity. Quantitative data was also analysed using non-parametric statistical test (Mann-Whitney U Test). There was a significant difference between observation scores for deliverers with postgraduate psychology training compared to deliverers without postgraduate psychology training (p = .029). Qualitative data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Barriers and enablers included communication, frontline staff support, logistics, and participant behaviours. Overall, this study highlights that despite the challenges of delivering complex community programmes to young people experiencing homelessness, it was possible for frontline service staff to deliver MST4LifeTM with high fidelity.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Research exploring associations between exposure to social determinants of health and breastfeeding is needed to identify breastfeeding barriers. Housing insecurity and household conditions (chaos and crowding) may affect breastfeeding by increasing maternal stress and discomfort and decreasing time available to breastfeed. RESEARCH AIM: We aimed to examine the relationships between housing insecurity, breastfeeding exclusivity intention during the early postnatal period, and breastfeeding exclusivity at 6 months postpartum among a sample "at risk" for suboptimal breastfeeding rates. METHOD(S): This study is a secondary data analysis of a longitudinal study at two time periods. Data were collected from English- and Spanish-speaking, Medicaid-eligible mother-infant dyads (N = 361) at near-birth and child aged 6 months, in New York City and Pittsburgh. Structural equation modeling was used to examine direct and indirect effects of housing insecurity on breastfeeding exclusivity at child aged 6 months. RESULT(S): The path model showed that experiencing more markers of housing insecurity (i.e., foreclosure/eviction threat, history of homelessness, late rent) was predictive of significantly lower breastfeeding exclusivity at 6 months. This was partially mediated through less exclusive breastfeeding intention during the early postnatal period. Greater household crowding was associated with 6-month breastfeeding exclusivity when mediated by intention. Household crowding had differential effects by study site and participant race/ethnicity. CONCLUSION(S): Refinement of housing insecurity as a multi-dimensional construct can lead to the development of standardized data collection instruments, inform future methodological decisions in research addressing social determinants of health, and can inform the development of responsive individual- and structural-level interventions.The data used in this study were collected as part of the SMART Beginnings Randomized Controlled Trial (NCT02459327 registered at ClinicalTrials.gov).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Household food insecurity persists in the United States and has important implications for health and well-being. Food insecurity in female-identified caregivers is particularly concerning, given its association with their mental health and adverse health outcomes for their children. Food insecurity is associated with disordered eating but, to our knowledge, no prior studies have examined an association between food insecurity and food addiction. OBJECTIVE(S): Our aim was to examine whether food insecurity is associated with higher food addiction symptom endorsement in low-income female adults. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of baseline data from a quasi-experimental study of a mindfulness-based intervention on gestational weight gain among low-income pregnant individuals and an observational study of low-income families. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants in study 1 (n = 208) were English-speaking, low-income pregnant individuals with overweight or obesity, recruited in California from 2011 to 2013. Participants in study 2 (n = 181) were English-speaking, low-income female caregivers for children aged 8 through 10 years, recruited in Michigan from 2018 to 2019. Both studies recruited participants from community health clinics, social service agencies, and online advertisements. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was food addiction symptoms, assessed by the Yale Food Addiction Scale. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Multivariate Poisson regression was used to examine the association between household food insecurity and food addiction symptoms in each sample, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. RESULT(S): In study 1, pregnant individuals in food-insecure households reported 21% higher food addiction symptoms than pregnant individuals in food-secure households (incidence rate ratio 1.21; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.47; P = .047). In study 2, caregivers in food-insecure households had 56% higher food addiction symptoms than caregivers in food-secure households (incidence rate ratio 1.56; 95% CI 1.01 to 2.40; P = .045). CONCLUSION(S): These findings provide preliminary support for a relationship between household food insecurity and food addiction. Future research should examine potential mechanisms and whether interventions to reduce food insecurity lower risk of food addiction.Copyright © 2022 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

N2  - This study assessed the prevalence and predictors of not eating lunch on school days among Canadian children using dietary data from the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey-Nutrition (n = 2,991 children aged 6-17 years). On a given school day, more than 1 in 20 students reported eating no lunch. Students were more likely to miss lunch if they were older, lived in a food insecure household, or smoked. Sex, ethnicity, income and weight status were not associated with lunch consumption. Future research is needed to fully understand the frequency, causes and consequences of missing lunch on school days in Canada.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

N2  - This study assessed the acceptability of porridge from a corn-common bean flour blend to increase the diversity of complementary foods in Malawi. Porridges prepared using commercial corn-soybean flour (C-CSB), homemade orange corn-soybean flour (H-CSB), and orange corn-common bean flour (CCBB) were evaluated by 101 pairs of mothers and their respective children aged from 6 to 24 months. A home use test (HUT) setup was used in this study, and the flours were given sequentially to participating households following a randomized complete block design. Each sample type was evaluated for 3 days in a row followed by a 1-day break (washout period) between sample types. Based on aggregate mean scores, all the samples were liked by both the children and their mothers. However, clustering results revealed two distinct consumer segments for mothers as well as for children. Most of the mothers (59.4% in cluster 1) liked all the samples, while the minority (cluster 2) were neutral (neither like nor dislike) regarding the H-CSB porridge. Likewise, most children (66.3% in cluster 2) liked all the samples, while the rest in cluster 1 did not like CCBB porridge. Infants (<=12 months) and those from food-insecure households, respectively, were 5.42 and 6.75 times more likely to like the CCBB porridge than their counterparts. The study has demonstrated the potential of introducing CCBB complementary porridge in Malawi and possibly in other countries with similar food preferences and socioeconomic stature. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The study provides a solution to the limited diversity of complementary foods in sub-Saharan Africa and Malawi in particular. The findings can help food scientists, nutritionists, marketers, and policymakers develop strategies for promoting the consumption of orange corn-common bean porridge. Furthermore, the findings can inform decisions on commercializing orange corn-common bean flour by flour processors.Copyright © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.

N2  - Background: WHO and UNICEF (1990) have recommended EBF for six months, followed by an introduction of complementary foods at the age of six months with continued breastfeeding for the first 24 months or more. Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) during the first 6 months of life reduces infant morbidity and mortality. According to Ethiopia Demographic Health Survey (DHS), only 58% of children were exclusively breastfed during the first 6 months of age. Objective(s): The study aimed to identify time to early cessation of EBF and associated factors among 6-12 months old children in Lanfuro Woreda, Silte Zone. Method(s): A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Lanfuro Woreda, Silte Zone, from March to April 2017. A total of 636 mothers with 6-12 months old infants from ten randomly selected kebeles were included. Both quantitative and subjective information assortment techniques were utilized. The Kaplan-Meier curve with log-rank test was used to compare the survival difference by the selected covariates. Both bivariate (P < 0.25) and multivariable (P < 0.05) Cox Proportional Hazards model were fitted to identify factors predicting time to early cessation of EBF. Result(s): The median duration of exclusive breastfeeding was 6.22 months. The highest proportion of cessation of exclusive breastfeeding occurred during the first four to five months. Early cessation of exclusive breastfeeding was observed in 295 (48%). Place of residence (AHR: 1.6; 95% CI = 1.14-2.20), knowledge on EBF (AHR = 1.31; 95% CI = 1.02-1.68), type of delivery (AHR: 2.41; 95% CI = 2.24-3.68), pre-lacteal feeding (AHR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.32-2.36) and household food insecurity (AHR = 5.02; 95% CI = 3.89-6.50) were significant independent factors which were associated with time to early cessation of exclusive breastfeeding. Conclusion and recommendation: There are still sizable proportions of children not enjoying exclusive breastfeeding for the first full six months. Being an urban resident and coming from food-insecure households, giving birth by CS, having low knowledge on EBF, and giving pre-lacteal feeding were factors associated with time to early cessation of EBF. Multi-sectoral action should be taken for respective predictors of time to early cessation of EBF.Copyright © 2022 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism

N2  - Women's nutritional status remains poor in South Asia, impacting maternal and infant health outcomes. Women's household status is also low, as evidenced by eating behaviours. We started with triadic qualitative interviews with newly married women, husbands and mothers-in-law to explore the link between women's status and eating patterns, followed by longitudinal data from a cohort of 200 newly married women in rural Nepal to measure associations over time. Quantitative data were collected every 6 months for 18 months (four rounds of data) between 2018 and 2020. Interviews suggested that household relationships, women's status, and how much and what types of food she was given were intricately linked. Using mixed effects logistic regression models, we explore the association between markers of changing women's status (becoming pregnant, giving birth and working outside the home) on two outcomes (eating last always/usually and achieving minimum dietary diversity). We also explore for interaction between women's status and household food insecurity. Pregnancy increases women's dietary diversity, but this is not sustained post-partum. Women who work outside the home are less likely to eat last in the household. Food insecurity is associated with both the order of household eating and dietary diversity. Interactions between food insecurity and giving birth suggested that women who give birth in food insecure households are more likely to eat last in the household. Changes in women's household status are associated with some improvements in dietary diversity and order of household eating, but the associations are not long-lasting and depend on food security status.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

T1  - Understanding female adolescent 'runaways' and the implications of their decisions in Tigray, northern Ethiopia

Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Objective: This study aimed to understand the main factors influencing the decision of adolescent girls to run away from home in Tigray, northern Ethiopia, and to explore the social and cultural construction of female adolescent runaways in this region. Method(s): In-depth qualitative interviews with seven runaway adolescent girls and six women married at an early age (11-16 years old) were conducted in Wukro and Mekelle in Tigray to investigate why the girls escaped from home and how communities responded to these decisions. Result(s): Findings suggest that the immediate trigger that led all the young participants to run away was to escape an arranged marriage, except in one 'romantic' elopement case. Individual and structural factors, such as child maltreatment and educational aspirations, and new family law respectively, also contributed to the decision to escape. Conclusion(s): Adolescent runaways seem to be ignored or normalized within the community in Tigray and, in particular, by its public institutions. This may explain why there are limited services for runaway girls, such as shelters and other forms of support. This lack of social protection structures has left these girls unprotected and exposed to a range of risks, such as early and unwanted pregnancies, labor exploitation, dropping out of school, and transactional sex. To date, this phenomenon of adolescent runaways has remained an invisible issue in Tigray as runaway girls are counted under general migration figures. Further research is needed to explore how this phenomenon is categorized at policy level in order to address runaway girls' needs as defined by them.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - BACKGROUND: Social networks may play positive and negative roles in the lives of young adults experiencing homelessness (YEH) who are transitioning into housing. Social networks can influence their alcohol and/or other drug (AOD) use, as well as provide immediate and long-term support necessary for a successful transition. METHOD(S): We adapted a four-session computer-assisted motivational interviewing social network intervention (MI-SNI) for YEH transitioning into housing. We iteratively adapted and beta tested the intervention for delivery by case managers at an organization that provides supportive housing to YEH. We conducted a focus group with agency staff (n=6), role-play exercises with case managers (n=3), and semi-structured interviews with residents (n=6). Interview data were thematically analyzed with open coding. This study presents the first adaptation of an innovative social network-based motivational intervention to reduce AOD use and increase stable, prosocial supportive connections via visualizations of the structure and composition of the individual's social network. RESULT(S): Participants rated sessions as "moderately" to "very" helpful and "good" quality on average. Participants agreed that the sessions were helpful, understandable, and satisfying and would work for new residents. Themes emerged in four broad categories: (1) Acceptability, (2) Positive benefits, (3) Visualization reactions, and (4) MI-SNI interface reactions. For the acceptability category, three sub-themes emerged: (1) understandability, (2) enjoyability and ease of use, (3) and barriers to acceptability. Five sub-themes emerged about the intervention's likelihood to trigger positive benefits: (1) learning/new insights, (2) enhancement to motivation to change, (3) making AOD changes, (4) building social support, and (5) the intervention's usefulness to some but not others. Five sub-themes also emerged from comments about the social network visualizations: (1) general positive comments, (2) understandability, (3) new insights, (4) triggering changes in social support, and (5) triggering changes in AOD use. When discussing the MI-SNI intervention interface beyond the visualizations, discussions emerged in three thematic categories: (1) discussion of name listing, (2) discussion of screen wording, and (3) the use of a computer interface to deliver the intervention. CONCLUSION(S): Results suggest that the MI-SNI is acceptable to YEH and can be feasibly delivered by case managers during case management sessions.

N2  - Background: This proof-of-concept trial examined a 6-month Prevention Plus (PP) intervention implemented in a federally qualified health center on child standardized BMI (ZBMI), using a planned clinical effect threshold of -0.16 ZBMI. The relationship between food security status and PP delivered with caregiver goals (PP+) and without caregiver goals (PP-) on energy balance behaviors (i.e., fruits and vegetables, physical activity) and child ZBMI was explored. Method(s): Seventy-three, underserved children, 4-10 years of age with a BMI >=85th percentile, were randomized to one of two interventions, PP+ and PP-, both providing 2.5 hours of contact time, implemented in five clinics by behavioral health consultants (BHCs). Outcomes were child anthropometrics (included 9-month follow-up), implementation data collected from electronic health records, and caregiver and BHC evaluations. Result(s): Children were 57.5% female and 78.1% Hispanic, with 32.9% from food-insecure households and 58.9% from households with an annual income of less than $20,000. Child ZBMI significantly (p<0.05) decreased at 6 and 9 months (-0.08+/-0.24 and -0.12+/-0.43), with only PP+ reaching the clinical threshold at 9 months (PP+: -0.20+/-0.42 vs. PP-: -0.05+/-0.42). Sixty-four percent of families attended >=50% of the sessions, and BHCs delivered 78.5%+/-23.5% of components at attended sessions. Caregivers were satisfied with the intervention and BHCs found the intervention helpful/useful. No relationship with food insecurity status and outcomes was found. Conclusion(s): PP+ when delivered by a primary care provider to underserved families showed promise for producing a clinically meaningful effect. Families and providers felt the intervention was a viable treatment option.

N2  - Parents are key protective systems in the lives of children experiencing homelessness. Evidence suggests that parent emotional reactivity, expression, and regulation play a critical role in promoting adaptive parenting behaviors. Studies of emotional reactivity in parents utilize different methods, including self-report, observations, and physiological measures. However, these methods are rarely evaluated together, particularly among disadvantaged families. The present study examined how subjective (i.e., self-report), observed, and physiological measures of parent emotional reactivity relate to each other and to observed parenting behaviors in problem-solving and teaching parent-child interaction tasks. Participants included fifty 4- to 7-year-old children and their caregivers staying in an emergency homeless shelter. Observed and subjective emotional reactivity were largely uncorrelated, except for positive emotions during problem-solving tasks. Adaptive parenting behavior was related to lower scores on measures of subjective and observed negative emotions and higher observed scores for positive emotions during problem-solving tasks, as well as higher observed scores of positive emotions during teaching tasks. Physiological reactivity was not related to parenting behaviors. Results suggest that associations of emotional reactivity with parenting behavior depend on the context of the parent-child interaction and how emotional reactivity is measured.

N2  - This seminal study from Turkey investigates sexual abuse (SA) victimization, psychological symptoms, and hopelessness in female adolescents with runaway behavior. A total of 76 female adolescent participants aged 15-18 completed the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS). Among these adolescents, 63.1% (n = 48) were victims of SA, 61.8% (n = 47) had a Global Severity Index (GSI) T-score of 63 or above, and 68.4% (n = 52) had moderate-severe hopelessness. Although there was no significant difference, the SA rate was higher in those who had experienced SA before running away. 'Intrafamilial relationship problems' and 'SA-related factors' were the most frequently reported reasons for runaway behavior. Victims of SA had significantly higher scores in all BSI subdimensions and global symptom severity than those previously not SA victims. The results suggest that high levels of psychological symptoms, hopelessness, history of SA, and poor parent-child relationships are possible factors that can describe female adolescents who have run away from home. Psychosocial prevention programs involving adolescents and parents are needed to prevent at-risk female adolescents from running away from home.Copyright © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Access to appropriate health and social care is challenging for vulnerable populations. We used a 'pop-up' delivery model to bring community-based services in contact with communities with poor access to health and social care. Our aim was to examine whether pop-up events improve access to essential health and social support services for selected vulnerable communities and increase collaboration between community-based health and social services. Set in south-eastern Melbourne, two pop-up events were held, one with people at risk of homelessness attending a community lunch and the other with South Sudanese women helping at-risk youth. Providers represented 20 dental, housing, justice, employment and mental health services. We made structured observations of each event and held semi-structured interviews with consumers and providers. Pre-post surveys of managers assessed acceptability and perceived impact. We reached 100 community participants who had multiple needs, particularly for dentistry. Following the events, participants reported increased knowledge of services and access pathways, community members spoke of increased trust and partnerships between service providers were fostered. The pop-up model can increase provider collaboration and provide new options for vulnerable populations to access needed services. 'Bringing the service to the person' is a compelling alternative to asking consumers to negotiate complex access pathways. Copyright © 2022 Journal Compilation

N2  - Although the association between child sexual abuse (CSA) and homelessness among women is well documented, few studies have investigated this topic from a feminist standpoint, examining the impact of sociocultural factors such as rape culture. Based on a qualitative life course approach, individual interviews were conducted with 21 women who experienced both CSA and homelessness. Participants were between 29 to 60 years old (M = 45 years of age). Analyses revealed that CSA disclosure experiences were characterized by victim-blaming and disbelief. Women's traumatic experiences were further aggravated by these types of reactions. Finally, CSA and negative social reactions to women's disclosures of CSA were perceived as the onset of social exclusion, which lead to their homelessness. This study shows how traumatic CSA experiences and negative social reactions to their disclosure can both contribute to social exclusion and isolation, and to homelessness through the internalization of rape myths. These findings support the importance of focusing on CSA prevention to reduce social exclusion and homelessness.

N2  - In 2019-2020 we conducted a pilot study of a Nurse Practitioner clinic working with housing insecure children (0-18 years) that found high levels of developmental delay, missed immunizations and dental caries. This present non-randomized, concurrent mixed-methods study protocol explains the next phase of the research designed proving proof of concept for a Nurse Practitioner model of care for these vulnerable children. Focusing on identifying and understanding clinic admission processes, tracking referral pathways and uptake, and how many vulnerable children miss potential care and why. This will help us to understand and address gaps in health service delivery for this cohort. DESIGN: The study uses a concurrent mixed- method design where both qualitative and quantitative data are collected during the same period (between January 2021 and March 2022 as per the funding timeline). METHOD(S): The concurrent mixed-method design will collect data from: A comprehensive assessment tool used by the Nurse Practitioner to evaluate the child accessing specialist homeless services, which assess their mental, physical and social health needs. Documentation about the child's referral needs and uptake by disadvantage families. Interviews with housing insecure families, and staff/managers of the specialist homeless service. A review of Nurse Practitioner case notes. Surveys of families with children accessing the Nurse Practitioner service. DISCUSSION: Addressing the childhood impacts of family homelessness is of global importance. Structural equation modelling, from the surveys and in-depth health assessments along with the thematic analysis of the interviews with parents and staff/managers provide an understanding of the relationships between referral uptake and variables such as education, homelessness and transport accessibility. Investigating the enablers and barriers to the usual health access and our extended referral uptake impacted by family homelessness enables a better understanding of the current health gaps. IMPACT: Just over one fifth of Australian children live with their families in some form of housing instability including homelessness. These children, aged from birth to 18 years, are often disconnected from health and similar social institutions, making them an underserviced population. Our research investigates a Nurse Practitioner services that helps reconnect children with services to help avoid poor long-term health outcomes.Copyright © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of household food insecurity during the third trimester of pregnancy on the growth indicators of infants aged less than 6 months. DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal study. SETTING: 137 healthcare centres (15 cities) in Khorasan Razavi province, Iran. Data were extracted from the Sina Electronic Health Record System (SinaEHR). PARTICIPANTS: This study was conducted on 2481 mother and infant dyads during November 2016-March 2019. The Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (nine-item version) was used to measure food insecurity in the third trimester of pregnancy. Women who delivered singleton infants were included in the study, and anthropometric indices of infants were measured throughout the first 6 months of life. RESULT(S): Approximately 67 % of the participants were food secure, while 33 % had varying degrees of food insecurity. The children born to the mothers in the food-insecure households were, respectively, 2.01, 3.03, and 3.83 times more likely to be stunted at birth (95 % CI 1.17, 3.46), 4 months (95 % CI 1.21, 7.61) and 6 months of age (95 % CI 1.37, 10.68) compared to their counterparts in the food-secure households. However, there were no significant differences in mean birth weight, birth height and head circumference at birth between the two groups. CONCLUSION(S): Household food insecurity during pregnancy is a risk factor for stunting in infants aged less than 6 months. Therefore, national nutrition programs could considerably support women in food-insecure households during and before pregnancy.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The experience of homelessness for young people can affect social, emotional, and physical development, resulting in poorer physical and mental health outcomes. To reduce rates of youth homelessness, a better understanding of both risk and resilience is needed to inform future intervention development. This article presents a systematic review of published research reporting risk or resilience factors related to homelessness among young people in Western countries. METHOD(S): After thorough examination for inclusion criteria, 665 abstracts of peer-reviewed quantitative studies of risk or resilience factors for homelessness among young people (ages 0-25) that included an adequate comparison group (e.g., not homeless) were selected. After abstract and full-text screening, 16 articles were reviewed. A primary prevention framework was used to create an explanatory model for the onset of homelessness using risk and resilience factors. RESULT(S): Common risk factors for youth homelessness included difficulties with family, mental health or substance use problems, a history of problem behaviors, a history of foster care, homelessness as a child, and running away. Common protective factors included a supportive family, a college education, and high socioeconomic status. Findings were integrated into a provisional developmental model of youth homelessness risk. Clinical implications of the model for service development are discussed, and a model for monitoring homelessness risk and resilience factors is proposed. CONCLUSION(S): Factors affecting homelessness risk among youths and adults differ, with family, foster care, and schooling playing a much more important role among youths. Findings highlight opportunities for youth homelessness prevention strategies and monitoring.

N2  - Children are highly susceptible to environmental contaminants as their physiology and some metabolic pathways differ from adults. The present cross-sectional study aimed to assess whether exposure to benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o,p-xylene, and m-xylene (BTEX) affects oxidative DNA damage in street children using a biomonitoring approach. Thirty-five boys (7-13 years of age), exposed by working at a busy intersection, and 25 unexposed boys of similar age and living in the neighborhood near the busy intersection were recruited. Urinary un-metabolized BTEX levels were quantified by a headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Urinary malonaldehyde (MDA) was measured with spectrophotometry. Sociodemographic and lifestyle conditions information was collected by interviews using administered questionnaires. Exposed subjects provided urine before (BE) and after work exposure (AE), while unexposed boys gave a single morning sample. Urinary BTEX concentrations in BE samples were similar to unexposed. Concentrations in AE samples were 2.36-fold higher than observed in BE samples (p < 0.05) and higher than those in the unexposed group (p < 0.05). In addition, urinary MDA levels in AE samples were 3.2 and 3.07-times higher than in BE samples and in the unexposed group (p < 0.05). Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) increased urinary BTEX and MDA levels in both groups. Our findings confirm that street children working at busy intersections are significantly exposed to BTEX, which is associated with oxidative stress. Implementing protective measures is crucial to reduce exposure and to improve health outcomes in this group.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: In 2018, nearly half of children living in federallyfunded emergency and transitional housing programs were age five or younger.[1] Experiencing homelessness in early childhood has been associated with an increased likelihood of chronic illnesses, developmental delays, and readiness for school.[2] Several early childhood interventions have been shown to help mitigate the adverse effects of early experiences.[3] Children facing homelessness, however, have unique barriers to accessing early intervention (EI). Though the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act includes the right of homeless families to access "appropriate early childhood education programs," most eligible children experiencing homelessness do not receive these programs.[4] Methods: We recruited nineteen caregivers of children ages 3 or younger who had recently experienced or were contemporaneously experiencing homelessness from three sites in Boston. Each interview was 45-60 minutes in length, audio-recorded, and fully transcribed with accompanying field notes. Analysis was conducted through immersion and crystallization, an iterative process in which the original data was organized and interpreted to articulate patterns and themes. The research team regularly compared and discussed emerging themes in order to strengthen the analysis. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was reached. All notes, reports, codes, and documents were gathered to form an audit trail of the data. Result(s): Participants often cited shelters as the first point of contact for EI services, and caregivers attributed entering shelter as a facilitator for initial access to EI. While facilitating access, the shelter environment also created barriers to effective service engagement. These included limited available physical space, loss of care continuity amidst frequent relocations, and challenges with trust due to feelings of stigma and loss of autonomy. EI providers were a crucial bridge to mitigate these challenges, but were often insufficient to overcome structural barriers important to care. Effective EI strategies included flexibility in accommodating shifting schedules, provisions of socioemotional support in times of stress, and providing warm handoffs to additional upstream resources. Conclusion(s): While EI services are an important source of support for families experiencing homelessness, caregivers experiencing homelessness describe several barriers to engaging in optimal care. Efforts to mitigate shelter-related challenges will require interdisciplinary collaboration between early interventionists and shelter staff at both local and state levels. Further efforts should focus on providing increased engagement and continuity of care for children in a manner that acknowledges the structural barriers of homelessness and supports caregiver autonomy.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Homelessness is a significant public health concern in the United States and is an important risk factor for poor health outcomes. There is limited data regarding the hospital utilization by this vulnerable population, especially inmanaged care settings. Historically, it has been difficult to identify patients experiencing homelessness at the population health level. In 2019, due to the passage of state law SB1152, hospitals across California now need standardized documentation policies for patients experiencing homelessness. This study assessed hospital readmission rates among hospitalized patients experiencing homelessness as identified through documentation in the electronic health record (EHR) as compared to the general hospitalized population within a large integrated health system. METHOD(S): This was a retrospective cohort study following adult patients (age>=18 years) hospitalized in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Medical Centers between 1/1/2019 through 12/1/2020. Patients were identified as homeless or housing insecure if they had SB1152 documentation, a homeless diagnosis code, or address history indicating homelessness within the extensive integrated KPNC EHR. A control group was created using 1:2 propensity score matching using Elixhauser comorbidities and demographics. Sensitivity analyses were performed to compare patients with an index hospitalization occurring during the COVID-19 shelter-in-place period between March 2020 and December 2020 with those whose index hospitalization occurred before this period. The primary outcome was 30-day readmission rate to the hospital or ED, and secondary outcomes included length of index hospitalization, and time to inpatient (IP) readmission. RESULT(S): A total of 12,909 patients were included with 4,303 patients in the homeless group. Patients experiencing homelessness had increased odds for any 30-day readmission (OR 1.59; 95% CI: 1.44-1.76), for inpatient readmission (OR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.17-1.57), for ED readmission (OR 1.63; 95% CI: 1.47-1.80), and had longer stays during their index hospitalization (IRR 1.12; 95% CI: 1.04-1.21). The COVID-19 shelter-in-place period was not associated with any changes in the primary or secondary outcomes studied. CONCLUSION(S): Patients experiencing homelessness are at an increased risk for readmissions and longer hospitalizations compared to the general hospitalized population. Documentation of housing status following SB1152 has improved the ability to study hospital utilization among patients experiencing homelessness. Understanding patterns of hospital utilization in this vulnerable group will help providers to identify timely points of intervention for further social and healthcare support.

N2  - Background/Significance: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) impacts 15 million Americans leading to 5 million annual emergency department (ED) visits and 2 million admissions (White et al., 2018). Hospitalization is a vital opportunity to intervene, and two pharmacologic interventions given before discharge may be effective at reducing re-admissions. Little is known about the AUD population willing and able to be randomized in this setting. Method(s): Our open-label, pilot trial (target n=45-60) randomizes participants to 1) extended-release naltrexone injection, 2) intravenous ketamine infusion, or 3) enhanced-linkage alone. Adult, hospitalized participants with severe AUD and at least one past-year admission are recruited through addiction consultation at an urban, safety-net hospital. Demographics, adverse childhood experiences (ACE), Timeline Follow Back drinking history (TLFB), and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) are recorded at baseline. For this abstract, we present participant characteristics and explore correlations (Pearson r coefficient) between multiple scales of interest and hospital utilization. IRB approval obtained. Result(s): Among 32 complete participants, demographics are: mean age 45, 75% male, 56.25% Caucasian, 34.4% not stably housed. They on average had 13 past-year ED visits, with 5 hospitalizations. Clinical characteristic means are: 12.14 daily drinks, PHQ-9 score 13.2 (of 27), ACE score 4.16 (of 10), and DSM5 criteria total 9.5 (of 11) for AUD. Daily drinks was significantly correlated with hospitalizations (r = 0.517, p=0.0029) as well as ED visits (r = 0.372, p=0.039). ED utilization was also significantly higher for homeless/unstably housed individuals vs stably housed individuals (t(28)= 4.025, p=0.00039). Discussion(s): This safety-net hospital, AUD-research population is high acuity regarding addiction/psychiatric state, housing status, and hospital utilization. Modest correlations observed between daily drinks and depression symptoms with acute care utilization, respectively, are limited by sample size. This population differs from other studies involving ketamine and naltrexone for AUD. For example, in Dakwar et al. (2019), ketamine participants consumed 6.6 daily drinks and had minimal depressive symptoms. In Bryson et al. (2011), XR naltrexone patients had 0.75 ED visits per half-year. Conclusion(s): Trial recruitment appears feasible among a unique, high-utilization sample of hospitalized patients with AUD. Trial results may expand the inpatient toolkit of treatments for this pervasive disease. References: 1. Bryson WC, McConnell KJ, Korthuis PT, et al (2011).

Additionally, as the outreach sessions were only for three months the facilitation of support with professional referral into clinical services. Methods Nurse delivered testing and treatment, contraception including SDI in a monthly outreach session supported by the key worker hostel staff to advertise and promote in the hostel. Following the 3 months the partnership working continued with a direct booking system to the admin outreach staff for the hostel staff Results In total 15 young people were seen in the three sessions. 5/15 were new to sexual health services and 10/15 had accessed sexual health before.4/15 were referred to mainstream services due to symptoms/needs.11/15 were supported in outreach Service user feedback from F2F hostel: 'I wouldn't have bothered going to a service, it was only because it was here'. It was nice not to have to make an effort to get treatment; not sure if I would have done otherwise'. 'The nurse was so friendly, I didn't feel judged'. 'I would have been too embarrassed to go to a clinic'. 'I didn't know I was at risk' After the session 12 were supported into clinical services with direct booking which included 2 IUD fits See attached results for further information Discussion Whilst acknowledging the importance of outreach work to facilitate and support sexual health care this approach demonstrated the impact of professional engagement and pathways. This approach enabled easier access into clinical services for a vulnerable group To offer a contraception and sexually transmitted infection testing outreach service to young people in a homeless hostel.

N2  - Homeless emerging adults ages 18-25 exhibit high rates of alcohol use, as well as sexual behaviors that increase their risk of HIV, STDs and unwanted pregnancy. Yet few risk reduction programs exist for this population, particularly ones that are both effective and can be easily incorporated into settings serving this population (e.g., shelters, drop-in centers). This study addresses an important gap in prevention services for emerging adults experiencing homelessness by conducting a cluster crossover randomized controlled trial of AWARE, an innovative group-MI (Motivational Interviewing) brief risk reduction intervention focusing on both alcohol use and sexual risk behavior. AWARE consists of four 45-minute sessions. Rolling admission is used so that youth can join the program at any time, regardless of session. The evaluation took place at three drop-in centers for 18-25 year olds experiencing homelessness in the Los Angeles area. Participants received the AWARE program (n = 132) or usual care (n = 144). Overall, the sample is predominantly male (70.3%), heterosexual (57.4%), and non-White (83.6%). Surveys were completed at baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-baseline. The 12-month follow-up rate for the sample was 87%. Program satisfaction was high and about one-third (31%) of AWARE participants completed all four sessions. AWARE participants showed significant declines over the 12 month period in their past month frequency of drinking, frequency of heavy drinking, number of drinks on drinking days, and alcohol consequences, as well as significant increase in their use of drinking protective behaviors. Control group participants did not show a significant change in any of these alcohol-related outcomes (all ps > 0.05). Among participants who reported casual partners at both baseline and 12-month surveys (n = 32), exploratory analyses found that AWARE participants had a noticeable, though non-significant decline in unprotected sex with casual partners (d = 0.24), whereas there was virtually no change for control participants. Results indicate that a brief MI-focused risk reduction program, AWARE, is effective in helping emerging adults experiencing homelessness to make positive changes in their alcohol use over a one-year period. Further, results suggest that it may also be effective in reducing unprotected sex with casual partners.

N2  - Methods: We used the ADAPT-ITT (Assessment, Decisions, Administration, Production, Topical experts, Integration, Training staff, and Testing) framework to adapt .b to a youth serving shelter. Methods used include carrying out focus group discussions (n=56), key informant interviews (n=12), and youth working groups (n=10) to identify needed modifications and beta testing those changes with the target audience. Result(s): Adaptations to the curriculum and delivery modality were made to approximate the average length of stay in the shelter; integrate trauma-informed approaches; increase diversity of race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and gender identity among images; and increase the relevance of the audio-visual components. Background(s): Youth experiencing homelessness face emotional and psychological challenges that impact their physical, mental, and social wellbeing, emotion regulation, and coping. Despite the disparity in health outcomes compared to housed peers, they remain underserved. Mindfulness reduces stress and improves resilience, emotion regulation, and executive functioning. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) teach the practice of mindfulness to foster present-moment attention without judgement and enhance self-observation and self-regulation, resulting in greater awareness of thoughts and emotions and improved interpersonal relationships. Importantly, MBIs have been found to improve affect and executive functioning across populations. One such intervention is .b, which was found to lower stress among 522 housed youth aged 12-16 years old. A pilot study of .b among sheltered youth found the intervention to be feasible in this population. Yet the results suggest that important modifications are needed to improve its relevance and accessibility and ensure a trauma-informed approach. Conclusion(s): Youth and the health and social services providers who care for youth generally gave positive feedback regarding the core concepts and presentation of the curriculum. Minor, yet important, changes were needed to increase the relevance, acceptability, and feasibility of the intervention. Our next steps are to conduct a randomized attention control pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability.

N2  - Background: Intestinal failure (IF) is the inability to maintain growth and development in children without the need for intravenous support. Often arising at or shortly after birth, it has both an acute and a chronic phase in its clinical evolution and is a significant stressor on families of affected children. We have observed that supporting a child with IF appears to have a significant impact on family structure, which in turn affects the child. We conducted a retrospective chart review of a cohort of children with IF to determine possible correlations between changes in family structure and clinical outcomes. Method(s): We studied a cohort of patients initially presenting to our Intestinal Rehabilitation Program (IRP) between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016 who then had subsequent five-year follow up. We collected basic demographic and clinical information about subjects at presentation and at subsequent six-month intervals. We identified parent relationship status and caregivers in the household at presentation and characterized their relationships at the same six-month intervals. We defined family structure by those residing in the household and describe combinations of biological parents, non-biological parents, grandparents, and non-biological parents or family. We defined relationships and households with any changes as unstable and those without changes as stable . Result(s): A total of 30 patients were identified and followed for the study. Presenting demographic and clinical data are presented in Table I. All children followed a stable growth curve for height and weight over the course of the study. The summary of our analysis of family structure and parenteral support (PS) data is presented graphically in Figure I. Of the 11 families deemed to be unstable, 5 [45%] remained on PS at the end of the study versus 5/19 [26%] of stable families. This difference did not reach statistical significance (p< 0.05) by Fisher's exact test. Conclusion(s): While changes in relationship status did not absolutely determine PS outcome, a higher percentage of those from unstable households were still on parenteral nutrition by the end of the study compared with those in stable households. Failure to meet statistical significance may be the result of sample size. Families of children with IF experience increased stress which can put strain on relationships; this may impact a child's health outcome. From our data, there appears to be a relationship between family stability and clinical outcome, but because of the retrospective nature of our study, we cannot determine causation, only association. Being aware of this association might direct IRPs to support family structure to improve clinical outcomes. Future work will expand the numbers in the experimental cohort to further evaluate the differences we observed.

N2  - Background: Mothers diagnosed with cancer and their children experience significant distress. Enhancing Connections (EC) is a cancer parenting program that improves outcomes in mother and child by adding to the mother's self-care and parenting skills. Validated with non-Hispanic White mothers of upper socioeconomic status (SES), EC was culturally adapted to serve low SES Latina mothers diagnosed with cancer and their children and renamed Conexiones. Purpose(s): This study tested the short-term impact of the Conexiones program on depressed mood, anxiety, and parenting competencies among diagnosed Latina mothers, and their children's behavioral-emotional adjustment to her cancer. It also examined the feasibility of delivering the telephone-based Conexiones program. Method(s): Eligibility criteria included being a Latina woman diagnosed with early-stage cancer of any type (stages 0-III; excluded some skin cancers) in the last two years with a dependent child 5-17-years-old. Mothers received 5 Conexiones sessions at two-week intervals in her preferred language. Outcome measures assessed the mother's anxiety/depression and parenting skills, self-efficacy, and quality. Anxiety/depression and behavioral problems for her child were also measured. Participants completed all self-reported assessments at baseline and three months post-baseline. The paired within-group comparison of change from baseline to three-month-post-baseline used the Wilcoxon non-parametric p-value. Result(s): Fifteen mothers completed all five education sessions and the 3-month follow-up survey. Mothers were diagnosed with breast, thyroid, and gynecologic cancers. Analysis revealed statistically significant increases in parenting self-efficacy and parenting quality (all p values < 0.05). Marginally significant improvements in maternal mood were also found (p = 0.09). Changes in maternal anxiety and the child's behavioral and psychosocial adjustment also appeared to improve, although they did not approximate statistical significance, possibly due to an underpowered analysis. Regarding feasibility, a review of audio-recorded intervention sessions revealed high dosage and fidelity. Participants were able to complete the telephone sessions and homework in between sessions and reported liking and benefiting from the program in an exit interview. A participant reported multifaceted burdens (e.g., homelessness; domestic abuse; loss of health coverage) in addition to her cancer requiring the development of new study protocols. Conclusion(s): In addition to demonstrating positive preliminary psychosocial outcomes for diagnosed Latina mothers, the pilot study was instrumental in directing further refinement of the Conexiones program, expanding the program's cancer resource booklet with social services needed by low SES Latina survivors, and helping NMSU establish the research infrastructure needed to complete a more rigorous clinical trial.

T1  - Status, Challenges, Practices and Policies Addressing the Conditions of Street Children in Eastern Visayas, Philippines: Basis for a Proposed Intervention Plan
A1  - Pangilinan J.R. 
Y1  - 2022//
N2  - This mixed methods study steered to find out solutions to the problems posed by the existence of street children in Eastern Visayas. Thirty street children were purposively selected who filled out the questionnaire. An interview was also employed to survey feedback among CSWDOs on the extent of programs and projects administered by their respective offices. Results of the study disclosed that majority of the street children are categorized as "children on the street". Moreover, the results identified the predisposing factors that contributed to the occurrence of street children in their localities. The participants observed that these street children perform various activities aside from just roaming in the streets. In terms of program implementation, the results disclosed that LGUs implement measures in collaboration with other appropriate agencies and authorities to address the current situation of their locality on street children. Majority mentioned the enforcement of certain ordinances and local policies to remedy the problems associated to street children. Based on the findings and conclusions of the study, the following recommendations are offered: (1) Transparency report in the real situation analysis, current demographic and economic profile of the street children. (2) Continuous monitoring if the street children are enrolled in formal education. (3) Strengthen and assess non-formal education to the street children to have the privilege to instruction on the premise of balance, opportunity and without separation on any grounds, education must be accessible for all, available to and comprehensive to all children. Further, appropriate funding, monitoring, and sustainability of supporting programs should also be sought for those street children for them to benefit with it.Copyright © 2022, Anka Publishers.

T1  - Initiation into the street, challenges, means of survival and perceived strategies to prevent plights among street children in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia 2019: A phenomenological study design
A1  - Chimdessa A. 
Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Background The life and health of street children are becoming a global concern. Push and pull factors i.e. poverty, family death, economic decline, child abuse, financial independence, and peer influence draw children into the street. The street lives by itself pushes them into sex work, and lack of shelter magnificent abuses, where both sexes have the same sleeping quarters. Materials and Methods A phenomenological study design was employed from January to March 2019 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Time-Space Sampling (TSS) was used to recruit participants into the study. Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and individual in-depth interview were used to collect data. Data analyzed by using framework analysis software. Results About 103 participants took part in the study. Finding shows street children are encountering widespread challenges like social network fragmentation, child trafficking, harassments, and shortage of basic needs. Furthermore, poor design of comprehensive, contextualized strategies and less political value worsening the problems. They are considered as a felon, outlaws, and having a mentality of committing a crime by both law-keeping bodies and society. This situation resulted in fewer acceptances of street children by the community, and less legal protection by law that made them more at risk for denial of social protection. Street children positively perceived strategies like Income Generating Activities (IGAs), shelter, community support, child protection, and access to education, health services, life coaching, and less extent re-integration strategies to address their problems. Conclusion The study shows street children are defenseless to harassments and denial of social protection services. Poorly designed policies, strategies targeting them, less political values, and traditional response by government has been subjugated, which made them prone to health and social problems. Therefore, finding might be beneficial to health data scientists, and policymakers; to design and implement policies, and strategic plans in addressing, and preventing their plights.Copyright © 2022 Ayana Chimdessa.

N2  - Background: Compared to the effects of stress on hunger, the temporal effect of hunger on stress levels is less understood, especially in the context of everyday lives of vulnerable populations with unstable access to food. Objective(s): Our objective was to examine the effects of food insecurity and momentary hunger on momentary stress and stress variability in a sample of currently and formerly homeless young adults. Method(s): We used a 7-day ecological momentary assessment study querying affect, hunger, and risky behaviors. A mixed-effects location scale model was used to examine the effects of hunger on mean levels and within and between-subjects variability of stress with 100 currently homeless and 69 formerly homeless young adults ages 18-29 in Los Angeles County, California. Result(s): When individuals experienced greater-than-average hunger, they then experienced greater stress variability at the next prompt, showing the impact of hunger on stress at the momentary level. Those with higher average levels of stress, regardless of hunger, became substantially more stressed when becoming hungry compared to their generally less stressed counterparts. Conclusion(s): The study shows the extent to which food insecurity results in erratic stress among vulnerable populations and how high levels of hunger may lead to a more inconsistent stress response. Findings reinforce the need for more mental health services and food programs for young adults who have experienced homelessness.Copyright © 2022. American Psychological Association

N2  - Introduction: Young adults experiencing homelessness have poorer overall health compared with the general population. However, not much is known about how health care needs may change in the transition from homelessness to supportive housing. This study utilizes the Gelberg-Andersen Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations to examine unmet health care needs among young adults currently experiencing homelessness and formerly homeless young adults living in supportive housing. Method(s): This study includes data from 192 young adults who were either residing in a supportive housing program (n=103) or were "unhoused" (eg, residing on the street, staying in emergency shelters; n=89) in Los Angeles, CA, between 2017 and 2019. Hierarchical modeling examined unmet health care needs and factors that may enable those needs to be met, controlling for predisposing and other need factors. Result(s): Controlling for predisposing and other need characteristics, this study identified increased enabling factors among those residing in supportive housing, the most widely applied intervention for homelessness. Participants who resided in supportive housing were more likely to report at least 1 type of unmet need than youth who did not have access to housing. Additional findings regarding the association of enabling factors and unmet need yield mixed results based on the type of unmet need. Discussion(s): The acknowledgment of unmet needs may, in fact, be a byproduct of shifting priorities, which often occurs in the transition from homelessness to housing. Understanding the unmet need and health implications of this transition has relevance for practice as we work to better support formerly homeless young adults in meeting the needs that they identify.Copyright © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Homeless refugee youth experience high rates of traumatic and adverse experiences, a significant burden of mental health needs, and compounded barriers in accessing support services. Despite this, there is a paucity of literature exploring the unique intersections and vulnerabilities faced by this subgroup. This study of Youth Without Shelter (YWS), an emergency residence and referral agency serving homeless youth in Toronto, Canada was a qualitative study of homeless refugee youth. Research goals were to describe the mental health needs and identify the factors contributing to the resiliency of refugee youth experiencing homelessness. Data was collected through individual semi-structured interviews with YWS youth (n = 6) and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis with a realist lens. Results highlighted that the mental health of refugee youth experiencing homelessness was subject to system-level factors such as the immigration process (n = 6), housing insecurity (n = 5), finances (n = 5), education (n = 6), employment (n = 6) and sense of safety (n = 4), with acculturative stress, including culture shock (n = 3) and language (n = 4), also have negative effects. Goal directedness (n = 5), independence or responsibility (n = 4), and nurturing social connectedness with family (n = 5), peers (n = 6), and community (n = 4) contributed to participants' resilience. A model for planning future interventions was proposed and was informed by the lived experience of participants. This model focuses on initially on immediate and basic needs and reflected evidence gathered through this work to attend to long-term needs once individuals have integrated into society. Future efforts will be directed toward translating the lived experience of this population and developing practice guidelines to optimize care.Copyright © 2022 Khan, Waserman and Patel.

N2  - Background: Dietary diversity is generally considered as a good indicator of nutrient adequacy and is influenced by various factors at the national, household, and individual levels. Objective(s): The present study sought to determine the relationships between household food insecurity, primary caregivers' nutrition knowledge, and dietary diversity of school-aged children in Ghana. Method(s): This forms part of a longitudinal study conducted in the Ayawaso West Municipal district in Accra (urban setting) and the Upper Manya Krobo district (rural setting) in Ghana. Data were collected from a total of 116 caregiver-child dyads using 24-h dietary recall and a short version of the US 12-month Household Food Security Survey Module. Nutrition knowledge and sociodemographic data were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression was used to check for factors associated with children's dietary diversity. Result(s): Majority of households reported food insecurity, with a higher percentage of insecure households located in the rural area (88.9% vs. 46.5%, P <= 0.0001), compared to the urban setting. Diet diversity among the study children was low, with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) of 5.8 (2.1) out of 14 food groups. Children living in food insecure households were three times more likely to have received low diverse diet compared to those from food secure households (adjusted odds ratio [OR] =3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-8.0). Caregivers' nutrition knowledge was, however, not related to children's dietary diversity. Discussion and conclusion: Household food insecurity was a main predictor of dietary diversity among school-age children in this study. Thus, caregiver knowledge in nutrition may not be enough, particularly in the presence of food insecurity to guarantee adequate nutrition for school-aged children.Copyright © 2022 Anet Antwi et al.

N2  - AIM: To assess the effectiveness of supported employment interventions for improving competitive employment in populations of people with conditions other than only severe mental illness. BACKGROUND: Supported employment interventions have been extensively tested in severe mental illness populations. These approaches may be beneficial outside of these populations. METHOD(S): We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Scopus, JSTOR, PEDro, OTSeeker, and NIOSHTIC for trials including unemployed people with any condition and including severe mental illness if combined with other co-morbidities or other specific circumstances (e.g., homelessness). We excluded trials where inclusion was based on severe mental illness alone. Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias (RoB v2.0) and four reviewers extracted data. We assessed rates of competitive employment as compared to traditional vocational rehabilitation or waiting list/services as usual. FINDINGS: Ten randomised controlled trials (913 participants) were included. Supported employment was more effective than control interventions for improving competitive employment in seven trials: in people with affective disorders [risk ratio (RR) 10.61 (1.49, 75.38)]; mental disorders and justice involvement [RR 4.44 (1.36,14.46)]; veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [RR 2.73 (1.64, 4.54)]; formerly incarcerated veterans [RR 2.17 (1.09, 4.33)]; people receiving methadone treatment [RR 11.5 (1.62, 81.8)]; veterans with spinal cord injury at 12 months [RR 2.46 (1.16, 5.22)] and at 24 months [RR 2.81 (1.98, 7.37)]; and young people not in employment, education, or training [RR 5.90 (1.91-18.19)]. Three trials did not show significant benefits from supported employment: populations of workers with musculoskeletal injuries [RR 1.38 (1.00, 1.89)]; substance abuse [RR 1.85 (0.65, 5.41)]; and formerly homeless people with mental illness [RR 1.55 (0.76, 3.15)]. Supported employment interventions may be beneficial to people from more diverse populations than those with severe mental illness alone. Defining competitive employment and increasing (and standardising) measurement of non-vocational outcomes may help to improve research in this area.

N2  - Background: Adolescent and young women (10-24 years old) are habitually a neglected group in humanitarian settings. Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) is an unmet aspect of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and an additional challenge if lack of hygiene products, inadequate access to safe, clean, and private toilets identified as period poverty. Our objective was to provide an overview of the main MHM issues affecting Venezuelan migrant adolescents and young women in the north-western border of Venezuela-Brazil. Method(s): A cross-sectional study was conducted, early in 2021, with the use of a self-responded questionnaire, in Spanish, adapted from the Menstrual Practice Needs Scale (MPNS-36). All identified adolescents and young women aged between 12 and 24 years old were invited to participate (convenience sample-167 women). Women with complete questionnaires and who menstruate were included. Information on access to and quality of hygiene kits and toilets were retrieved, and a descriptive analysis performed, with an evaluation of frequencies for categorical variables (n, %) and mean (+/- SD-standard deviation) for continuous variables. In addition to the open-ended questions, we included one open question about their personal experience with menstruation. Result(s): According to official reports, at the moment of the interviews, there were 1.603 Venezuelans living on the streets in Boa Vista. A total of 167 young women were invited, and 142 further included, mean age was 17.7 years, almost half of the participants who menstruate (46.4%) did not receive any hygiene kits, 61% were not able to wash their hands whenever they wanted, and the majority (75.9%) did not feel safe to use the toilets. Further, menstruation was often described with negative words. Conclusion(s): Migrant Venezuelan adolescents and young women have their MHM needs overlooked, with evident period poverty, and require urgent attention. It is necessary to assure appropriate menstrual materials, education, and sanitation facilities, working in partnership among governmental and non-governmental organizations to guarantee menstrual dignity to these young women.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Because of the high prevalence and serious complications of malnutrition in children, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the association of malnutrition in children with food and nutrition insecurity in Fars Province, Iran. Method(s): In this case-control study, all 6-60-month-old children living in Fars Province in 2015 and their weight for age cures were below the third percentile, were included as the malnourished group (case group). Also, 1000 sex-and age-matched children without any growth retardations were selected as the well-nourished group (control group). The children's food and nutrition insecurity was evaluated using a questionnaire consisting of the child's feeding, household sanitation status, and food security, besides maternal knowledge and practice about child nutrition. Finally, the food insecurity status of the two groups was compared. Result(s): Based on the findings, 943 (47.1%) children lived in food-insecure households, with a higher percentage of malnourished children than well-nourished ones (57.8% vs. 36.5%; P < 0.001). The probability of malnutrition in the children with full time working fathers was half of those with unemployed fathers (OR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.38-0.83). Malnutrition in children was significantly associated with their birth weight (P < 0.001), maternal body mass index (P < 0.001), maternal knowledge and practice about child feeding (P < 0.001 for both), and having sanitary latrines at home as an indicator of household sanitary status (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Malnutrition in children had significant associations with many aspects of food and nutrition insecurity. To decrease the prevalence of malnutrition, health systems, and other organizations should design policies to improve food insecurity, especially those focusing on family education and nutritional support for low socioeconomic families.Copyright © 2021, Kowsar Medical Institute.

N2  - Objective: Many adolescents and young adults receiving substance use treatment have experienced or are at risk for homelessness. It is unknown whether specific treatment approaches are more or less effective for youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) compared to stably housed youth. The present study compared the effectiveness of the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach, Motivational Enhancement Therapy combined with Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT), and Treatment as Usual (TAU) for these two groups. Further subgroup differences were investigated by age, sex, and sexual and gender minority status. Method(s): YEH (n = 855) and a matched sample of stably housed youth (n = 855) were drawn from the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs, a nationwide substance use treatment data set. Multiple-group latent change score modeling was used to examine change in substance use frequency and related problems at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Result(s): Results indicated significant declines in substance use frequency and problems during treatment for all intervention groups. The TAU group showed the greatest declines in substance use problems during treatment and the greatest declines in frequency post-treatment. Compared to stably housed youth, YEH entered treatment with greater substance use and problems, and had greater declines in substance use in the MET/CBT group only. Other differences were found by age and sex. Conclusion(s): Overall, all three substance use interventions appear to be effective in reducing substance use and related problems. TAU and MET/CBT may be particularly effective for YEH in treatment settings. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.Copyright © 2021 American Psychological Association

N2  - This study aimed to identify effective strategies for improving the uptake of influenza vaccination and to inform recommendations for influenza vaccination programs in Australia. A rapid systematic review was conducted to assimilate and synthesize peer-reviewed articles identified in PubMed. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Hierarchy of Evidence was used to appraise the quality of evidence. A systematic search identified 4373 articles and 52 that met the inclusion criteria were included. The evidence suggests influenza vaccination uptake may be improved by interventions that (1) increase community/patient demand and access to influenza vaccine and overcome practice-related barriers; (2) reinforce the critical role healthcare providers play in driving influenza vaccination uptake. Strategies such as standing orders, reminder and recall efforts were successful in improving influenza vaccination rates. Community pharmacies, particularly in regional/remote areas, are well positioned to improve influenza vaccine coverage. The findings of this rapid review can be utilized to improve the performance of influenza immunization programs in Australia and other countries with comparable programs; and recommend priorities for future evaluation of interventions to improve influenza vaccination uptake.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Ensuring young people experience good sexual health is a key public health concern, yet some vulnerable groups of young people remain at higher risk of poor sexual health. These individuals require additional support to achieve good sexual health but the best way to provide this remains needs to be better understood. Method(s): We searched for randomised controlled trials of behavioural and psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting sexual health in high-risk young populations. Outcomes of interest were indicators of sexual health (e.g., condom use, attitudes to contraception, knowledge of risk). Participants were under 25 years old and in one of the following high-risk groups: alcohol and other drug use; ethnic minority; homeless; justice-involved; LGBTQI+; mental ill-health; or out-of-home care. Result(s): Twenty-eight papers from 26 trials met our inclusion criteria, with all but one conducted in North America. Condom use was the most frequently reported outcome measure along with knowledge and attitudes towards sexual health but considerable differences in measures used made comparisons across studies difficult. Change in knowledge and attitudes did not consistently result in long-term change in behaviours. Conclu-sions: There remains a dearth of research undertaken outside of North America across all high-risk groups of young people. Future interventions should address sexual health more broadly than just the absence of negative biological outcomes, with LGBTQI+, homeless and mental ill-health populations targeted for such work. An international consensus on outcome measures would support the research field going forward, making future meta-analyses possible.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Introduction: Mental health and substance use disorder (MHSUD) patients in the emergency department (ED) have been facing increasing lengths of stay due to a shortage of inpatient beds. Previous research indicates mobile crisis outreach (MCO) reduces long ED stays for MHSUD patients. Our objective was to assess the impact of MCO contact on future ED utilization. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients presenting to a large Midwest university ED with an MHSUD chief complaint from 2015-2018. We defined the exposure as those who had MCO contact and any MHSUD-related ED visit within 30 days of MCO contact. The MCO patients were 2:1 propensity score-matched by demographic data and comorbidities matched to patients with no MCO contact. Outcomes were all-cause and psychiatric-specific reasons for return to the ED within one year of the index ED visit. We report descriptive statistics and odds ratios (OR) to describe the difference between the two groups, and hazard ratios (HR) to estimate the risk of return ED visit. Result(s): The final sample included 106 MCO and 196 non-MCO patients. The MCO patients were more likely to be homeless (OR 14.8; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.87, 117), less likely to have adequate family or social support (OR 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31, 0.84), and less likely to have a hospital bed requested for them in the index visit by ED providers (OR 0.50; 95% CI, 0.29, 0.88). For those who returned to the ED, the median time for all-cause return to the ED was 28 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 6-93 days) for the MCO patients and 88 days (IQR: 20-164 days) for non-MCO patients. The risk of all-cause return to the ED was greater among MCO patients (67%) compared to non-MCO patients (49%) (adjusted HR: 1.66; 95% CI, 1.22, 2.27). Conclusion(s): The MCO patients had less family and social support; however, they were less likely to require hospitalization for each visit, likely due to MCO involvement. Patients with MCO contact presented to the ED more frequently than non-MCO patients, which implies a strong linkage between the ED and MCO in our community. An effective referral to community service from the ED and MCO and collaboration could be the next step to improve healthcare utilization.Copyright: © 2021 Vakkalanka et al.

N2  - Young adults experiencing homelessness are at high risk of opioid and other substance use, poor mental health outcomes, exposure to trauma, and other risks. Providing access to stable housing has the potential to act as a powerful preventive intervention, but supportive housing programs have been studied most often among chronically homeless adults or adults with serious mental illness. The Housing First model, which does not precondition supportive housing on sobriety, may reduce drug use in homeless adults. In the present study, we piloted an adapted model of Housing First plus prevention services that was tailored to the needs of young adults (18-24 years) experiencing homelessness in the USA. Preventive services were added to the Housing First model and included youth-centered advocacy services, motivational interviewing, and HIV risk prevention services. This model was piloted in a single-arm study (n = 21) to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of a Housing First model over a 6-month period in preparation for a larger randomized trial. We use repeated measures ANOVA to test for changes in alcohol and drug use (percent days of use; alcohol or drug use consequences), housing stability, social network support, and cognitive distortions over 6 months of follow-up. A total of 17 youth completed the study (85% retention), and a high proportion of youth were stably housed at 6-month follow-up. Participation in intervention services was high with an average of 13.57 sessions for advocacy, 1.33 for MI, and 0.76 for HIV prevention. Alcohol use did not change significantly over time. However, drug use, drug use consequences, and cognitive distortions, and the size of youths' social networks that were drug using individuals decreased significantly. The Housing First model appeared to be feasible to deliver, and youth engaged in the supportive intervention services. The study demonstrates the potential for an adapted Housing First model to be delivered to youth experiencing homelessness and may improve outcomes, opening the way for larger randomized trials of the intervention.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Cognitive distortions are conceptualized as one of the most potent predictors of suicide. However, little is known about the mediating and moderating mechanisms linking cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation. The present study examined a prospective moderated mediation model linking cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation, with drug use, social problem-solving, and perceived burdensomeness as the mediators and childhood sexual abuse as the moderator. Participants included 150 homeless youth who participated in a randomized clinical trial for suicide intervention. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. We analyzed the data using a multiple-group path model. Findings showed that social problem-solving and perceived burdensomeness sequentially mediated the association between cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation regardless of childhood sexual abuse, whereas drug use mediated the association between cognitive distortions and suicidal ideation only among youth reporting no history of sexual abuse. Findings highlight how coping processes, both adaptive and maladaptive, operate differently to predict suicidal ideation contingent on the effects of childhood sexual abuse in the context of cognitive distortions. Findings also underscore the importance of addressing the effects of childhood abuse to facilitate the efficiency of interventions that seek to reduce suicidal ideation among a vulnerable population.

N2  - Evidence from demographic and health surveys in various countries and Ethiopia too showed that more women are generally believed to justify intimate partner violence (IPV) than men do. An attitude that justifies IPV is one of the factors affecting victimization and perpetration from IPV. However, women's justification about the violence and factors affecting the justification are not well documented, particularly by addressing household factors such as household food conditions. Therefore, the present study aims to fill this gap among married women of childbearing age so that evidence can be drawn for holistic interventions. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 696 currently married women of childbearing age (15-49) by using a multistage cluster sampling technique to obtain the women from 11 kebeles (the smallest administrative unit in the government structure of Ethiopia) of Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia. Data were collected using a pretested and structured questionnaire. Logistic regression was performed using IBM SPSS version 20. The odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval was used to show the degree of association between the outcome variable and explanatory variables. Nearly two-thirds (59.5%) of the study women justified wife-beating in at least one of the five conditions. A higher odds of justification of wife-beating was observed among women whose marriage was arranged by any other person than the couples themselves, from food-insecure households, with a family size of 5 and above, in the age group of 30-39 years, and whose partner was in the age range of 31-39 years. In contrast, lower odds of justification of wife-beating was observed among women having an age difference of 10 or more years with their partner and those in a household wealth index of middle and higher category. Despite great efforts in realizing gender equality in the country, a higher proportion of women were having the attitude that justifies wife-beating in the five conditions specified to them. Interventions targeting the improvement of women's attitude towards wife-beating should target against the traditional norms of arranged marriage, improve household food conditions, and decrease family size.

N2  - Background: Relative to their counterparts in the general population, young people who leave, or transition out of, out-of-home (OOHC) arrangements commonly experience poorer outcomes across a range of indicators, including higher rates of homelessness, unemployment, reliance on public assistance, physical and mental health problems and contact with the criminal justice system. The age at which young people transition from OOHC varies between and within some countries, but for most, formal support ceases between the ages of 18 and 21. Programs designed to support transitions are generally available to young people toward the end of their OOHC placement, although some can extend beyond. They often encourage the development of skills required for continued engagement in education, obtaining employment, maintaining housing and general life skills. Little is known about the effectiveness of these programs or of extended care policies that raise the age at which support remains available to young people after leaving OOHC. This systematic review will seek to identify programs and/or interventions that improve outcomes for youth transitioning from the OOHC system into adult living arrangements. Method(s): This review will identify programs, interventions and policies that seek to improve health and wellbeing of this population that have been tested using robust controlled methods. Primary outcomes of interest are homelessness, health, education, employment, exposure to violence and risky behaviour. Secondary outcomes are relationships and life skills. We will search, from January 1990 onwards, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ERIC, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, SocINDEX, Sociological Abstracts, Social Services Abstracts, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and Health Technology Assessment. Grey literature will be identified through searching websites and databases, e.g. clearing houses, government agencies and organisations known to be undertaking or consolidating research on this topic area. Two reviewers will independently screen all title and abstracts and full text articles with conflicts to be resolved by a third reviewer. Data extraction will be undertaken by pairs of review authors, with one reviewer checking the results of the other. If more than one study with suitable data can be identified, we plan to undertake both fixed-effects and random-effects meta-analyses and intend to present the random-effects result if there is no indication of funnel plot asymmetry. Risk of bias will be assessed using tools appropriate to the study methodology. Quality of evidence across studies will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Discussion(s): Previous reviews were unable to identify any programs or interventions, backed by methodologically rigorous research, that improve outcomes for this population. This review seeks to update this previous work, taking into account changes in the provision of extended care, which is now available in some jurisdictions.

N2  - Background: Young adults that experience homelessness (YAEH) are at heightened risk of unplanned pregnancy and contracting STIs, including HIV than their housed counterparts. It is unclear how exiting homelessness into Supportive Housing (SH), the most prominent intervention in homelessness, may shape sexual risk-taking. Objective(s): The goal of this study is to explore associations of condom and contraception use with particular interest in the role of partner type (i.e., casual and/or serious) and housing status. Method(s): This study includes 143 sexually active YAEH (ages 18-27) who reported engaging in vaginal sex during the past three months: 67 "unhoused" (i.e., street-based, couch-surfers, or staying in emergency shelter), and 76 "housed" from SH programs. Multiple logistic regression examined the relationship of housing status and partner type with condom and contraceptive use. Result(s): Being a parent was associated with higher odds of contraceptive use regardless of housing status, while partner type (i.e., serious or casual partner) was differently associated with condom use by housing status. Discussion(s): Despite documented differences in condom-using behaviors by housing status, findings revealed similar patterns in contraceptive use between the two groups, indicating a possible need for enhanced and targeted service planning for YAEH, particularly among those transitioning to and residing in SH, regarding contraceptive use and prevention.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Introduction Since the global financial crises of 2008, there has been a rise in the number of people experiencing food insecurity. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this. Many more are unable to afford or access food of sufficient quality and quantity to enable good health and well-being. Particularly vulnerable are mothers with young children, pregnant women and lone parents (the majority of whom are women). This review aims to understand experiences of food insecurity and how it affects women and children's nutritional health and well-being, focusing on experiences explicitly related to nutrition. Findings will help guide health policy and practice to support food-insecure women and children from high-income countries. Methods and analysis A systematic review and meta-ethnography exploring (1) food-insecure women's own accounts of their nutritional health and (2) food-insecure household's accounts of their children's nutritional health. Six major databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL and ASSIA), grey literature databases and relevant stakeholder websites will be searched from 1 January 2008 to 30 March 2021. Reference list and citation searches will supplement electronic database searches. Outcomes of interest are accounts of nutrition and nutritional health, including diet, food practices, infant feeding practices and physical and mental health. The review will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocol guidelines, but as this is a meta-ethnography it will adhere to eMERGe Reporting Guidance for synthesis and writing findings of the final report. Critical Appraisal Skills Programme qualitative checklist will assess the quality of studies. A meta-ethnographic analysis will be conducted for all included studies. Ethics and dissemination As a qualitative systematic review, without primary data collection, ethical approval will not be required. Findings will be submitted for peer-reviewed publication.

N2  - Background Longitudinal studies examining the life trajectories of young people after they have exited homelessness have identified concerns with persistent social and economic exclusion, struggles to shake off identities of homelessness, and housing instability. This pilot study sought to explore the feasibility of improving socioeconomic inclusion outcomes by bolstering identity capital (sense of purpose and control, self-efficacy and self-esteem) among young people who had experienced homelessness. Methods Nineteen individuals (aged 18-26) who had transitioned out of homelessness within the past three years participated in a six-week, six-session program focused on building identity capital. The study employed a mixed method prospective cohort hybrid design with an intervention group (Group One) and a delayed intervention comparison group (Group Two). Participants were interviewed every three months until nine months post-intervention. Results None of the youth who began the intervention dropped out of the program, with the exception of one participant who moved across the country and was unable to continue. Immediately after participating in the intervention, Group One had statistically significant improvements (p < .05) and large to very large effect sizes in self-esteem (d = 1.16) and physical community integration (d = 1.79) compared to changes in Group Two over the same period, which had not yet begun the intervention. In the pooled analysis, small to moderate effect sizes in hopelessness, physical community integration, and self-esteem were observed at all post-intervention time points. Notably, at six- and nine-months postintervention, statistically significant improvements (p < .05) and moderate effect sizes in hopelessness (d = -0.73 and d = -0.60 respectively) and self-esteem (d = 0.71 and d = 0.53 respectively) were observed. Youth shared they appreciated the normalizing (vs. pathologizing) of strategies they needed to learn and spoke of the importance of framing new skills as something one needs "to have a better life"vs. "to get better."Conclusions These early findings signal that targeting identity capital is feasible and may be a promising approach to incorporate into a more complex intervention that includes housing, education, and employment supports to help youth transition out of homelessness. Future research could build on these findings through a sufficiently powered randomized controlled trial. Copyright © 2021 Thulien et al.

N2  - Purpose: This study evaluated the potential benefit to graduate students' of participating in a service-learning program conducting a storybook reading program for children in a family homeless shelter. Method(s): Ten graduate students in the second year of a two-year master's degree program in communication science and disorders participated in the storybook reading program. The graduate students engaged in reflective writing about their experiences and completed self-ratings of confidence in preliteracy skills before and after program participation. Twenty graduate students in two comparison groups (10 students in a pre-program comparison group, and 10 in a post-program comparison group) also completed questionnaires. The mixed-methods study used quantitative analyses to analyze questionnaire ratings and qualitative methods to analyze reflective writings. Result(s): Together, the quantitative and qualitative results indicated positive outcomes from the service-learning experience with regard to graduate students' perceived confidence in preliteracy skills and preparation for careers as speech-language pathologists. The results provide empirical data showing that service-learning experiences with at-risk populations can contribute to graduate students' clinical education and preparation as speech-language pathologists. Conclusion(s): The results support the value of service-learning experiences in communication sciences and disorders. Clinical preparation in preliteracy development also supports the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association statement on the roles and responsibilities of speech-language pathologists in relation to reading and writing in children.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Violence against women places them in a vulnerable position with regard to homelessness. Although sometimes invisible, women's homelessness is a complex reality shrouded in dramatic biographies that should be sensitively addressed to avoid revictimization. Method(s): With the aim of understanding the chaotic discourse of homeless women's experiences of violence, a qualitative single-case study was conducted using the photo-elicitation technique. Data were analyzed in accordance with grounded theory. Result(s): The participant's discourse could be summarized in the following categories: "Living in a spiral of violence", "Confronting vulnerability and violence", "Being a strong woman", "New family networks", "Re-building mother-child relationships", and "Nurturing spiritual wellbeing". Conclusion(s): Supporting homelessness women requires an approach that focuses on the prevention of re-victimization and the consequences of violence in terms of physical and mental health. Shelters are spaces of care for recovery and represent referential elements for the re-construction of self.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Objectives: Sexual behaviors of homeless youth in Iran have not been well studied. This study aimed to measure the frequency and associated factors of sex out of marriage and condom use among homeless youth in Kerman, Iran. Study design: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 202 homeless youth (age: 15-29 years who experienced 30 or more days of homelessness in the last 12 months) from 11 street locations between September to December 2017. Method(s): Of 202 participants, 169 (83.7%) reported sex in the last 12 months and were include in this analysis. We assessed the prevalence of sex out of marriage in the last 12 months, condom use in last sex, and then evaluated their covariates in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Result(s): The prevalence of sex out of marriage was 19.6% (95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 13.8%, 26.3%) and the prevalence of condom use was 43.8% (95% CI: 36.2%, 51.6%). Sex out of marriage was significantly correlated with male gender (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 24.38; 95% CI: 3.1-192.1) and being unmarried (AOR: 5.94; 95% CI: 2.3-15.5). Condom use was significantly correlated with male gender (AOR: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.1-4.2) and higher educational status (AOR: 4.30; 95% CI: 2.1-8.8). Conclusion(s): Our findings indicate that one in five homeless youth had sex out of marriage, and less than half did no use condom. These should be addressed by adapting education and harm reduction programs targeting this specific population in Iran.Copyright © 2021 The Royal Society for Public Health

N2  - Poverty creates social conditions that increase the likelihood of homelessness. These in-clude exposure to traumatic life experiences; social disadvantages such as poor educational experi-ences; being raised in a broken family, care homes or foster care; physical, emotional, and sexual abuse; and neglect at an early age. These conditions reduce people's ability to negotiate through life challenges. This cross-sectional study documents the clustering and frequency of adverse social conditions among 152 homeless people from four cities in North West England between January and August 2020. Two-step cluster analysis showed that having parents with a criminal record, care history, and child neglect/abuse history was predictive of homelessness. The cluster of indicator variables among homeless people included sexual abuse (chi2 (N = 152) = 220.684, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.7), inappropriate sexual behaviour (chi2 (N = 152) = 207.737, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.7), emotional neglect (chi2 (N = 152) = 181.671, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.7), physical abuse by step-parent (chi2 (N = 152) = 195.882, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.8), and physical neglect (chi2 (N = 152) = 205.632, p < 0.001, Cramer's V = 0.8). Poverty and homelessness are intertwined because of the high prevalence of poverty among the homeless. Poverty sets up a chain of interactions between social conditions that increase the likelihood of unfavourable outcomes: homelessness is at the end of the interaction chain. Interventions supporting families to rise out of poverty may also reduce entry into homelessness.Copyright © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Background: Housing First (HF) is an evidence-based service model that combines permanent housing and supportive case management premised on harm reduction and consumer self-determination to end homelessness for high-need individuals. Originally developed for use with single adults, this model is now being employed with families. Yet there is little empirical work on how HF is implemented with this particular population. Objective(s): The aim of this study is to examine how frontline providers adapt and apply HF to formerly homeless or at-risk, families involved in child welfare. Participants and setting: Frontline providers working in family HF programs (N = 59) were recruited from two states, across 11 organizations, and 16 program sites. The theoretical sample (n = 26) includes 13 participants working in programs that encouraged direct collaboration with Child Protective Services (CPS) in the program model and 13 participants from three non-CPS-aligned sites in a second state. Method(s): A grounded theory approach was used to analyze semi-structured, qualitative interviews. Result(s): Frontline providers exercised street-level bureaucratic discretion when interpreting child protection reporting mandates and they found ways to adapt the HF model to this population. In doing so, they worked to juggle both their mandates to child protection and to principles of HF to create a "child safety-modified" form of HF. Conclusion(s): While our study shows that providers are modifying HF to address the needs of families involved in child welfare, it also raises questions as to the degree to which HF can be done with high fidelity when used with this population.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - BACKGROUND: Homeless youth experience high rates of substance use disorders, exposures to violence, mental and physical health conditions, and mortality. They have been particularly affected by the opioid crisis. However, no study to date has used a randomized controlled design to test preventive interventions of opioid and other drug use among this vulnerable population. Resolution of youth homelessness through housing and supportive services including prevention services, often referred to as "Housing First," has great potential to reduce the likelihood for the development of an opioid use disorder as well as other problem behaviors associated with living on the streets. Housing First has been tested through randomized trials among homeless adults with mental health and substance use disorders, but has not been empirically tested for opioid prevention among homeless youth. METHOD(S): Homeless youth will be recruited from a drop-in shelter site frequented by disconnected youth; they will be screened for eligibility, including current homelessness, age 18-24 years, and not currently meeting criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). In a controlled trial, 240 youth will then be randomized to one of two conditions, (1) housing+opioid and related risk prevention services, or (2) opioid and related risk prevention services alone. This project utilizes existing efficacious models of prevention to address opioid-related risks, including motivational interviewing, strengths-based outreach and advocacy, and an HIV risk preventive intervention. Follow-up will be conducted at 3, 6, 9 and 12-months post-baseline. The economic cost of each intervention will be determined to support implementation decisions with other providers and their funders. DISCUSSION: This study will provide essential information for researchers and providers on the efficacy of housing+opioid and related risk prevention services in an RCT for effects on opioid use and mechanisms underlying change. Because youth experiencing homelessness are at increased risk for a variety of adverse outcomes, the proposed intervention may produce substantial health care benefits to the youths and society at large.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Studies indicate high rates of substance use among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH). Further, the social networks of YEH, although multi-dimensional in composition, are largely comprised of other YEH, substance users, and individuals who do not provide the youth with tangible or emotional support. For YEH who have the opportunity to enter a housing program, helping them to reduce their substance use and strengthen their prosocial supportive connections during this critical transition period may increase their stability and reduce their risk of re-entering homelessness. The goal of this study is to pilot test a brief motivational network intervention (MNI), delivered by case managers, to help former YEH who have recently transitioned to a housing program reduce their substance use and strengthen their prosocial supportive connections. METHODS/DESIGN: Up to 60 residents of housing programs in the Los Angeles area will be randomized to receive four sessions of usual case manager support or four sessions of case manager support+MNI. Each MNI session consists of three parts: (1) identifying two goals that are most important for the resident over the next year (e.g., get or keep a job, finish or stay in school, reduce substance use); (2) a network interview with the resident to capture network data pertaining to their interactions in the past 2 weeks; and (3) a discussion between the case manager and the resident of the resulting network visualizations, conducted in a Motivational Interviewing (MI) style, and what role the resident's network may play in reaching their most important goals over the next year. DISCUSSION: This study addresses a critical gap by pilot testing a computer-assisted MNI, delivered using MI techniques, that can help case managers work with recent YEH to reduce substance use and increase permanent supportive connections during the critical transitional period from homelessness to housing.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Youth experiencing homelessness are at high risk for suicide, yet few studies have evaluated risk reduction interventions targeting suicidal ideation in this vulnerable population. A comprehensive approach to risk-reduction is needed that addresses basic needs and provides targeted interventions for those at highest risk. The protocol described builds on the design of the first randomized trial of Housing First (HF) for homeless youth. The primary objective is to determine whether housing combined with supportive services that include suicide screening and targeted psychotherapy (Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention) is effective for reducing suicidal ideation and other secondary outcomes (depression and suicide attempts). Additionally, we will explore mediators of the treatment effect (housing stability and substance use) and determinants of implementation. METHOD(S): Youth recruited to the HF trial will be randomized to HF+supportive services (n=120), or supportive services alone (n=120). The "Suicide Treatment Education and Prevention" (STEP) protocol will additionally screen youth in both arms at baseline and 3months for suicidal ideation (SSI-W). Those who screen as moderate risk for suicide (SSI-W>=10) will be offered CTSP, which includes up to 9 sessions over the first 6months following enrollment. CTSP will be delivered in one-on-one sessions by a trained advocate. Research assessments will be collected to assess outcomes (including suicidal ideation) at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12months. Qualitative interviews with subjects receiving CTSP and other stakeholders will explore implementation determinants. DISCUSSION: The study will fill an important gap in the literature about the added benefit of HF combined with supportive services including suicide screening and treatment for reducing suicidal ideation in homeless youth. With the urgent need to address both homelessness and suicide risk, evidence is needed about services that can be integrated into delivery settings for youth experiencing homelessness.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Smoking rates are significantly higher among young people experiencing homelessness than in the general population. Despite a willingness to quit, homeless youth have little success in doing so on their own, and existing cessation resources tailored to this population are lacking. Homeless youth generally enjoy the camaraderie and peer support that group-based programs offer, but continuous in-person support during a quit attempt can be prohibitively expensive. OBJECTIVE(S): This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an automated text messaging intervention (TMI) as an adjunct to group-based cessation counseling and provision of nicotine patches to help homeless youth quit smoking. This paper outlines the lessons learned from the implementation of the TMI intervention. METHOD(S): Homeless youth smokers aged 18 to 25 years who were interested in quitting (n=77) were recruited from drop-in centers serving homeless youth in the Los Angeles area. In this pilot randomized controlled trial, all participants received a group-based cessation counseling session and nicotine patches, with 52% (40/77) randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of text messages to provide additional support for their quit attempt. Participants received text messages on their own phone rather than receiving a study-issued phone for the TMI. We analyzed baseline and follow-up survey data as well as back-end data from the messaging platform to gauge the acceptability and feasibility of the TMI among the 40 participants who received it. RESULT(S): Participants had widespread (smart)phone ownership-16.4% (36/219) were ineligible for study participation because they did not have a phone that could receive text messages. Participants experienced interruptions in their phone use (eg, 44% [16/36] changed phone numbers during the follow-up period) but reported being able to receive the majority of messages. These survey results were corroborated by back-end data (from the program used to administer the TMI) showing a message delivery rate of about 95%. Participant feedback points to the importance of carefully crafting text messages, which led to high (typically above 70%) approval of most text messaging components of the intervention. Qualitative feedback indicated that participants enjoyed the group counseling session that preceded the TMI and suggested including more such group elements into the intervention. CONCLUSION(S): The TMI was well accepted and feasible to support smoking cessation among homeless youth. Given high rates of smartphone ownership, the next generation of phone-based smoking cessation interventions for this population should consider using approaches beyond text messages and focus on finding ways to develop effective approaches to include group interaction using remote implementation. Given overall resource constraints and in particular the exigencies of the currently ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, phone-based interventions are a promising approach to support homeless youth, a population urgently in need of effective smoking cessation interventions.

N2  - Lineage 4/X-family of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is not very notorious, except for the CDC1551 strain. One strain of this family, named Ara50, caused one of the largest tuberculosis outbreaks of the Aragon region, Spain, during the 1990s and remained until 2018. These X-strains are characterised by high transmissibility and by carrying a low copy number of IS6110 in their genomes. Epidemiological data of the 61 patients consisted of inmates, HIV seropositives, intravenous drug users and the homeless. The application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to 36 out of 61 isolates, selected by IS6110-RFLP, allowed to confirm 32 as recent transmissions. We found 10 SNPs in genes considered as virulence factors, five of them specific of this strain. WGS identified three sub-clusters (CLSs). The largest one, sub-CLS 1, included 10 cases. Seven of them shared a SNP in the mce3C gene, considered a virulence factor gene. Sub-CLS 2 involved familiar cases, and no link was known for sub-CLS 3. Finally, the strain showed efficacy in latency as a confirmed epidemiological link was established between two cases, with 6 years of distance in their diagnosis. This outbreak study combined epidemiological and molecular analyses in order to elucidate tuberculosis transmission.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Substance use is strongly associated with suicide completions. However, little is known about the patterns of substances used in suicide deaths. The purpose of this analysis is to determine latent classes of toxicology-reported substances among individuals who completed suicide. The sample consists of suicide victims in the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) during years 2003-2017 (n = 202,838). Toxicology reports were used to construct latent class analyses of substance use among suicide victims. Correlates for latent class membership included sex, race/ethnicity, previous experiences of child abuse, homelessness, and intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization. The majority of suicide victims were male (77.7%), straight/heterosexual (99.5%) and white (88.3%). The final unconditional model yielded a four-class model, including a "No substance/single substance use" class, an "Alcohol and other substance" class, a "Marijuana and other substance" class, and an "Opiate use" class. Compared to the reference class of "No substance/single substance," females were more likely than males to be classified in the "Alcohol and other substance" class, the "Multi-substance use" class, and the "Opiate use" class. Homelessness was associated with classification in the "Marijuana and other substance" class and the "Opiate use" class compared to the "No substance/single substance" class. IPV was associated with both polysubstance use classes ("Alcohol plus other substance" and "Marijuana plus other substance") along with the "Opiate use" class compared to the "No substance/single substance" class. These classes highlight profiles of suicide descendants and emphasize the importance of polysubstance use prevention among females, homeless individuals, and those who experience IPV.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Rifampicin and/or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (RR/MDR-TB) remains an uncontrolled public health emergency that has been synergized by the recently increased person-to-person transmission in the community as primary RR/MDR-TB, which is defined as RR/MDR-TB in new TB patients with no prior exposure to anti-TB treatment for more than one month. This study aimed to measure the prevalence and associated factors of primary drug-resistance among drug-resistant tuberculosis patients, as evidenced by the Amhara region treatment initiating centers. Method(s): An institutional-based multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2010 to December 2017, among 580 RR/MDR-TB patients on the second-line anti-TB drug in the Amhara regional state. Data were collected from patient charts and registration books using a standardized data abstraction sheet. The data were entered using Epi-data 4.2.0.0 and transferred to Stata 14 software for further data management and analysis. A bivariable and multivariable binary logistic model was run subsequently, and finally, a p-value of less than 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to declare the significance of the explanatory variable. Result(s): The magnitude of primary drug resistance among drug-resistant tuberculosis patients was 15.69% (95% CI: 12.94, 18.89). Alcohol drinking (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.12-0.82), khat chewing (AOR = 4.43; 95% CI: 1.67-11.76), ambulatory and bedridden functional status (AOR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.24-0.76) and (AOR = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.19-0.91), respectively, positive sputum smear result (AOR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.26-0.90), and HIV coinfec-tion (AOR= 2.31; 95% CI: 1.31-4.06) remained statistically significant associated factors of primary RR/MDR-TB. Conclusion(s): Primary drug resistance is a public health problem in the study setting. Different behavioral and clinical conditions were significant factors of primary drug-resistant development. Mitigation strategies targeted on the patient's clinical condition, substance-related behaviors, and universal DST coverage might be very important for early detection and treatment of RR/MDR-TB to prevent community-level transmission.Copyright © 2021 Kassa et al.

N2  - Objective: To assess the relationship between experiencing homelessness and assisting injection drug use (IDU) initiation among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Tijuana, Mexico and Vancouver, Canada. Method(s): We used self-reported questionnaire data collected semi-annually on PWID from Tijuana (n = 703) and Vancouver (n = 1551) between 2014 and 2017. Within each setting, the effect of recent (i.e., past six months) homelessness on recent provision of injection initiation assistance (i.e., helping anybody inject for the first time in the past six months) was estimated using inverse-probability-of-treatment (IPT)-weighted estimation of a marginal structural model. Result(s): Across follow-up, the prevalence of recent homelessness at a given visit ranged from 11.6%-16.5% among Tijuana-based participants and 9.4%-18.9% among Vancouver-based participants; the prevalence of recent provision of injection initiation at a given follow-up visit was lower, ranging from 3.3%-5.4% in Tijuana and 2.5%-4.1% in Vancouver. Based on the IPT-weighted estimates, recent homelessness was associated with 66% greater odds among Tijuana-based PWID (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 1.66; 95% CI: 1.01-2.73) and 47% greater odds among Vancouver-based PWID (AOR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.02-2.13) of providing injection initiation assistance over the same six-month period. Conclusion(s): We found that recently experiencing homelessness was associated with an increased likelihood of PWID reporting IDU initiation assistance over time in both Tijuana and Vancouver. Addressing homelessness may decrease the initiation of IDU via multiple pathways.Copyright © 2021

N2  - Introduction: MDR/RR-TB is a growing problem in Kyrgyzstan. In 2005, the country introduced standard or individualized treatment for 20-24 months. Because of poor treatment outcomes, in 2017 a short treatment with strict eligibility criteria was introduced. The aim of this study was to compare characteristics and treatment outcomes of MDR/RR-TB patients receiving short (9-12 months) treatment in 2017 with those receiving standard or individualized (20-24 months) treatment in 2016/2017. Methodology: A comparative cohort study using routine programmatic data. Characteristics, sputum culture conversion and treatment outcomes were compared between those on short treatment with those on standard/individualized treatment using the chi-square test, crude and adjusted risk ratios (RR and aRR). Result(s): The study included 274, 82 and 132 patients on standard, individualized and short treatment, respectively. There were more females, fewer migrants/homeless and unemployed and more new TB patients on short treatment compared with the other two groups. A favorable outcome (cure and treatment completed) was significantly higher in short treatment patients (83%) compared with those on standard (50%) or individualized (59%) treatment (p < 0.001). There was higher 1-month sputum culture conversion with short treatment (35%) compared with the other two groups (19% and 24%, p < 0.05). Short treatment (aRR 1.6, 1.4-1.8), female gender (aRR 1.2, 1.1-1.4), not being homeless (aRR 12.9, 4.5-17.3) and having new TB (aRR 1.3, 1.0-1.5) were independently associated with a favorable outcome. Conclusion(s): The treatment success was higher in selected MDR-TB patients given short treatment in Kyrgyzstan: This regimen should be scaled-up to all MDR-TB patients.Copyright © 2021 Zhdanova et al.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had dramatic effects on the lives of children globally. However, socially vulnerable children have been particularly impacted. Certain populations have increased vulnerabilities, including children and youth experiencing homelessness. Increased infection risk due to congregant living and challenges with physical distancing are contributing factors. An urgent need exists for a wholistic approach to care with unique cross-sectoral partnerships across disciplines. A recognition of the unintended consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic on this population is urgently required by all those supporting children. Families should receive direct support in clinical settings to identify their social needs. Partnership with community agencies and advocacy for appropriate isolation facilities for patients experiencing homelessness are critical.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - Objective: Helplines are generally a population-level resource for providing free, timely, easy-to-access, and anonymous counseling and/or information. Helplines have been developed and widely implemented for specific use by young people. The current study aimed to systematically review the literature to determine the status of research into the use of helplines among young people. Method(s): Following the PRISMA checklist, 5 electronic databases were searched using relevant terms for literature published until May 2020. The extracted studies were summarized with the intention of identifying key themes that highlighted common findings, key implications, and important gaps in understanding. Result(s): A total of 52 articles fitting study inclusion criteria were identified. Most studies were quantitative papers from the United States and Australia. The types of helpline interactions studied were a mixture of telephone-based and SMS/text-based interactions. Three major themes were identified: awareness of and engagement with helpline services, nature of problems faced by young people, and service-related factors. Subthemes were use and awareness, barriers to help seeking, psychosocial problems, suicidality, telephone- versus text-based interactions, counselor-caller interaction, and provision of services to historically and systemically marginalized groups. Conclusion(s): It appears that helplines may provide a beneficial service to youths, and that myriad psychosocial concerns provide the basis for calling. The literature is limited by a lack of controlled trials, on one hand, and complex methodological/ethical barriers preventing such trials, on the other hand. However, more research is needed before conclusions regarding effectiveness in youths can be made, particularly for services provided to systemically marginalized groups and using online text-based approaches.Copyright © 2020 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry

N2  - Objectives: To examine parental beliefs and logistical challenges to early childhood vaccination completion as well as opportunities to support improved vaccine uptake among families experiencing homelessness. Study design: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between February 2018 and October 2019 with parents of children ages 19-35 months old experiencing homelessness. Participants were recruited from 10 locations that serve families experiencing homelessness in Washington, DC and by referral from other participants. Vaccination records were obtained from health care providers to determine the child's up-to-date (UTD) status with a combined 7-vaccine series. Result(s): Of 135 children of participants, only 69 (51.1%) were UTD. Most participants had at least 1 concern about childhood vaccines and at least 1 logistical barrier to completing vaccination (57% and 85.9%, respectively). The most frequent barriers were getting a convenient appointment time (46.3%), remembering appointments (44.8%), and commuting to appointments (44.4%). Although only 53.3% of the participants' children attended a licensed daycare center and only 43.7% received benefits from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), use of either of these programs that routinely assess vaccination status was associated with over 3 times higher adjusted odds of being UTD (aOR 3.4, 95% CI 1.6-7.3, and aOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4-6.5, respectively). Conclusion(s): Logistical barriers to accessing primary care services are common among children experiencing homelessness, underscoring the importance of health care providers offering vaccines at every opportunity. Government-regulated programs are useful for promoting vaccination, and enrollment should be encouraged because many children experiencing homelessness may not access them.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Social Problem-Solving and Suicidal Ideation Among Homeless Youth Receiving a Cognitive Therapy Intervention: A Moderated Mediation Analysis
A1  - Zhang J.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Despite the high prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts among homeless youth, little research has examined how suicide prevention interventions influence suicide-related risk and protective factors, and ultimately produce positive outcome in suicidality in this population. Drawing on the Diathesis-Stress Model and the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, the current study examined whether participation in Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) moderated the mediation link between social problem-solving, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, and suicidal ideation among a sample of homeless youth experiencing suicidal ideation. Social problem-solving refers to a set of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral coping responses in the face of stressful situations, and it is identified as a potent protective factor in alleviating perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, and reducing suicidal ideation. Participants included 150 homeless youth (M age = 20.99, range = 18-24; 41% female) who were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) (n = 75) or Treatment as Usual alone (n = 75). Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Findings showed that perceived burdensomeness mediated the association of social problem-solving with suicidal ideation only among youth participating in the CTSP condition. These findings provide evidence to support the promising effects of CTSP in enhancing the protective effects of social problem-solving on suicidal ideation through the mediating effects of perceived burdensomeness. Findings also have implications for improving intervention effectiveness with a community-based population at high risk of suicide.Copyright © 2020

N2  - Background: While lockdown restrictions in response to COVID-19 indisputably mitigated virus transmission, the aim of this longitudinal study was to establish indirect effects on vulnerable young people's mental well-being and physical activity (PA) levels. Method(s): Surveys conducted at time 1 (February 2020), and time 2 (April 2020) comprised of the short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and self-reported moderate and vigorous PA levels. Repeated measures analyses established changes pre-post lockdown restrictions, and differences between sub-groups. Associations between changes in well-being, self-esteem and PA over time were explored through further regression analyses. Result(s): 65 respondents completed the survey at time 1, and 50 respondent at time 2. Wellbeing increased significantly over time, yet remained significantly lower than the population average. Self-esteem increased significantly post-lockdown, however remained significantly lower for females, compared with males. Overall, PA levels increased-whereby 'inactive' participants at time 1 reported significant increases in moderate and total activity levels at time 2. Increased PA levels significantly predicted increased well-being: F(1, 48) = 4.15, p < .05; while participants who had become less active accounted for 69.2% with low self-esteem at time 2. Conclusion(s): Findings indicate that increased PA accounted for improved mental well-being, while decreased PA was associated with reduced levels of self-esteem. PA may represent a modifiable means of mitigating risk, and promoting resilience for vulnerable young people experiencing adverse conditions.Copyright © 2021

N2  - This paper presents data from an online sample of U.S gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM), to explore the factors associated with three dimensions of vaccine beliefs: perception of the likelihood of a COVID-19 vaccine becoming available, perception of when a COVID-19 vaccine would become available, and the likelihood of taking a COVID-19 vaccine. Data are taken from the Love and Sex in the Time of COVID-19 study, collected from November 2020 to January 2021. A sample of 290 GBMSM is analyzed, modeling three binary outcomes: belief that there will be a COVID-19 vaccine, belief that the COVID-19 vaccine will be available in 6 months, and being very likely to take the COVID-19 vaccine. In contrast to other studies, Black/African Americans and GBMSM living with HIV had higher levels of pandemic optimism and were more likely to be willing to accept a vaccine. Men who perceived a higher prevalence of COVID-19 among their friends and sex partners, and those who had reduced their sex partners, were more likely to be willing to take a COVID-19 vaccine. There remained a small percentage of participants (14%) who did not think the pandemic would end, that there would not be a vaccine and were unlikely to take a vaccine. To reach the levels of vaccination necessary to control the pandemic, it is imperative to understand the characteristics of those experiencing vaccine hesitancy and then tailor public health messages to their unique set of barriers and motivations.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Background: People experiencing homelessness have higher rates of HIV than those who are stably housed. Mental health needs, substance use problems, and issues unique to homelessness such as lack of shelter and transiency need to be considered with regard to HIV prevention. To date, HIV prevention interventions for young adults experiencing homelessness have not specifically addressed modifiable real-time factors such as stress, sexual or drug use urge, or substance use, or been delivered at the time of heightened risk. Real-time, personalized HIV prevention messages may reduce HIV risk behaviors. Objective(s): This pilot study tested the initial efficacy of an innovative, smartphone-based, just-in-time adaptive intervention that assessed predictors of HIV risk behaviors in real time and automatically provided behavioral feedback and goal attainment information. Method(s): A randomized attention control design was used among young adults experiencing homelessness, aged 18-25 years, recruited from shelters and drop-in centers in May 2019. Participants were randomized to either a control or an intervention group. The intervention (called MY-RID [Motivating Youth to Reduce Infection and Disconnection]) consisted of brief messages delivered via smartphone over 6 weeks in response to preidentified predictors that were assessed using ecological momentary assessments. Bayesian hierarchical regression models were used to assess intervention effects on sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, and their corresponding urges. Result(s): Participants (N=97) were predominantly youth (mean age 21.2, SD 2.1 years) who identified as heterosexual (n=51, 52%), male (n=56, 57%), and African American (n=56, 57%). Reports of sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, stress, and all urges (ie, sexual, drug, alcohol) reduced over time in both groups. Daily drug use reduced by a factor of 13.8 times over 6 weeks in the intervention group relative to the control group (Multimedia Appendix 4). Lower urges for sex were found in the intervention group relative to the control group over the duration of the study. Finally, there was a statistically significant reduction in reports of feeling stressed the day before between the intervention and control conditions (P=.03). Conclusion(s): Findings indicate promising intervention effects on drug use, stress, and urges for sex in a hard-to-reach, high-risk population. The MY-RID intervention should be further tested in a larger randomized controlled trial to further investigate its efficacy and impact on sexual risk behaviors.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Inhalants, also known as volatile substances or solvents, are volatile hydrocarbons, which become gases at room temperature. Inhalants are substances commonly used by homeless teenagers. The effects of this substance vary including stamina enhancing effect, self-resistance, agitation, paranoid, hallucinations, and chest pain. We expect that this case report is able to show how vulnerable teens are to become users of illegal substance, such as inhalants, particularly those who come from low socio-economical background. CASE REPORT: Mental emotional disorders are commonly found among a 14-18-year-old man who engages in glue sniffing that may end up with jail. Most of the cases in Medan were found in children from broken home families or with low financial background, dropping out of school, and those suffering from bullying. Therefore, we particularly report a case of a 14-year-old boy who uses inhalant (glue) in Medan. CONCLUSION(S): Several studies show that the use of inhalants in street children is quite high.Copyright © 2021 Rinaldi Fajri, Mustafa M. Amin, Elmeida Effendy.

N2  - Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic has profound negative impacts on people's lives, but little is known on its effect on household food insecurity (HFI) in poor setting resources. This study assessed changes in HFI during the pandemic and examined the interlinkages between HFI with child feeding practices and coping strategies. Design A longitudinal survey in December 2019 (in-person) and August 2020 (by phone). Setting Community-based individuals from 26 blocks in 2 districts in Uttar Pradesh, India. Participants Mothers with children <2 years (n=569). Main outcomes and analyses We measured HFI by using the HFI Access Scale and examined the changes in HFI during the pandemic using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests. We then assessed child feeding practices and coping strategies by HFI status using multivariable regression models. Results HFI increased sharply from 21% in December 2019 to 80% in August 2020, with 62% households changing the status from food secure to insecure over this period. Children in newly or consistently food-insecure households were less likely to consume a diverse diet (adjusted OR, AOR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.95 and AOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.12, respectively) compared with those in food-secure households. Households with consistent food insecurity were more likely to engage in coping strategies such as reducing other essential non-food expenditures (AOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.09 to 4.24), borrowing money to buy food (AOR 4.3, 95% CI 2.31 to 7.95) or selling jewellery (AOR 5.0, 95% CI 1.74 to 14.27) to obtain foods. Similar findings were observed for newly food-insecure households. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic and its lockdown measures posed a significant risk to HFI which in turn had implications for child feeding practices and coping strategies. Our findings highlight the need for further investment in targeted social protection strategies and safety nets as part of multisectoral solutions to improve HFI during and after COVID-19.Copyright © Author(s) 2021.

N2  - Objective: In adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer, we examined (1) the distribution and type of traumatic events (TEs) experienced prior to baseline assessment and (2) how a resilience intervention, Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM), impacted changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for AYAs with and without TEs. Method(s): AYAs (12-25 years) within 1-10 weeks of diagnosis of new malignancy or ever diagnosed with advanced cancer were enrolled and randomly assigned to usual care (UC) with or without PRISM. To assess TEs, we screened medical records for traditionally defined adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and medical traumatic events. Age-validated PROs assessed resilience, benefit-finding, hope, generic health-related quality of life (QoL), cancer-specific QoL, depression, and anxiety at enrollment and 6 months later. We calculated effect sizes (Cohen's d) for PRISM vs. UC effect on PRO score change at 6 months for 1+ TEs and 0 TE groups. Result(s): Ninety-two AYAs enrolled and completed baseline surveys (44-UC, 48-PRISM; N = 74 at 6 months, 38-UC, 36-PRISM); 60% experienced 1+ TEs. PROs at baseline were similar across groups. PRISM's effect on score change was greater (Cohen's d >= 0.5) for the 1+ TE group on domains of benefit-finding and hope; and similar (d < 0.5) on domains of resilience, depression, anxiety, and both generic and cancer-specific QoL. Conclusion(s): In AYAs with cancer, TEs occurred at similar rates as the general population. PRISM may be particularly helpful for improving benefit-finding and hope for those who have experienced TEs.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Background: The rate of alcohol-related mortality in people experiencing homelessness and alcohol use disorder is high and necessitates accessible and effective treatment for alcohol use disorder. However, typical abstinence-based treatments do not optimally engage this population. Recent studies have shown that harm-reduction treatment, which does not require abstinence, but instead aims to incrementally reduce alcohol-related harm and improve health-related quality of life, is acceptable to and effective for this population. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of combined pharmacological and behavioural harm-reduction treatment for alcohol use disorder (HaRT-A) in people experiencing homelessness and alcohol use disorder. Method(s): This randomised clinical trial was done at three community-based service sites (low-barrier shelters and housing programmes) in Seattle (WA, USA). Eligible participants were adults (aged 21-65 years) who met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for alcohol use disorder and who experienced homelessness in the past year. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) by permuted block randomisation, stratified by site, to receive either HaRT-A plus intramuscular injections of 380 mg extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX; HaRT-A plus XR-NTX group); HaRT-A plus placebo injection (HaRT-A plus placebo group); HaRT-A alone (HaRT-A alone group); or community-based supportive services as usual (services-as-usual control group). Patients assigned to receive HaRT-A attended sessions at baseline (week 0) and in weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12. XR-NTX and placebo injections were administered in weeks 0, 4, and 8. During the study, participants, interventionists, and investigators were masked to group assignment in the two injection arms. All participants were invited to follow-up assessments at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, and 36. The primary outcomes were self-reported alcohol use quantity (ie, alcohol quantity consumed on peak drinking occasion, as measured with the Alcohol Quantity Use Assessment questionnaire) and frequency (measured with the Addiction Severity Index), alcohol-related harm (measured with the Short Inventory of Problems-2R questionnaire), and physical and mental health-related quality of life (measured with the Short Form-12 survey). Using piecewise growth modelling and an intention-to-treat model, we compared the effects of the three active treatment groups with the services-as-usual control group, and the HaRT-A plus XR-NTX group with the HaRT-A plus placebo group, over the 12-week treatment course and during the 24 weeks following treatment withdrawal. Safety analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01932801. Finding(s): Between Oct 14, 2013, and Nov 30, 2017, 417 individuals experiencing homelessness and alcohol use disorder were screened, of whom 308 were eligible and randomly assigned to the HaRT-A plus XR-NTX group (n=74), the HaRT-A plus placebo group (n=78), the HaRT-A alone group (n=79), or the services-as-usual control group (n=77). Compared with the services-as-usual control group, the HaRT-A plus XR-NTX group showed significant improvements from baseline to 12 weeks post-treatment across four of the five primary outcomes: peak alcohol quantity (linear B -0.48 [95% CI -0.79 to -0.18] p=0.010; full model Cohen's d=-0.68), alcohol frequency (linear B -4.42 [-8.09 to -0.76], p=0.047; full model Cohen's d=-0.16), alcohol-related harm (linear B -2.22 [-3.39 to -1.06], p=0.002; full model Cohen's d=-0.56), and physical health-related quality of life (linear B 0.66 [0.23 to 1.10], p=0.012; full model Cohen's d=0.43). Compared with the services-as-usual control group, the HaRT-A plus placebo group showed significant improvements in three of the five primary outcomes: peak alcohol quantity (linear B -0.41 [95% CI -0.67 to -0.15] p=0.010; full model Cohen's d=-0.23), alcohol frequency (linear B -5.95 [-9.72 to -2.19], p=0.009; full model Cohen's d=-0.13), and physical health-related quality of life (linear B 0.53 [0.09 to 0.98], p=0.050; full model Cohen's d=0.35). Compared with the services-as-usual control group, the HaRT-A alone group showed significant improvements in two of the five primary outcomes: alcohol-related harm (linear B -1.58 [95% CI -2.73 to -0.42] p=0.025; full model Cohen's d=-0.40) and physical health-related quality of life (linear B 0.63 [0.18 to 1.07], p=0.020; full model Cohen's d=0.41). After treatment discontinuation at 12 weeks, the active treatment groups plateaued, whereas the services-as-usual group showed improvements. Thus, during the post-treatment period (weeks 12 to 36), the services-as-usual control group showed greater reductions in alcohol-related harm compared with both the HaRT-A plus XR-NTX group (linear B 0.96 [0.24 to 1.67], p=0.028; full model Cohen's d=0.24) and the HaRT-A alone group (linear B 1.02 [0.35 to 1.70], p=0.013; full model Cohen's d=0.26). During the post-treatment period, the services-as-usual control group significantly improved on mental health-related quality of life compared with the HaRT-A alone group (linear B -0.46 [-0.79 to -0.12], p=0.024; full model Cohen's d=-0.28), and on physical health-related quality of life compared with the HaRT-A plus XR-NTX group (linear B -0.42 [-0.67 to -0.17], p=0.006; full model Cohen's d=-0.27), the HaRT-A plus placebo group (linear B -0.42 [-0.69 to -0.15], p=0.009; full model Cohen's d=-0.27), and the HaRT-A alone group (linear B -0.47 [-0.72 to -0.22], p=0.002; full model Cohen's d=-0.31). For all other primary outcomes, there were no significant linear differences between the services-as-usual and active treatment groups. When comparing the HaRT-A plus placebo group with the HaRT-A plus XR-NTX group, there were no significant differences for any of the primary outcomes. Missing data analysis indicated that participants were more likely to drop out in the services-as-usual control group than in the active treatment groups; however, primary outcome findings were found to be robust to attrition. Participants in the HaRT-A plus XR-NTX, HaRT-A plus placebo, and HaRT-A alone groups were not more likely to experience adverse events than those in the services-as-usual control group. Interpretation(s): Compared with existing services, combined pharmacological and behavioural harm-reduction treatment resulted in decreased alcohol use and alcohol-related harm and improved physical health-related quality of life during the 12-week treatment period for people experiencing homelessness and alcohol use disorder. Although not as consistent, there were also positive findings for behavioural harm-reduction treatment alone. Considering the non-significant differences between participants receiving HaRT-A plus placebo and HaRT-A plus XR-NTX, the combined pharmacological and behavioural treatment effect cannot be attributed to XR-NTX alone. Future studies are needed to further investigate the relative contributions of the pharmacological and behavioural components of harm-reduction treatment for alcohol use disorder, and to ascertain whether a maintenance treatment approach could extend these positive outcome trajectories.

N2  - Purpose: Contact tracing is intended to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it is difficult to conduct among people who live in congregate settings, including people experiencing homelessness (PEH). This analysis compares person-based contact tracing among two populations in Salt Lake County, Utah, from March-May 2020. Method(s): All laboratory-confirmed positive cases among PEH (n = 169) and documented in Utah's surveillance system were included in this analysis. The general population comparison group (n = 163) were systematically selected from all laboratory-confirmed cases identified during the same period. Result(s): Ninety-three PEH cases (55%) were interviewed compared to 163 (100%) cases among the general population (P <.0001). PEH were more likely to be lost to follow-up at end of isolation (14.2%) versus the general population (0%; P-value <.0001) and provided fewer contacts per case (0.3) than the general population (4.7) (P-value <.0001). Contacts of PEH were more often unreachable (13.0% vs. 7.1%; P-value <.0001). Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that contact tracing among PEH should include a location-based approach, along with a person-based approach when resources allow, due to challenges in identifying, locating, and reaching cases among PEH and their contacts through person-based contact tracing efforts alone.Copyright © 2021

N2  - Objective To assess the prevalence of and factors associated with depression among adolescent boys and girls. Design We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study. Setting This study was carried out in 82 randomly selected clusters (57 rural, 15 non-slum urban and 10 slums) from eight divisions of Bangladesh. Participants We interviewed 4907 adolescent boys and 4949 adolescent girls. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome measure was 'any depression' and the secondary outcome measures were types of depression: no or minimal, mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe. Results The overall prevalence of no or minimal, mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression was 75.5%, 17.9%, 5,4%, 1.1% and 0.1%, respectively. Across most of the sociodemographic, lifestyle and anthropometric strata, the prevalence of any depression was higher among adolescent girls. In both sexes, depression was associated with higher age, higher maternal education, paternal occupation e.g., business, absence of a 6-9-year-old member in the household, food insecurity, household consumption of unfortified oil, household use of non-iodised salt, insufficient physical activity (adjusted odds ratio, AOR: 1.24 for boys, 1.44 for girls) and increased television viewing time e.g., >=121 minute/day (AOR: 1.95 for boys, 1.99 for girls). Only among boys, depression was also associated with higher paternal education e.g., complete secondary and above (AOR: 1.42), absence of another adolescent member in the household (AOR: 1.34), household use of solid biomass fuel (AOR: 1.39), use of any tobacco products (AOR: 2.17), and consumption of processed food (AOR: 1.24). Only among girls, non-slum urban residence, Muslim religion, and household size <=4 were also associated with depression. Conclusion The prevalence of depression among adolescent boys and girls is high in Bangladesh. In most sociodemographic, lifestyle and anthropometric strata, the prevalence is higher among girls. In this age group, depression is associated with a number of sociodemographic and lyfestyle factors. The government of Bangladesh should consider these findings while integrating adolescent mental health in the existing and future programmes.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

N2  - Heart disease, including hypertension, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among persons experiencing homelessness (PEH). PEH exhibit a greater number of modifiable risk factors for hypertension than the general population and are challenged to reach optimal blood pressure control despite receiving medical treatment. This descriptive qualitative study used data collected from three focus groups to explore the barriers and facilitators of self-management of hypertension while experiencing homelessness. Participants discussed co-morbidity, limited food choices, medication issues, stress, and negative health care provider experiences as the biggest barriers toward self-management of hypertension. To address the barriers described above, participants discussed strategies to manage their medications, healthy eating, exercise, social support, and reducing stress. Strategies for health care practitioners and shelter providers to reduce barriers to self-management of hypertension among PEH are discussed.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  - Background: Surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among sheltered homeless and other vulnerable people might provide the information needed to prevent its spread within accommodation centres. Method(s): Data were obtained from 698 participants in different accommodation centres (411 homeless individuals, 77 asylum-seekers, 58 other people living in precarious conditions and 152 employees working in these accommodation centres) who completed questionnaires and had nasal samples collected between 26 March and 17 April 2020. SARS-CoV-2 carriage was assessed by quantitative PCR. Result(s): We found a high acceptance rate (78.9%) for testing. Overall, 49 people (7.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, including 37 homeless individuals (of 411, 9.0%) and 12 employees (of 152, 7.9%). SARS-CoV-2 positivity correlated with symptoms, although 51% of patients who tested positive did not report respiratory symptoms or fever. Among homeless people, being young (18-34 years) (odds ratio 3.83, 95% confidence interval 1.47-10.0, p = 0.006) and being housed in one specific shelter (odds ratio 9.13, 95% confidence interval 4.09-20.37, p < 0.001) were independent factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (rates of 11.4% and 20.6%, respectively). Discussion(s): Symptom screening alone is insufficient to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in vulnerable sheltered people. Systematic testing should be promoted.Copyright © 2021 The Authors

T1  - The association between experiencing homelessness in childhood or youth and adult housing stability in Housing First

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Background: Researchers have pointed out the paucity of research investigating long-term consequences of experiencing homelessness in childhood or youth. Limited research has indicated that the experience of homelessness in childhood or youth is associated with adverse adjustment-related consequences in adulthood. Housing First (HF) has acknowledged effectiveness in improving housing outcomes among adults experiencing homelessness and living with serious mental illness, although some HF clients struggle with maintaining housing. The current study was conducted to examine whether the experience of homelessness in childhood or youth increases the odds of poorer housing stability following entry into high-fidelity HF among adults experiencing serious mental illness and who were formerly homeless. Method(s): Data were drawn from the active intervention arms of a HF randomized controlled trial in Metro Vancouver, Canada. Participants (n = 297) were referred to the study from service agencies serving adults experiencing homelessness and mental illness between October 2009 and June 2011. The Residential Time-Line Follow-Back Inventory was used to measure housing stability. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to estimate the association between first experiencing homelessness in childhood or youth and later housing stability as an adult in HF. Result(s): Analyses indicated that homelessness in childhood or youth was negatively associated with experiencing housing stability as an adult in HF (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.31-0.90). Conclusion(s): Further supports are needed within HF to increase housing stability among adult clients who have experienced homelessness in childhood or youth. Asking clients about the age they first experienced homelessness may be of clinical utility upon enrollment in HF and may help identify support needs related to developmental experiences. Results further emphasize the importance of intervening earlier in life in childhood and youth before experiencing homelessness or before it becomes chronic. Findings also contribute to a limited knowledge base regarding the adverse long-term consequences of childhood and youth homelessness.

N2  - Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with substance use disorders (SUD) have low rates of engagement and retention in SUD treatment (Mericle et al., 2015). Engagement and retention refers to treatment attendance and regular communication with providers. The reason for this low rate is multifactorial and includes the stigma surrounding SUD and treatment (Bagley, Hadland, Carney, & Saitz, 2017), and challenges accessing developmentally appropriate treatment (Mericle et al., 2015; Sterling, Weisner, Hinman, & Parthasarathy, 2010). Yet engaging AYA early in their trajectory of substance use offers an invaluable opportunity to minimize the short-term and long-term consequences of use (Compton et al., 2019; Levy, Williams, & Prevention, C. on S. U. A., 2016). As specialists in pediatric addiction, we made significant changes in how we provide care for youth in treatment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the following commentary, we discuss the potential positive and negative impacts of those changes and suggestions for future research.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone and extended-release injection naltrexone are effective treatments, with distinct mechanisms, for opioid use disorder. The authors examined whether patients' demographic and clinical characteristics were associated with better response to one medication or the other. METHOD(S): In a multisite 24-week randomized comparative-effectiveness trial of assignment to buprenorphine-naloxone (N=287) compared with extended-release naltrexone (N=283) comprising inpatients planning to initiate medication treatment for opioid use disorder, 50 demographic and clinical characteristics were examined as moderators of the effect of medication assignment on relapse to regular opioid use and failure to initiate medication. Moderator-by-medication interactions were estimated using logistic regression with correction for multiple testing. RESULT(S): In the intent-to-treat sample, patients who reported being homeless had a lower relapse rate if they were assigned to receive extended-release naltrexone (51.6%) compared with buprenorphine-naloxone (70.4%) (odds ratio=0.45, 95% CI=0.22, 0.90); patients who were not homeless had a higher relapse rate if they were assigned to extended-release naltrexone (70.9%) compared with buprenorphine-naloxone (53.1%) (odds ratio=2.15, 95% CI=1.44, 3.21). In the subsample of patients who initiated medication, the interaction was not significant, with a similar pattern of lower relapse with extended-release naltrexone (41.4%) compared with buprenorphine (68.6%) among homeless patients (odds ratio=0.32, 95% CI=0.15, 0.68) but less difference among those not homeless (extended-release naltrexone, 57.2%; buprenorphine, 52.0%; odds ratio=1.24, 95% CI=0.80, 1.90). For failure to initiate medication, moderators were stated preference for medication (failure was less likely if the patient was assigned to the medication preferred), parole and probation status (fewer failures with extended-release naltrexone for those on parole or probation), and presence of pain and timing of randomization (more failure with extended-release naltrexone for patients endorsing moderate to severe pain and randomized early while still undergoing medically managed withdrawal). CONCLUSION(S): Among patients with opioid use disorder admitted to inpatient treatment, homelessness, parole and probation status, medication preference, and factors likely to influence tolerability of medication initiation may be important in matching patients to buprenorphine or extended-release naltrexone.

N2  - Homeless youth experience high rates of suicidal ideation and attempts, yet limited research has examined predictors of treatment engagement among this population. Suicidal homeless youth (N=150) between the ages of 18 and 24 years were recruited from a drop-in center in Columbus, Ohio. Participants were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention+treatment as usual through a local drop-in center (CTSP+TAU) (N=75) or TAU alone (N=75), and treatment attendance among those assigned to CTSP+TAU was examined in this study. As expected, among youth engaged in CTSP+TAU, those with a history of intimate partner violence (IPV) showed decreased odds of treatment attendance. Additionally, youth randomized into CTSP+TAU with higher acquired capability for suicide (ACS) scores and those identifying as Black were more likely to attend treatment sessions. Findings suggest that effective treatment implementation must consider youth's trauma history, demographics and severity of suicidal ideation and behaviors.Copyright © 2021.

N2  - This study examined the food security and gardening practices of mothers with young children. Participants were adult mothers with young children aged 0-6 years living in Prince Edward Island (PEI) and using Family Resource Center services. Controlling for marital status, education level, and race, data were analyzed using cumulative odds ordinal logistic regression with proportional odds. Forty percent of participants were living in food-insecure households. Mothers who gardened vegetables were associated with 1.94 times higher odds of living in a more food secure household, compared to non-gardeners (p = .052). Nutrition education programs that improve household economic self-sufficiency are warranted.Copyright © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Introduction: Healthcare systems are increasingly interested in identifying patients' housing-related risks, but minimal information exists to inform screening question selection. The primary study aim is to evaluate discordance among 5 housing-related screening questions used in health care. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional multisite survey of social risks used in a convenience sample of adults seeking care for themselves or their child at 7 primary care clinics and 4 emergency departments across 9 states (2018-2019). Housing-related risks were measured using 2 questions from the Accountable Health Communities screening tool (current/anticipated housing instability, current housing quality problems) and 3 from the Children's HealthWatch recommended housing instability screening measures (prior 12-month: rent/mortgage strain, number of moves, current/recent homelessness). The 2-sided Fisher's exact tests analyzed housing-related risks and participant characteristics; logistic regression explored associations with reported health (2019-2020). Result(s): Of 835 participants, 52% screened positive for >=1 housing-related risk (n=430). Comparing the tools, 32.8% (n=274) screened discordant: 11.9% (n=99) screened positive by Children's HealthWatch questions but negative by Accountable Health Communities, and 21.0% (n=175) screened positive by the Accountable Health Communities tool but negative by Children's HealthWatch (p<0.001). Worse health was associated with screening positive for current/anticipated housing instability (AOR=0.56, 95% CI=0.32, 0.96) or current/recent homelessness (AOR=0.57, 95% CI=0.34, 0.96). Conclusion(s): The 5 housing questions captured different housing-related risks, contributed to different health consequences, and were relevant to different subpopulations. Before implementing housing-related screening initiatives, health systems should understand how specific measures surface distinct housing-related barriers. Measure selection should depend on program goals and intervention resources.Copyright © 2021 American Journal of Preventive Medicine

N2  - In high-income countries, breastfeeding has been shown to be positively associated with socioeconomic position. However, less is known about breastfeeding practices and their associated factors among extremely disadvantaged populations. We aimed to assess the associations of cultural origins and socioeconomic factors with any breastfeeding initiation and duration in homeless families. We analyzed data from 456 children aged 6 months to 5 years from the cross-sectional ENFAMS survey, conducted in 2013 among a random sample of homeless families in shelters in the Greater Paris area. Data were collected by bilingual interviewers in 17 languages. Four nested multivariable robust Poisson regression models were run in a hierarchical framework to determine the factors associated with breastfeeding initiation and with any breastfeeding for 6 months or more. Most of the children (86.0%) had previously been or were currently being breastfed at the time of the survey; 58.9% were fed with breast milk >=6 months. A higher maternal age and African origin were positively associated with breastfeeding >=6 months, although the relation to the region of origin was moderated by education level. Migration to escape war, unrest or other violence and the child's birth in France were inversely associated with breastfeeding >=6 months. Any breastfeeding by these homeless mothers seems influenced predominantly by their cultural origin and complicated by a difficult migration trajectory. The possible influence of poor material circumstances and cumulative hardship should encourage interventions targeted at homeless mothers that emphasize social/family support with a commitment to improving the family's living conditions.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - This article offers descriptive and evaluative data for the first cohort of youth who lived in Canada's first transitional housing program for LGBTQ2S youth, operated by the YMCA of Greater Toronto. The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to report on how youth experienced living in an LGBTQ2S population-based housing program in relation to mental health, self-esteem, community participation and family connectedness, and how access to culturally competent services impact experiences of homelessness. The outcomes of this study are important for service providers, program managers, and policymakers to review in order to better understand how LGBTQ2S youth experience population-based housing programs and whether or not they positively impact their transition to adulthood. Although this study took place in Toronto, Canada, it has broader relevance nationally and internationally, and can be used to build the evidence base to guide the improvement, development, and evaluation of future LGBTQ2S housing services for youth.

N2  - This study examined the association of household food security and school participation in the community eligibility provision (CEP). Surveys were collected from 427 households within 5 schools participating in CEP, and therefore providing access to universal free school meals, and three matched comparison district schools, which were CEP-eligible but not participating. Multivariate logistic regression, adjusted for race/ethnicity and education level, revealed that the odds of being in a food insecure household were twice as likely for students attending CEP-eligible, but not participating schools than for students attending CEP schools [OR 2.85 (95% CI 1.67, 4.88)].Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - There is a high prevalence of Indigenous youth experiencing either precarious housing or homelessness in northwestern Ontario. Given that Indigenous pathways to homelessness can differ from non-Indigenous youth, interventions that address homelessness must also adapt to meet diverse needs. The Housing Outreach Program Collaborative (HOP-C) is a tertiary prevention intervention designed to provide congruent housing and peer and mental health supports for youth experiencing homelessness in Toronto, Ontario. Less is known regarding its adaptability to adequately serve Indigenous youth in northwestern Ontario. This study assessed the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of an adaptation of the HOP-C North program for transitional aged Indigenous youth exiting homelessness in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Participants completed premeasures (n = 15) and postmeasures (n = 8) as well as qualitative interviews regarding their experiences in the program. Qualitative interviews were also conducted with staff (n = 14) engaged in implementing the program. After completing the HOP-C North program, participants reported improvements in a number of outcomes, including increased educational enrollment, attainment of employment, reduced hospitalizations, and increased engagement in clinical mental health services. Specific program aspects that participants found helpful included increased program flexibility, accessibility, emphasis on relationships, relevance of programming, fostering participant autonomy, and an adaptive approach to program implementation. These findings suggest that the HOP-C North model, when adapted, is a helpful program for Indigenous youth. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Public Policy Relevance Statement: Maintaining housing stability for previously homeless Indigenous youth can be challenging as this population tends to have complex needs related to health, finances, and overall well-being. To help reduce these barriers related to this transition to housing and promote health, the Housing Outreach Program Collaborative North (HOP-C North) provided youth with culturally relevant supports, including individual and group counseling services, peer mentorship, case management, and cultural mentorship. HOP-C North was a cost-effective way to promote integrated health care for a population that may not otherwise access these supports. Future primary care housing program models may benefit from the approach used in HOP-C North.

N2  - Background Multiple complex needs (MCN) is one of a number of terms used to describe people facing co-occurring issues of homelessness, substance misuse, offending, and mental illhealth. When considered in isolation, homelessness, substance misuse, mental ill-health and offending, each contribute to high mortality rates; however, when co-occurring this effect is amplified. A large amount of the mortality research to date within MCN populations has been epidemiological. Despite acknowledge of the benefits of conducting research withindividuals rather than on, there is limited involvement of peer research methods in current studies exploring mortality and MCN. This research aimed to explore the perspectives of people with lived experience of MCN and professionals who support them on the perceived reasons underlying high mortality rates among people with MCN. Methods Using peer research methods, three focus group discussions (21 participants) were conducted within the North East of England to explore the perspectives of people with MCN, frontline staff, and managers/commissioners. Results Findings from this study provide valuable perspectives of people with MCN and those that provide them with support on what may be perceived factors underlying premature mortality. Mental ill-health and substance misuse (often cooccurring dual diagnosis) were perceived as influencing premature mortality among MCN groups. Perceptions of opportunities for identify people at-risk included critical life events (e.g. bereavement, relationship breakdown) and transitions (e.g. release from prison, completion of drug treatment). Early prevention, particularly supporting young people experiencing adverse childhood experiences was also highlighted as a priority. Conclusion High mortality in MCN groups may be reduced by addressing dual diagnosis, providing more support at critical life events, and investing in early prevention efforts. The novelty of this study is it has shown the value of listening to and conducting research with individuals with experience of MCN. It enabled an exploration of an issue that directly affects their community and supported understanding of the personal perspective of a handful of people with MCN and their carers on what may have informed premature mortality among their networks, as well as identifying perceived avenues for possible preventive interventions within the local region. Furthermore, the insights specific to opportunities for service provision take into consideration the intricate nature of MCN and improve service access and navigation.

N2  - Background. Young people who inject drugs (PWID) have higher HCV incidence and lower treatment initiation rates compared to their older peers. Novel, simplified care models need to be developed to engage, treat and cure hard to reach patient populations, such as young PWID. Methods. We present final data from the randomized pilot clinical trial HCVSeek Test & Rapid Treatment (HCV-ST&RT) for curing HCV in young PWID. Eligible participants were 18-29 years of age, HCV Ab+, treatment naive, and had injected drugs in the past 30 days. Participants were randomized 1:1 to the Rapid Treatment or Usual Care arm. Participants randomized to Rapid Treatment received a same-day medical evaluation, confirmatory and baseline lab testing, and 7-day starter pack of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Participants in Usual Care received same-day HCV confirmatory testing and, if positive, facilitated referral to local providers. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response (SVR12) in RNA+ participant within 12 months of enrollment. Results. Among 47 eligible participants, 38 were enrolled and randomized. 14/18 in the Rapid Treatment arm and 11/20 in the Usual Care arm were confirmed HCV RNA+ and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Demographics of the RNA+ participants were similar in the two arms with a mean age of 26 years; 24% women; 36% Hispanic and 4% non-Hispanic black. At baseline 24% were homeless, 52% received medication for opioid use disorder in the prior 90 days, and participants injected a median of 20 of the last 30 days. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 9/14 (64%) of the Rapid Treatment arm and 2/11 (18%) of the Usual Care arm had confirmed SVR12 (p=0.042). Of the 5 participants in the Rapid Treatment arm who did not achieve SVR12, 1 had treatment failure, 1 never started DAA therapy, 1 had an on-treatment response with pending SVR12 confirmation, and 2 were lost to follow-up. Conclusion. Among young HCV RNA+ PWID, significantly higher rates of cure were achieved using the Rapid Treatment model with same day, low-threshold, simplified HCV care compared to facilitated referral. Meeting young PWID where they're at and initiating HCV treatment 'in the moment' without the need for repeat visits appears to be a promising strategy for treating this hard to reach population.

N2  - Background: Homelessness as a complex and persistent public health challenge is an extreme form of social exclusion. Our understanding on the health of homeless populations is largely informed by research on the more visible street homelessness, highlighting ill health, substance dependencies, and reduced life expectancy. These estimates are likely to underestimate individual's health-care needs, alongside barriers to accessing care. We aimed to adopt a broad definition of homelessness to understand COVID-19-related health outcomes for this population. Method(s): Our definition includes street homelessness and precarious or insecure housing, thus including those known as hidden homeless who are not in government homelessness statistics. We generated an e-cohort of individuals with recorded lived experience of homelessness in Wales, by combining information across four routine health-care datasets (primary care, inpatient care, emergency department, and substance misuse service. A population comparison group was randomly selected from the Welsh Demographic Service database. We linked the e-cohort and comparison group with COVID-19 NHS Wales Test Trace and Protect, annual district death extract, and the patient episode database to examine the COVID-19 outcomes. This study is exempt from consent due to the anonymised nature of the databank. The independent Information Governance Review Panel approved this study. Finding(s): The e-cohort includes 15 472 individuals aged 16 years and older who visited the four health-care services in Wales since Jan 1, 2014, until July 31, 2020, including 1717 currently homeless during the pandemic in 2020 (69.2% were male and 42.0% were younger than 35 years). Of those people currently homeless during COVID-19, 54 (3.2%; 95% CI 2.4-4.1) tested positive for the virus, 16 (0.9%; 0.5-1.5) had COVID-19-related hospital admissions, and five (0.3%; 0.1-0.7) died, involving COVID-19. Compared with the general population comparison group (n=15 472), where 340 (2.20%; 1.97-2.44) tested positive, 11 (0.07%; 0.04-0.13) had COVID-19 related hospital admissions, and nine (0.06%; 0.03-0.11) died, involving COVID-19 (mentioned on death certificate). Interpretation(s): These findings suggest that COVID-19-related outcomes were worse for individuals who were homeless during the pandemic compared with the general population. The complex health needs and pre-existing vulnerabilities people who are homeless warrant further exploration. This study is likely to underestimate the population size and health needs due to relying on people seeking health care and disclosing their homeless or housing status, to which there are recognised barriers. Accurate and standardised coding of housing status in practise is an area that needs urgent improvement. Funding(s): Public Health Wales.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Background:Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) are at elevated risk of HIV/AIDS and disproportionately identify as racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minorities. We developed a new peer change agent (PCA) HIV prevention intervention with 3 arms: (1) an arm using an artificial intelligence (AI) planning algorithm to select PCAs; (2) a popularity arm, the standard PCA approach, operationalized as highest degree centrality (DC); and (3) an observation-only comparison group. Setting(s):A total of 713 YEH were recruited from 3 drop-in centers in Los Angeles, CA. Method(s):Youth consented and completed a baseline survey that collected self-reported data on HIV knowledge, condom use, and social network information. A quasi-experimental pretest/posttest design was used; 472 youth (66.5% retention at 1 month postbaseline) and 415 youth (58.5% retention at 3 months postbaseline) completed follow-up. In each intervention arm (AI and DC), 20% of youth was selected as PCAs and attended a 4-hour initial training, followed by 7 weeks of half-hour follow-up sessions. Youth disseminated messages promoting HIV knowledge and condom use. Result(s):Using generalized estimating equation models, there was a significant reduction over time (P < 0.001) and a significant time by AI arm interaction (P < 0.001) for condomless anal sex act. There was a significant increase in HIV knowledge over time among PCAs in DC and AI arms. Conclusion(s):PCA models that promote HIV knowledge and condom use are efficacious for YEH. Youth are able to serve as a bridge between interventionists and their community. Interventionists should consider working with computer scientists to solve implementation problems.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear what the best strategy is for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among residents of homeless shelters and what individual factors are associated with testing positive for the virus. We sought to evaluate factors associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among residents of homeless shelters and to evaluate positivity rates in shelters where testing was conducted in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks or for surveillance. METHOD(S): We conducted a retrospective chart audit to obtain repeated cross-sectional data from outreach testing done at homeless shelters between Apr. 1 and July 31, 2020, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We compared the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate for shelters where testing was conducted because of an outbreak (at least 1 known case) with those tested for surveillance (no known cases). A patient-level analysis evaluated differences in demographic, health and behavioural characteristics of residents who did and did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2 at shelters with at least 2 positive cases. RESULT(S): One thousand nasopharyngeal swabs were done on 872 unique residents at 20 shelter locations. Among the 504 tests done in outbreak settings, 69 (14%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 1 (0.2%) was indeterminate. Among the 496 tests done for surveillance, 11 (2%) were positive and none were indeterminate. Shelter residents who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were significantly less likely to have a health insurance card (54% v. 72%, p = 0.03) or to have visited another shelter in the last 14 days (0% v. 18%, p < 0.01). There was no association between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and medical history or symptoms. INTERPRETATION: Our findings support testing of asymptomatic shelter residents for SARS-CoV-2 when a positive case is identified at the same shelter. Surveillance testing when there are no known positive cases may detect outbreaks, but further research should identify efficient strategies given scarce testing resources.Copyright © 2021 Joule Inc. or its licensors.

N2  - Background: Young people who inject drugs (PWID) have higher HCV incidence and lower treatment initiation rates compared to their older peers. Novel, simplified care models need to be developed to engage, treat and cure hard to reach patient populations, such as young PWID. Method(s): We present final data from the randomized pilot clinical trial HCV-Seek Test & Rapid Treatment (HCV-ST&RT) for curing HCV in young PWID. Eligible participants were 18-29 years of age, HCV Ab+, treatment naive, and had injected drugs in the past 30 days. Participants were randomized 1:1 to the Rapid Treatment or Usual Care arm. Participants randomized to Rapid Treatment received a same-day medical evaluation, confirmatory and baseline lab testing, and 7-day starter pack of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Participants in Usual Care received same-day HCV confirmatory testing and, if positive, facilitated referral to local providers. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response (SVR12) in RNA+ participant within 12 months of enrollment. Result(s): Among 47 eligible participants, 39 were enrolled. 14/19 in the Rapid Treatment arm and 11/20 in the Usual Care arm were confirmed HCV RNA+ and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Demographics of the RNA+ participants were similar in the two arms with a mean age of 26 years; 21% women; 43% Hispanic and 7% non-Hispanic black. At baseline 14% were homeless, 86% were on medication for opioid use disorder, and participants injected a median of 17 of the last 30 days. In the intentionto-treat analysis, 9/14 (64%) of the Rapid Treatment arm and 2/11 (18%) of the Usual Care arm had confirmed SVR12 (p=0.021). Of the 5 participants in the Rapid Treatment arm who did not achieve SVR12, 1 had treatment failure, 1 never started DAA therapy, 1 had an on-treatment response with pending SVR12 confirmation, and 2 were lost to follow-up. Conclusion(s): Among young HCV RNA+ PWID, significantly higher rates of cure were achieved using the Rapid Treatment model with same day, low-threshold, simplified HCV care compared to facilitated referral. Meeting young PWID where they're at and initiating HCV treatment 'in the moment' without the need for repeat visits appears to be a promising strategy for treating this hard to reach population.

N2  - Background Child poverty rates are increasing in Ireland (24%) and the UK (30%), with children having the highest poverty risk of all ages in Ireland. From 2014-2021 a 211% increase in child homelessness was reported in Ireland, with children accounting for 28% of homeless people in March 2021. Childhood poverty is linked with prematurity, low birth weight, physical and mental ill-health, under-employment, and deprivation. Objectives To assess parental perception of the impact their housing situation, in particular homelessness, had on their child, and to explore the use of primary and emergency healthcare services. Methods We performed a cross-sectional survey in a tertiary paediatric emergency department in Dublin, Ireland. A questionnaire was distributed to parents in triage, who were invited to complete it. Results From 01/11/2020-08/01/2021, 312 questionnaires were completed, with homeless parents (n=14) accounting for 4.5%. Compared to non-homeless, homeless parents were less likely to be Irish (White Irish: 30.8% vs 78.9%; Irish traveller: 15.4% vs 2%; Black: 23.1% vs 4.1%; Asian: 7.7% vs 4.8%; other White: 0% vs 7.5%; p<0.001). Homeless children had higher median GP attendances in the past 6 months (2 vs 1, p=0.033). Compared to nonhomeless, homeless parents were more likely to report their housing situation impacted their ability to keep a GP (23.1% vs 1.5%, p=0.002), scheduling difficulties as reasons for incomplete vaccination (15.4% vs 1.8%, p=0.031), and less likely to be completely vaccinated (71.4% vs 92.4%, p=0.024). Median homelessness duration was 13 months (IQR: 3.8- 27), comprising emergency accommodation (85.7%), direct provision (7.1%), and staying with friends (7.1%). Non-homeless living situations comprised home-owners: 50%; renting: 29.9%; government housing: 8.7%; friends: 10.7%; mobile home: 0.7%. Compared to non-homeless, homeless parents were more likely to report feeling unsafe at home (35.7% vs 3.4%, p<0.001), and concern regarding loosing their home (46.2% vs 8.3%, p<0.001). They were less likely to have cooking facilities (85.7% vs 98.6%, p=0.027), indoor play facilities (35.7% vs 94.4%, p<0.001), or outdoor play facilities (42.9% vs 90%, p<0.001). 28.6% of parents did not have landlord permission to fit safety equipment, with no differences between homeless and non-homeless parents. Compared to non-homeless, homeless parents felt their housing situation negatively impacted their child's play (64.3% vs 17.5%, p<0.001), social development (71.4% vs 14.1%, p<0.001), education (58.3% vs 10.7%, p<0.001), physical health (45.5% vs 11.7, p=0.007), and mental health (61.5% vs 12.6%, p<0.001). There were no differences in terms of age, medical history, self referrals, presenting complaints, ED attendances, and selfperceived healthcare access. Conclusions Irish travellers and non-Irish ethnicities were overrepresented in homeless parents, consistent with national data. Compared to non-homeless, homeless parents were more likely to report over-crowding, feeling unsafe at home, and that their living situation impacted their ability to keep at GP. They were less likely to have cooking or safe play facilities, and their children were less likely to be fully vaccinated. They also felt their housing situation negatively impacted their child's play, social development, education, physical, and mental health. Our study demonstrates the impact of homelessness on all aspects of childhood.

N2  - Objectives: Many LGBTQ homeless youth who are needing clinical care fail to present to care for a multitude of reasons. In this presentation, clinicians will hear firsthand from an LGBTQ youth who has experienced homelessness, tying together the research and data presented thus far with a necessary humanistic perspective. Method(s): Salima Morrow, LMSW, will interview an LGBTQ youth who has experienced homelessness with a focus on sharing their lived experience. Conversation will guide clinicians on how best to care and advocate for LGBTQ homeless youth they may encounter in practice. Result(s): An LGBTQ youth will share their personal story having overcome homelessness with support from CHRIS 180. Ms. Morrow will elicit from the youth ways in which social services and clinicians were helpful during their journey, lending guidance to clinicians to improve care and advocacy for this specific population. Conclusion(s): LGBTQ homeless youth face a multitude of challenges best told by youths themselves. Exploring firsthand the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of one LGBTQ youth who experienced homelessness will help consolidate the data and research presented from panelists throughout the day in addition to providing a strengths-focused and humanistic lens on homeless LGBTQ youth.

N2  - Objectives: The transition from adolescence to adulthood is increasingly complicated in the United States. While a lack of reliable data exists, we do know that youth who have experienced foster care are less likely to pursue a postsecondary education due to challenges experienced while in the foster care system that continue into early adulthood. This presentation will describe factors contributing to those educational challenges, current financial supports that exist for this group of students, and promising practices for improving the network of professionals in Georgia who support youth who have experienced foster care. Method(s): The presenter and a youth co-presenter who has lived experience with foster care and/or homelessness will share responsibility for the presentation. The presenter will discuss factors that impact the opportunity for youth who have experienced foster care to pursue postsecondary education and will include qualitative data collected during a research project in Georgia. The audience will then hear about existing financial and social supports that currently support youth who have experienced foster care, including Education and Training Vouchers (ETV) and the Embark Georgia network. The youth co-presenter will provide feedback from their experience navigating these systems. Potential system improvements and opportunities for policy changes will also be explored. Result(s): Participants will learn about challenges facing foster youth transitioning to adulthood, promising practices, future research and practice opportunities, and policy recommendations. Direct youth feedback will provide invaluable insight into future directions. Conclusion(s): Youth who have experienced foster care endure a host of additional challenges during their transition to adulthood and may require additional supports to be successful in many realms, including postsecondary education. While supports do exist, coordination and alignment are crucial to ensure that these youth can succeed in becoming self-sufficient as adults. Stakeholders are developing promising practices to improve foster youth transition, and more research is needed. FOC, EDUC, COLSTCopyright © 2021

N2  - Objectives: LGBTQ youth are disproportionality affected by homelessness and the multitude of adverse sequalae associated therein. However, there is a paucity of research by and training for child and adolescent psychiatrists on how best to serve these youth. This Clinical Perspectives session will: summarize the pathways to homelessness for LGBTQ youth; chronicle their lived experience, challenges, and resilience; and identify mental health disparities and clinical challenges in caring for these youth. Participants will have the opportunity to hear from mental health advocates and an LGBTQ youth who has experienced homelessness in order to integrate research and data with a humanistic and strengths-based perspective. Method(s): First, Jonathon Wanta, MD, will summarize the existing epidemiological data on the intersectionality of LGBTQ identity and homelessness. Second, Nicholas Forge, PhD, MSW, will summarize his research on the lived experience of and challenges faced by LGBTQ homeless youth on the streets. Third, Mawuena Agbonyitor, MD, will present the mental health and substance use disparities prevalent in LGBTQ youth and provide some clinical expertise, having navigated the many challenges in caring for these individuals. Fourth, Salima Morrow, LMSW, will discuss her experience working with and advocating for LGBTQ homeless youth with CHRIS 180, one of the largest providers of housing for homeless youth in the Atlanta area. Finally, Ms. Morrow will interview a LGBTQ youth who has experienced homelessness to inspire and inform clinicians who may interface with this population. Result(s): Panelists will integrate their research and experience working with LGBTQ homeless youth to bring awareness to the many biopsychosocial risk factors, mental health disparities, and ongoing advocacy work for LGBTQ homeless youth. A guided interview with an LGBTQ youth who has experienced homelessness will inform future practice and identify gaps in supports and services. Conclusion(s): LGBTQ identity and homelessness appear to have a synergistic effect on adverse mental health disparities and substance use, yet many emerge with a strong sense of self and resilience. Further research, clinician training, and advocacy are necessary to deliver a high-level quality of care to these youth. SEX, CC, SPCopyright © 2021

N2  - Objectives: This study reviews the current clinically relevant knowledge on the treatment of substance use disorders (SUD) in adolescents using an equity-informed lens. It identifies populations affected by treatment inequities and evaluates barriers/facilitators to improved treatment access/retention. Method(s): A systematic, librarian-assisted literature search was conducted using MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases, based on terms "substance use" AND "adolescents" AND "treatment" AND "health equity" since 2016. From a yield of 192 articles, 26 studies were retained based on the application of predefined criteria by 2 independent reviewers. Data were synthesized using a content analysis approach and interpreted using an equity lens. Result(s): Most studies are qualitative and mixed methods, examining survey or interview data using thematic analysis. There are 5 longitudinal and experimental studies and no randomized controlled trials. The groups of youth identified as facing inequitable treatment are: justice-involved; LGBTQ+; racial/ethnic minority; Indigenous; homeless; refugee; and those with mental/medical comorbidities. Despite known efficacious treatment (eg, individual and family-based psychosocial interventions), estimates are that less than 9% of adolescents receive and complete treatment. While most studies examine data on, and ways to improve, treatment access compared to treatment retention, important treatment barriers/facilitators are noted. These are multiple and exert influence at policy/system, facility/professional, and family/patient levels. Barriers include variations in treatment quality based on location, inconsistencies in funding, lack of care continuity, and problematic waiting lists. Treatment facilitators include the incorporation of trauma-informed, strength-based, and culturally safe approaches, and the provision of confidential and flexible intervention processes. Conclusion(s): This literature review demonstrates that adolescent SUD remains undertreated and that evaluation of equity as a key feature in treatment studies is lacking. Further, barriers/facilitators to treatment are less well understood for groups experiencing care inequities. This review inspires attention to practice improvement and research development for the equitable treatment of SUD in adolescents. DEI, SUD, TREATCopyright © 2021

N2  - Homelessness is not only a housing issue, it is a complex public health issue resulting in poorer outcomes for health and wellbeing1. To date few solutions for homelessness include the input from key stakeholders (i.e. those who are homeless). Due to the multifaceted impact of homelessness, a systems lens is required to seek solutions. Design thinking or 'human-centred' approaches prioritize collaborative working and valuing user needs2 and feedback. This review considered the current evidence base for the use of design thinking interventions to address homelessness. A systematic scoping review of five databases (Pubmed, ASSIA, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycInfo) and grey databases (Open Grey and Google Scholar) was completed. The titles and abstracts of 1874 articles were independently screened by two reviewers using Covidence software and full-text screening of 103 papers was achieved. In total we include 9 studies for data extraction and a narrative review of emergent evidence is reported. Evidence from four countries: USA (5); Australia (2); Canada (1) and South Africa (1) was identified. Of the nine studies included, design thinking interventions were adopted for health, housing and employment solutions and included different population groups namely homeless families, youths and adults. Described interventions present evidence from early engagement of users to production of low fidelity prototyping with positive outcomes. Design thinking processes offer inclusive and collaborative methods2. Preliminary evidence from this review confirms the importance of engaging the experience of users i.e.'homeless populations' in seeking and developing solutions to empower and support their pathways out of homelessness.

N2  - Background: Transgender adolescents experience staggering rates of peer and family rejection, victimization, discrimination and homelessness. Gender diversity consists of multiple dimensions including gender identity, contentedness, and conformity. A recent study found that stress processes impacting transgender youth may also impact youth with broad gender diversity including those with felt genders that are not fully aligned with their sex assigned at birth. This study examines the relationship between gender diversity and reward processing during the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task. Adversity and stress have been shown to be related to neural activation blunting. We hypothesize that due to greater minority stress, gender-diverse children will have less activation during the MID task. Method(s): Data were from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (NDA release 3.0). Gender diversity was operationalized as the average score on the ABCD youth gender measure. Gender-diverse youth were case matched with gender-typical youth (N=4,294). Analysis examined how gender diversity impacts neural activation during anticipation and loss of reward after controlling for demographic covariates, using PALM. Result(s): Dimensional gender-diversity was associated with deactivation in the transverse frontopolar gyri and sulci during anticipation of large loss. There were no activation differences during anticipation of reward. Conclusion(s): Gender-diverse youth have less activation in frontal areas associated with higher-order integration of information. This is consistent with blunted neural responses previously reported to be associated with stress.

N2  - Background: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are associated with increased risk of medical, mental health, and behavioral problems. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends ACE screening, management, and prevention for toxic stress. However, many pediatricians are not screening in part due to uncertainty of families' responses and fear of jeopardizing relationships. Because quantitative studies of parent and patient perceptions of ACE screening have not been performed in pediatric populations, this study aims to address this gap. Method(s): This study examined the relationship between ACE score and parent/patient perception of screening in two pediatric clinics at Phoenix Children's Hospital: a general pediatrics primary care academic practice (GP) and a homeless youth outreach practice (HYO). The ACE screening tool in this study was modified from the Center for Youth Wellness version to include parent/patient perception on a 5-point Likert rating scale. The screen was given annually to parents or caregivers at preventive care visits, and to both parents and patients at age 13. A total of 2,887 surveys were completed between September 2018 and November 2019. Result(s): Patients at the HYO clinic had higher average ACE scores than those at the GP clinic [GP: 0.81 (parent-reported), 1.45 (patient-reported) vs. HYO: 2.70 (parentreported), 5.15 (patient-reported), p<0.001]. A greater proportion of positive parent and patient ratings were seen at the GP clinic vs. HYO clinic (p<0.001), although the majority of responses were positive for all groups (GP parents vs. patients 87.4% vs. 77.7%, HYO parents vs. patients 78.9% vs. 65%). Patients at the GP clinic with negative perceptions had higher ACE scores (p=0.02). There was no significant correlation between parent or patient reported ACE scores and parent perception (Spearman's Rho -0.08, p=0.44 and -0.09, p=0.33). However, there was a small negative correlation between both patient and parent ACE scores and patient perception (Spearman's Rho -0.23, p=0.01 and -0.21, p=0.02). Conclusion(s): Most parents and patients had a positive perception of screening. There was no correlation between ACE score and parent perception of screening, which may alleviate concerns about negatively impacting professional relationships. Further research is needed to determine how to increase teenagers' perceptions when answering these sensitive questions.

N2  - Background: Housing instability is dened by experiencing at least one of four circumstances in the past 12months: two or more moves, inability to pay rent/mortgage/utilities, needing to stay with others due todiffculty paying bills, or a history of homelessness. Children subjected to housing instability are more likely tohave poorer physical health, exacerbated chronic conditions, behavioral problems, and increasedhospitalizations. Children entering foster care also tend to have poorer mental and physical health incomparison to children who have never been in foster care. A study of housing needs of grandparentcaregivers concluded that, "poverty and nancial strain was found to be the overarching threat to securingand maintaining safe, affordable housing that is suitable for raising grandchildren." Hypothesis: Wehypothesized that kinship caregivers of youth enrolled in the Care4Kids (C4K) program were more likely toacknowledge having circumstances associated with housing instability and were more likely to accept housingresources. Aim(s): Assess the rate of housing instability of families/caregivers of foster children enrolled inCare4Kids Foster Care Medical Home Program. Offer community resources (directed toward addressinghousing needs) to caregivers identied as having housing instability. Compare rates of housing instability fordifferent categories of caregivers. Method(s): Triweekly review of the Care4Kids database to identify childrenenrolled in the C4K program who met criteria for study inclusion (removed from and placed in MilwaukeeCounty). The study included children that entered foster care, changed placement, or re-enrolled in C4Kbetween July and December 2019. Caregivers of identied children were interviewed regarding movefrequency, inability to pay rent/mortgage/utilities, needing to stay with others due to diffculty paying bills, andhistory of homelessness in the past 12 months, as a part of the introduction to Care4Kids. Survey data wasentered and stored into a RedCap database. Caregivers who screened positively for housing instability wereoffered a referral to the Children's Community Health Plan housing navigator. Caregivers who did not screenpositively were also able to request and receive a housing referral. Result(s): From July-December 2019, 161caregivers were surveyed (86% consented to participation). There were 47 homes where multiple eligiblechildren resided. 68/138 (49%) consenting caregivers were kinship caregivers, 63 (46%) were non-relativecaregivers, and 7 (5%) were reunied caregivers. 15 kinship, 1 non-relative and 3 reunied caregivers screenedpositively for housing instability; 4 kinship and 3 reunied caregivers desired referrals to housing resources.13 caregivers (7 kinship and 6 non-relative) did not screen positively for housing instability but desired ahousing referral. Conclusion(s): Housing instability was most common for kinship caregivers. Since morecaregivers requesting housing referral had a negative screen for housing instability, the screening tool maynot be the optimal for identifying those families truly needing support.

T1  - Development of a screening tool for social determinants of health at a federally qualified health center
T3  - 2020 AAP National Conference and Exhibition Meeting. Virtual.
A1  - Hunt A. 
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Background: Adverse social conditions in childhood contribute to an increased burden of acute and chronic disease in adult life. Childhood exposure to poverty, financial stress, food insecurity, housing instability, and poor housing quality is associated with stress, academic and cognitive deficits, socio-emotional diffculties, and poor health status. Screening for social determinants of health (SDH) in pediatric practices increases referrals to community-based resources, decreases social needs, and improves parent-reported child health. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) therefore recommends screening for SDH at every health supervision visit from birth until age 21. However, there is no consensus regarding the best SDH screening tool. The lack of consensus exists because SDH are context dependent, family needs vary between communities, and screening program effectiveness is impacted by what resources are available to act on positive screens. These barriers to standardization leave room for personalization of screening by pediatric providers. Methodology: The Eric B. Chandler Health Center (EBCHC) is a federally qualified health center in New Brunswick, New Jersey. To assess the social needs of pediatric patients at EBCHC, a SDH screening tool was developed. Thetool was designed as paper handout with a series of "yes-no" questions, assessing families' interest inresources related to eight SDH (see gure 1). A series of plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles were then begun tooptimize the tool for the EBCHC pediatric patient population. The tool was administered to families at well-child visits and feedback was elicited from families, physicians, social workers, and community health workers.The tool was then revised and another cycle begun. Throughout implementation, positive screens (>=1 "yes"response) were referred to the EBCHC community health worker, who provided resources and/or counseling. Discussion(s): Overall, information on school training and health insurance were the most desired resources.Reflective of this trend, school training and health insurance were the most commonly desired resourcesamong Spanish-speaking patients. Among English-speaking patients, however, diapers and children's clothingwere most commonly desired. After repeated PDSA cycles, a transition to an electronic medical record (EMR)-based tool was proposed to enable ICD-10 coding of responses. To facilitate the paper-to-EMR transition, thetool was changed to a modified version of the Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patient Assets, Risks,and Experiences (PRAPARE) screening tool (see gure 2). A trial of this tool is currently underway. Conclusion(s):The PDSA cycles performed during this project exemplify the importance of interdisciplinary input in designingSDH screening tools. Feedback from families and allied healthcare providers allowed optimization of the SDHscreening for the target population and interdisciplinary collaboration enabled linkage between screening andreferral for services. As the EMR-based tool is implemented, it will facilitate collection of longitudinal data thatwill be used to further improve screening.

N2  - Introduction: Shelter and food are two core determinants of health. Food insecurity has been linked to poorhealth outcomes. Since enactment of the National School Lunch Act in 1946, free and discounted school mealshave been available for children and youth of low-income families. The goal of this research was to assesssocial factors that influence enrollment of housing insecure youths into these programs. Method(s): Youth HopeFoundation provides housing, food, clothing, and education to homeless, runaway, and at-risk youth9.Participants were surveyed by Youth Hope case managers between 2009 and 2019. Information obtainedinclude demographics, social history, and current needs. Survey responses were input into a database foranalysis. Data: There were 834 who identified as currently enrolled in school and were aged 19 and younger.Of these youths, 565 were receiving free school lunches and 127 were not receiving free school lunches (136had no response). Two populations were compared: participants receiving free lunches, and those who werenot receiving free lunches. Data from this study revealed that students born outside California were less likely to receive free lunch (P=0.02). Physical, sexual, mental, and emotional abuse did not significantly impactenrollment in free lunch programs. Interestingly, students with history of verbal abuse cwere more likely toreceive free lunch (P=0.03). Those who were never abused also were more likely to receive free lunch (P=0.03).Participants who sleep at their parents' homes and those who lived in boys' and girls' clubs were more likely toreceive free lunches (P= 0.03 and P= 0.02, respectively). Other housing history (ran away in the past, living onthe streets, or currently living at other locations) did not significantly affect enrollment in free lunch programs.Racial delineations revealed that Caucasian participants were less likely to be enrolled in free lunch programs(P=0.002), and Hispanic participants were more likely to be enrolled in free lunch programs (0.0001). All otherracial groups did not show significant differences in the two populations (receiving vs. not receiving freelunch). Conclusion(s): Our data suggests that sleeping arrangements, history of abuse, being born outsideCalifornia. and racial delineations play a factor in whether youths receive free lunches in San BernardinoCounty. Children who are housing insecure and stop in at shelters are more likely to be food insecure, and ourdata indicates that further work needs to be done to better understand barriers to enrollment in free schoollunch programs.

N2  - Purpose: The more than 40,000 individuals who make up the homeless adolescent and young adult population on any given night in the United States face high rates of morbidity and mortality, with a life expectancy of thirty years less than the national average. With three times greater odds of poor health care access than their peers, homeless youth are often uninsured and rely heavily on emergency rooms for medical care. In an effort to improve health care accessibility and decrease inequities, the current quality improvement initiative's SMART aim was to increase, by 10% from baseline, the percent of a sheltered homeless youth cohort who have enrolled, or submitted applications to enroll, in a health insurance plan or the county's healthcare financial assistance program (HFAP) within 21 days of intake into the shelter program. Method(s): An initial needs assessment was conducted through key stakeholder interviews, baseline data collection, process mapping, and the development of key driver and fishbone diagrams. Outcome measures, including insurance status and enrollment in the local health system's HFAP, were tracked weekly for homeless persons, aged 18 to 24 years, residing at a transitional housing program during the study period of January 2019 to April 2019. During this time, Plan Do Study Action (PDSA) cycle interventions included: 1) adoption of insurance documentation protocols in the shelter-based medical home, and 2) implementation of monthly Financial Assistance Program eligibility events on-site at the shelter facility. Duration from shelter intake to submission of HFAP application and satisfaction of the process from shelter service providers and youth were reported as process and balancing measures. Result(s): Chart review of fifty-six youth who had entered the housing program between September 2017 and January 2019 provided baseline information. Sixty-two youth entered post-intervention between January 2019 and April 2019. The adoption of insurance documentation protocols with PDSA cycle #1 lead to a significant increase in insurance status documentation to 56.5% (35/62; Z=3.65, p=0.00054) of medical records, compared with 25% (14/56) prior to the intervention. Thirty youth participated in HFAP eligibility events established with PDSA cycle #2; of those youth, 87.6% had a documented pre-existing health care need. The percent of insured or HFAP-applied residents increased significantly from a baseline average of 4% of residents per week (11/277), to 33% (76/233; Z=8.57, p=0.00001) in the month following PDSA cycle #1, and 39% (258/667; Z=10.76, p=0.00001) over two months following PDSA cycle #2. By the second HFAP eligibility event, 80% of participants submitted HFAP applications within 1 month of enrollment in the housing program. Conclusion(s): Insurance documentation protocols and a novel collaboration with the county health department, improved the ability of one transitional housing program's medical home to recognize and rapidly respond to the uninsured status of homeless youth. These interventions provide a unique model for other programs aiming to reduce health care access inequities among underserved populations. Sources of Support: NoneCopyright © 2020

N2  - Purpose: Data suggest a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 illness and death among racial and ethnic minorities in the US and that SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic is likely to result in delayed access to HIV treatment, preventive care, and research study visits designed to increase uptake of services. Scant data examine this relationship among Black and Latinx Sexual and Gender Minority Youth (BLSGMY). We examine the COVID-19 vulnerabilities experienced in a sample of BLSGMY enrolled in a randomized control trial (RCT). Method(s): 182 BLSGMY, age 15-24, who are at-risk for or living with HIV are enrolled in an RCT in Baltimore, MD; Washington, DC; and Philadelphia, PA. Data was reviewed to examine impact of COVID-19 on completing scheduled study visits. Participants due for a study visit were contacted via telephone, video or text messaging to determine the impact of COVID-19 on their life. Participants were asked about overall well-being, coping and information/resources needed during this time. Data collection is on-going. Result(s): At the start of COVID, the mean age 21.6 (SD ), with 86% cisgender male, 43% unemployed and 24% unstably housed. 90 participants were due for a study visit between March - July, 2020. 49 (56.3%) had a delayed study visit (outside their follow up window). We contacted 35 participants who had a delay in their study visit to see how they were impacted by COVID-19. Most (n=32, 90%) described being impacted by COVID-19. Nearly half (n=17, 48%) described economic (e.g., loss of employment, food insecurity, and housing instability), 38% (n=13) described emotional (e.g., fear of COVID-19 exposure, isolation, stress, worry about their health and the future), 14% (n=5) described educational (e.g., difficulty navigating online courses) and 10% (n=4) described medical (e.g., delay in care/medications) impacts and requesting support to be testing. Only 3 participants sought testing, with one diagnosed with COVID-19. Two participants described increased unprotected anal intercourse, with one voicing concern about exposure, and one participant described social isolation which contributed to decreased risky behavior, including fewer sexual partners and decreased marijuana use. Participants were referred to food, unemployment, and medical resources. Conclusion(s): This work supports findings that COVID-19 significantly impacts BLSGMY by further increasing social and emotional vulnerabilities in an already vulnerable population. In order to address the COVID pandemic, programs that address COVID will need be able to simultaneously focus on low testing engagement and the pre-COVID vulnerabilities (e.g., unstable housing, high unemployment, and poor access to care) that BLSGMY already face.

N2  - Purpose: Violence is a serious public health issue with myriad short- and long-term impacts on development and health outcomes. Violence victimization can present as many typologies (e.g., physical, psychological, sexual) and from different perpetrators (e.g., intimate partners, parents, peers). The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and typologies of violence victimization among an online recruited sample of sexually active adolescent substance users in southern metropolitan areas. Method(s): This study aimed to recruit adolescents aged 13-17 years who reported being sexually active, having a history of substance use, and residing in one of five Southern metropolitan areas with high HIV incidence (Atlanta, GA; Columbia, SC; Jackson, MS; Jacksonville, FL; Memphis TN). Respondents were recruited online from January to March 2019 through social networking platforms, and 101 eligible adolescents were enrolled. The average age at baseline was 16.3 (SD=0.9) years. Result(s): At baseline, 65.3% (n=66) of adolescents reported prior victimization of at least one typology (physical, verbal, emotional, sexual, and neglect). Verbal (53.5%, n=54) and emotional (48.5%, n=49) abuse were the most commonly reported, followed by physical abuse (20.8%, n=21), sexual abuse (16.8%, n=17), and neglect (10.9%, n=11). The majority of respondents (72.7%, n=48) reported experiencing more than one type of victimization. Specific to intimate partner violence (IPV), 29.7% (n=30) of respondents reported prior victimization. The most common form of IPV experienced was sexual coercion (26.7%, n=27) followed by sexual assault/rape (13.9%, n=14) and physical violence (9.9%, n=10). Eleven (10.9%) respondents indicated their first sexual experience was by force or without consent. Differences in violence victimization were observed by respondents' demographic characteristics. Biological females more frequently reported experiences of emotional abuse (p=.002), sexual abuse (p=.048), sexual coercion from a partner (p=.047), and any form of IPV (p=.048) as compared to biological males. Sexual and gender minority (SGM) adolescents more frequently reported verbal abuse (p=.036), sexual coercion from a partner (p=.035), and any form of IPV (p =.013) as compared to non-SGM adolescents. Adolescents with prior experiences of homelessness more frequently reported physical abuse (p=.005), verbal abuse (p=.005), emotional abuse (p=.018), and neglect (p=.003) as compared to adolescents with stable housing. Conclusion(s): Experiences of violence victimization were pervasive among this sample of high-risk adolescents. SGM adolescents and adolescents with experiences of homelessness disproportionately reported prior victimization, similar to other studies showing a greater burden of victimization among females, SGM, and other vulnerable youth. Public health and medicine professionals should increase efforts to discuss violence prevention, reporting, and resources with young people at an early age, especially more vulnerable children and young people. In line with findings from this study showing that adolescents prefer online and technology-based modalities for interventions and service delivery, innovative prevention interventions and communication campaigns are also needed to address and prevent violence victimization, particularly IPV, among adolescents via commonly used digital channels and platforms.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate whether housing instability is associated with differences in prenatal care utilization and perinatal outcomes. Study Design: In this observational cohort study, women were surveyed during their postpartum hospitalization regarding housing instability during pregnancy and their medical records were reviewed. Women were considered housing unstable if they answered affirmatively to at least one of six screening items (Figure). The primary outcome was adequacy of prenatal care measured by the Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization index, comparing adequate or intermediate care versus inadequate care. Secondary maternal outcomes were gestational weight gain, cesarean delivery, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; neonatal outcomes were preterm birth, large for gestational age status, and NICU transfer. Propensity scoring was performed using sociodemographic and clinical covariates. Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for propensity score weighting. Result(s): In this cohort (N=489), 11.0% (N=54) experienced housing instability during pregnancy. Unstably housed women were more likely to be minority race, have less than a college education, be single, be unemployed and have had a prior preterm birth. Unstably housed women were more likely to have had inadequate prenatal care (16.7% vs 3.9%, p<0.001), but findings were not significant after propensity score adjustment (Table). There was no statistically significant association with maternal or neonatal secondary outcomes. Conclusion(s): One in 10 women in this urban population experienced housing instability during pregnancy. Housing instability appears to be a risk marker that is related to other social determinants of health; however, in this population, it does not appear to be an independent risk factor for inadequate prenatal care or other perinatal outcomes. Given the range of housing instability experiences, future research must investigate specific types of housing instability and the potential perinatal consequences.

N2  - In this chapter, I examine how homeless young people (HYP) constructed a social space - the street field - that helped them in various ways to survive on the streets. The street field comprised peers who devised certain ways to generate incomes, secure physical protection, and emotional support. To access these resources, HYP were required to follow certain norms that operated the field: norms of membership, trust and reciprocity, and expulsion. These norms ensured the existence of the field contingent on which was the survival of HYP. The field enabled HYP to engage in erotic dancing and sex work to earn financial capital important to meet quotidian needs. This analysis demonstrates that HYP displayed agency within significant structural constraints, but the types of works they performed reproduced their social disadvantage.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this paper is to explore government service usage across the domains of health, justice, and social development and tax for a cohort of formerly homeless people in Aotearoa New Zealand, focusing specifically on the experiences of women. The Integrated Data Infrastructure is used, which links our de-identified cohort data with administrative data from various Aotearoa New Zealand Government departments. Result(s): Of the cohort of 390, the majority (53.8%) were women. These women were more likely to be younger (57.1% were aged 25-44), indigenous Maori (78.6%), and have children (81.4%). These women had lower incomes, and higher rates of welfare benefit receipt, when compared to men in the cohort and a control group of women from the wider population. Conclusion(s): The cohort were primarily female, younger, Maori, and parents. They earned much less than their non-homeless counterparts, and relied heavily on government support. The neoliberalisation of the welfare state, high rates of women's poverty, and the gendered nature of parenthood means that women's homelessness is distinct from men's homelessness.Copyright © 2021 The Authors

N2  - Background: Adolescence is considered the second most critical and the second most vulnerable developmental period in the lifespan. Life in institutional care settings has both positive and negative consequences on adolescents' life. Aim of this study is to explore the quality of life of homeless female adolescents residing in shelter institutions. Design(s): A qualitative research design was used. Sample: a purposive sample of 15 homeless female adolescents who reside in a shelter institution were selected. Setting(s): The study was conducted at New Women Mabarah Association, Cairo, Egypt. Method(s): two methods for data collection were used; Homeless Female Adolescents Structured Questionnaire & Homeless Female Adolescents Semi-Structured Interview. Result(s): in relation to components of quality of life (QOL) for homeless female adolescents, education and safety constituted the main components of QOL (73.33% & 26.66% respectively). The lived experience of homeless female adolescents' indicated that education was very important as it will help them achieve a better future. Female adolescents in the institution believed that their QOL is negatively affected by lack of medical services and limited freedom. However, it seems that relationship among adolescents provides some sort of reciprocal psychological support and enhances within the institution independence. Conclusion(s): adolescents in the institution have a lot of rules and regulations they have to abide by in order to have reasonable QOL.Copyright © 2021 Lahore Medical And Dental College.

N2  - Background: Veteran family homelessness is a significant issue, yet little is known about the needs and barriers to services of veteran families experiencing homelessness. This qualitative study examined the experiences, needs, and barriers to services among homeless-experienced veteran families to inform providers for this important population. Method(s): Twenty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted from February through September 2016 with 18 veteran parents with a recent history of homelessness (9 mothers, 9 fathers), and 7 homeless service providers throughout Los Angeles County. The "Sector Wheel for Under-Resourced Populations" data elicitation approach was used to conduct the interviews, which allowed the participant to guide the interview by discussing different sectors of a family's life affected by homelessness. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and themes were coded with Atlas.ti. Result(s): Interviews revealed parenting stress and worsening family mental health during homelessness. Participants described barriers to navigating housing, social, and health services with children, including not knowing where to seek help, difficulty connecting to health and social services in the community, and a lack of family-focused services. Parents encountered discrimination by landlords and lack of access to permanent housing in safe neighborhoods. Conclusion(s): Findings demonstrate a need for delivering family-centered and comprehensive services to homeless-experienced veteran families that recognize the multifaceted needs of this population. Advocacy initiatives are needed to address discrimination against veterans experiencing family homelessness and increase access to affordable permanent housing in safe neighborhoods for families.Copyright © 2021 American Board of Family Medicine.

N2  - Background. Malnutrition is a major public health problem and most enveloping cause of morbidity and mortality among children and adolescents throughout the world. This study was aimed at assessing the nutritional status and associated factors among 6-10-year-old children in selected earthquake-affected areas of Gorkha district, Nepal. Methods. A community-based cross-sectional study among 420 mothers having children of age groups 6-10 years (with anthropometric measurement among children) was conducted using a mixed method in selected earthquake-affected areas of Gorkha district, Nepal, from October 2015 to April 2016. Gorkha was selected purposively from 14 earthquake-affected districts. Two village development committees were selected randomly among 6 having severe impact. Randomly, 5 wards were selected from each of the 2 village development committees. As the sample was 420, 42 children were selected randomly from every ward. Result. Among the 420 children, 31.9% were underweight, 51.9% were stunted, and 2.9% were wasted after the earthquake. Children who were more prone to being underweight were the following: male children (RR=1.34 95% CI: 1.01-1.78) and children from illiterate mothers (RR=2.49, 95% CI: 1.85-3.36), illiterate fathers (RR=1.73, 95% CI: 1.32-2.27), and homemaker mothers (RR=0.28, 95% CI: 0.20-0.38); children whose families were using nonimproved sources of water (RR=2.60, 95% CI: 1.07-6.60); and households having food insecurity (RR=12.97, 95% CI: 3.29-51.18). Similarly, children of illiterate fathers (RR=1.67, 95% CI: 1.41-1.97), children of illiterate mothers (RR=2.32, 95% CI: 1.91-2.83), children of homemaker mothers (RR=0.59, 95% CI: 0.49-0.70), children whose family were using treated water (RR=0.32, 95% CI: 0.15-0.67), and children from food insecure households (RR=10.52, CI: 4.05-27.33) were found to be stunted. After adjustment, children from households consuming nonimproved water were 6 times more likely (OR=6.75; 95% CI: 1.59-28.62) to be wasted. Conclusion. Illiterate mothers, illiterate fathers, mothers engaged in occupation other than household work, and food insecure households were found to be independent predictors of underweight and stunting. Nonimproved source of drinking water was found to be independent predictors of wasting.Copyright © 2020 Asmita Shrestha et al.

N2  - Use of alternative tobacco products, as well as regular cigarettes, is widespread among unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness. However, little is known about their level of motivation for quitting use of these products, factors associated with motivation to quit, or how these might vary by type of tobacco product. Unaccompanied homeless youth were sampled from 25 street and service sites in Los Angeles County (N=469). All participants were past month tobacco users who completed a survey on their tobacco-related behaviors and cognitions, including motivation to quit, as well as background characteristics. Among self-reported users of each product, motivation to quit in the next 30 days was highest for regular cigarettes (33%), followed by e-cigarettes/vaporizers (30%), little cigars/cigarillos (25%), cigars (20%), and natural cigarettes (20%). Between 33 and 49% of youth, depending on product, were not thinking about quitting at all. Correlates of lower motivation to quit differed somewhat by product type, with the most consistent being race, more frequent use, lower perceived riskiness of the product, and using the product because of its good taste or smell. Results from this study identify a set of psychosocial and behavioral factors, some that are common across tobacco products and others that are product-specific, that may be particularly important to address in efforts to reduce tobacco use among youth experiencing homelessness. Future regulations on the sale of flavored tobacco products may also serve to increase motivation to quit in this population.

T1  - Household food insecurity and early childhood development: Longitudinal evidence from Ghana

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The burden of food insecurity is large in Sub-Saharan Africa, yet the evidence-base on the relation between household food insecurity and early child development is extremely limited. Furthermore, available research mostly relies on cross-sectional data, limiting the quality of existing evidence. We use longitudinal data on preschool-aged children and their households in Ghana to investigate how being in a food insecure household was associated with early child development outcomes across three years. Household food insecurity was measured over three years using the Household Hunger Score. Households were first classified as "ever food insecure" if they were food insecure at any round. We also assessed persistence of household food insecurity by classifying households into three categories: (i) never food insecure; (ii) transitory food insecurity, if the household was food insecure only in one wave; and (iii) persistent food insecurity, if the household was food insecure in two or all waves. Child development was assessed across literacy, numeracy, social-emotional, short-term memory, and self-regulation domains. Controlling for baseline values of each respective outcome and child and household characteristics, children from ever food insecure households had lower literacy, numeracy and short-term memory. When we distinguished between transitory and persistent food insecurity, transitory spells of food insecurity predicted decreased numeracy (beta = -0.176, 95% CI: -0.317; -0.035), short-term memory (beta = -0.237, 95% CI: -0.382; -0.092), and self-regulation (beta = -0.154, 95% CI: -0.326; 0.017) compared with children from never food insecure households. By contrast, children residing in persistently food insecure households had lower literacy scores (beta = -0.243, 95% CI: -0.496; 0.009). No gender differences were detected. Results were broadly robust to the inclusion of additional controls. This novel evidence from a Sub-Saharan African country highlights the need for multi-sectoral approaches including social protection and nutrition to support early child development.Copyright © 2020 Aurino et al.

N2  - Introduction: Food security is a problem in developing countries. Food insecure household usually adopted coping strategies. Therefore, this study aim to analyse the correlation of household food security and coping strategies in food insecure area. Method(s): This cross sectional study were done in Bangkalan District, Madura Island, Indonesia which included 200 households having children under five. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the household characteristics and coping strategies. The food security status was assessed by Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). Correlation data was analysed by Chi-square test. Result(s): The prevalence of household food insecure was 67.5%. As much as 41% was mildly food insecure, 20.5% moderately food insecure and 6% severly food insecure. The popular coping strategy was borrowing food/money from friends and relatives (34.5%) and eating less-preferred foods (21.5%). The household coping strategy was correlated with household food security status (p<0.001). The more severe food insecurity status the higher proportion of coping strategies adopted. Conclusion(s): High prevalent of food insecure household in food insecure area. Social capital become an important factor in combating food insecurity. Targeted activities or beneficials are recommended in order to alleviate the burden of food insecurity in this area.Copyright © 2020, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

N2  - Interventionists often prioritize quantitative evaluation criteria such as design (e.g., randomized controlled trials), delivery fidelity, and outcome effects to assess the success of an intervention. Albeit important, criteria such as these obscure other key metrics of success such as the role of the interactions between participants and intervention deliverers, or contextual factors that shape an intervention's activities and outcomes. In line with advocacy to expand evaluation criteria for health interventions, we designed this qualitative study to examine how a subsample of Black men in MEN Count, an HIV/STI risk reduction and healthy relationship intervention with employment and housing stability case management for Black men in Washington, DC, defined the intervention's success. We also examined the contextual factors that shaped participation in the study's peer counseling sessions. We conducted structured interviews with 38 Black men, ages 18 to 60 years (M = 31.1, SD = 9.33) who completed at least one of three peer counseling sessions. Analyses highlighted three key themes: (a) the favorable impact of Mr. Stroman, the lead peer counselor, on participants' willingness to participate in MEN Count and disclose their challenges-we dubbed this the "Stroman Effect"; (b) the importance of Black men intervention deliverers with relatable life experiences; and (c) how contextual factors such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic, needs for housing and employment services and safe spaces to talk about challenges, and absentee fathers shaped participation. We discuss the study's implications for sustainable programs after funding ends and future multilevel health interventions to promote health equity for poor urban Black men.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is much more prevalent among young people experiencing homelessness than in the general population of adolescents and young adults. Although many young homeless smokers are motivated to quit, there are no empirically-evaluated smoking cessation programs for this population. It is important that any such program address the factors known to be associated with quitting-related outcomes among homeless young people, to provide ongoing support in a way that accommodates the mobility of this population, and does not rely on scarce service provider resources for its delivery. The objective of this project is to develop and pilot test a text messaging-based intervention (TMI), as an adjunct to brief cessation counseling and provision of nicotine patches, to help homeless young people who want to quit smoking. METHODS/DESIGN: This pilot study will utilize a cluster cross-over randomized controlled design with up to 80 current smokers who desire to quit and are recruited from three drop-in centers serving young people experiencing homelessness in the Los Angeles area. All participants will be provided with a minimum standard of care: a 30-min group-based smoking cessation counseling session and free nicotine replacement. Half of these smokers will then also receive the TMI, as an adjunct to this standard care, which will provide 6 weeks of ongoing support for quitting. This support includes continued and more intensive education regarding nicotine dependence, quitting smoking, and relapse; does not require additional agency resources; can be available "on demand" to users; and includes features to personalize the quitting experience. This study will investigate whether receiving the TMI adjunct to standard smoking cessation care results in greater reductions in cigarette smoking compared to standard care alone over a 3-month period. DISCUSSION: This study has the potential to address an important gap in the clinical research literature on cigarette smoking cessation and provide empirical support for using a TMI to provide ongoing assistance and support for quitting among young smokers experiencing homelessness.

N2  - We document a tendency to demean others' needs: believing that psychological needs-those requiring mental capacity, and hence more uniquely human (e.g., need for meaning and autonomy)-are relatively less important to others compared with physical needs-those shared with other biological agents, and hence more animalistic (e.g., need for food and sleep). Because valuing psychological needs requires a sophisticated humanlike mind, agents presumed to have relatively weaker mental capacities should also be presumed to value psychological needs less compared with biological needs. Supporting this, our studies found that people demeaned the needs of nonhuman animals (e.g., chimpanzees) and historically dehumanized groups (e.g., drug addicts) more than the needs of close friends or oneself (Studies 1 and 3). Because mental capacities are more readily recognized through introspection than by external observation, people also demean peers' needs more than their own, inferring that one's own behavior is guided more strongly by psychological needs than identical behavior in others (Study 4). Two additional experiments suggest that demeaning could be a systematic error (Studies 5 and 6), as charity donors and students underestimated the importance of homeless people's psychological (vs. physical) needs compared with self-reports and choices from homeless people. Underestimating the importance of others' psychological needs could impair the ability to help others. These experiments indicate that demeaning is a unique facet of dehumanization reflecting a reliable, consequential, and potentially mistaken understanding of others' minds.

N2  - BACKGROUND: People living in temporary housing for long periods after a disaster are at risk of poor mental health. This study investigated the post-disaster incidence and remission of common mental disorders among adults living in temporary housing for the 3 years following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. METHOD(S): Three years after the disaster, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 1089 adult residents living in temporary housing in the disaster area, i.e., the shelter group, and a random sample of 852 community residents from non-disaster areas of East Japan. The World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to diagnose DSM-IV mood, anxiety, and alcohol use disorders. Information on demographic variables and disaster experiences was also collected. RESULT(S): Response rates were 49 and 46% for the shelter group and the community residents, respectively. The incidence of mood/anxiety disorder in the shelter group was elevated only in the first year post-disaster compared to that of the general population. The rate of remission for mood and anxiety disorders was significantly lower in the shelter group than in the community residents. The proportion seeking medical treatment was higher in the shelter group. CONCLUSION(S): The onset of common mental disorders increased in the first year, but then levelled off in the following years among residents in temporary housing after the disaster. Remission from incident post-disaster mental disorders was slower in the shelter group than in the general population. Post-disaster mental health service could consider the greater incidence in the first year and prolonged remission of mental disorders among survivors with a long-term stay in temporary housing after a disaster.

N2  - Background: Individuals at high-risk for trafficking are often subject to preexisting complex trauma that only intensifies during the trafficking experience. This greatly increases their risk of mental illness, although the actual prevalence of mental health disorders in children who are sex trafficked remains unclear. Objective(s): To examine the prevalence of mental health diagnoses among a sample of youth identified as being sex trafficked, and to discuss these rates in relation to other high-risk groups reported in the literature. Participants and setting: 143 female and male child trafficking victims in Wisconsin. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed individual medical records, identifying mental health diagnoses and behaviors. The results were compared to summarized prevalence data for mental health disorders in sex trafficked, runaway children, juvenile offenders, and foster care children identified via a scoping review. Result(s): We observed significantly higher rates of ADHD (52.4%, p < 0.0001), bipolar disorder (26.6%, p < 0.0001), and PTSD (19.6%, p < 0.05 to p < 0.0001) in our sample of trafficked youth compared to all high-risk groups, as well as for depression (45.5%), anxiety (19.6%), conduct disorder (19.6%), ODD (25.9%), and psychosis (14.0%) relative to multiple groups individually. Conclusion(s): The complex trauma suffered by child survivors of sex trafficking can impart numerous effects with overlapping symptomatology of many mental health disorders. Survivors' adaptive responses to complex trauma may lead to improper diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders at the expense of prompt access to trauma-focused therapies. Alternative diagnoses and treatments of this complex dysfunction are discussed.Copyright © 2019

N2  - Background: Homelessness among youth is devastating, with high rates of substance use disorders and mental health comorbidity. Mindfulness-based interventions that include meditation and mindfulness skills training reduce stress and symptoms of anxiety or depression. However, engaging high-risk youth in interventions is challenging. Virtual reality is a more flexible platform for delivering meditation and may be appealing to youth. Objective(s): The study objectives were to evaluate the feasibility of delivering virtual reality meditation and of collecting outcome measures, including anxiety and physiologic stress. Method(s): A sample of 30 youth experiencing homelessness was enrolled in the study. Youth were randomized to receive 10 minutes of one of three interventions: (1) virtual reality meditation, (2) audio meditation (through a web-based platform), or (3) virtual reality imagery of historical pictures and text. Subjects who consented to the study attended two research visits. The first visit collected survey measures of demographics, mental health, and substance use, and oriented subjects to the intervention platforms. The second visit (1-3 days later) delivered the intervention and collected pre and post outcome measures of anxiety and physiologic stress (salivary cortisol). Changes in anxiety and cortisol at the second visit were compared across groups using a linear regression model in which the primary analysis compared virtual reality meditation to audio meditation and secondary analyses compared virtual reality meditation to virtual reality imagery. Result(s): Anxiety scores decreased in all groups, with a larger reduction among the virtual reality meditation group (difference=10.8) compared to the web-based meditation or virtual reality images groups (difference=5.8 and 5.0, respectively). After controlling for baseline values, there were no significant group differences in changes in anxiety scores or cortisol levels. In comparing virtual reality meditation and audio meditation, the effect size for anxiety was moderate (Cohen d=0.58) while the effect size for cortisol was small (Cohen d=0.08). Conclusion(s): Preliminary results suggest that virtual reality meditation has a moderate benefit for anxiety but not physiologic stress. Future research is needed to confirm these results in a larger sample and to investigate whether the effects are sustained or increase with repeated use of virtual reality mediation. Virtual reality meditation appears feasible to deliver among homeless youth and merits further study.Copyright © Laura Johnson Chavez, Kelly Kelleher, Natasha Slesnick, Eugene Holowacz, Ellison Luthy, Laura Moore, Jodi Ford.

N2  - The effects of housing instability and homelessness on child and adult health are well documented. However, few studies have explored health and housing interventions for families with children with the objective of health improvement. Housing Prescriptions as Health Care is a randomized controlled trial that is investigating the impact on physical and mental health of integrating priority placement in affordable housing and the provision of services (case management, financial, and legal), compared to the standard of care (providing resource guides and hospital-based social work or care navigation services). In 2016-19 seventy-eight homeless or housing-unstable families defined as "medically complex"-with a child or adult member who used more health services than usual or had a chronic disease or disability- were enrolled in the trial, and sixty-seven completed a six-month follow-up. A difference-in-differences analysis at six months showed decreases in the share of children in fair or poor health and in average anxiety and depression scores among parents in the intervention group, relative to the control group. Findings suggest that a population-specific model that integrates health, housing, legal, and social services can improve health-related outcomes at the household level.Copyright © 2020 Project HOPE- The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.

N2  - Reach (i.e., proportion and representativeness of participants) of low-intensity, multicomponent childhood overweight/obesity interventions delivered in primary care settings with low-income and/or minority families is unknown. The purpose of this research is to describe the reach of a lowintensity, multicomponent childhood overweight/obesity intervention delivered in an integrated primary care setting in a federally qualified health center (FQHC). Eligibility criteria included children aged 4-10 years with a body mass index (BMI) >=85th percentile, with a female caregiver. Using the electronic health record (EHR) and release forms, families were broadly categorized into groupings from recruitment flow, with differing proportions calculated from these groupings. Representativeness was determined using EHR data from families who were informed about the program (n = 963). Three calculated reach rates ranged from 54.9% to 3.9%. Lower reach rates were calculated using the number of families randomized (n = 73) as the numerator and the children from families who were informed about the program (n = 963) or all eligible children in the FQHC attending appointments (n = 1,864) as denominators. The first two steps in recruitment, informing families about the program and families initiating participation, were where the largest decreases in reach occurred. Children who were randomized were older, had a higher BMI, had a greater number of medical diagnoses indicating overweight or obesity, and were Hispanic. Reach of the intervention was low. Strategies that assist with reducing time for informing families of treatment and increasing families' awareness of their child's weight status should assist with enhancing reach.Copyright © 2019 Society of Behavioral Medicine.

N2  - Objective: To examine diet quality and dietary intake among residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods in the Southeast United States (U.S.) and to examine associations between dietary and socioeconomic factors. Design(s): We examined baseline data from an evaluation study of a healthy food access initiative. Participants were recruited from two urban settings comprising seven neighborhoods of high household poverty (17% to 62%). Participants completed in-person interviews with measures of education, household income, and food security and one unannounced 24-hour dietary recall by telephone with trained registered dietitians. Food desert residence was coded based on U.S. Census data. Proportions meeting 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI-2010) scores were computed. Associations between dietary variables and participant's education, household income, food security, and food desert residence were tested. Result(s): Participants (n=465) were predominantly African American (92%), women (80%), and overweight or obese (79%), and 52+/-14 years of age. Sixty-three percent had low or very low food security, and 82% lived in census tracts of low income and low access to supermarkets (urban food desert). HEI-2010 scores averaged 48.8+/-13.1. A minority of participants met dietary guidelines. Diet quality was lower among participants with lower education and among those from food insecure households (p<.05). Household income and food security were positively associated with meeting several dietary guidelines (p<.05). Food desert residence was unrelated to diet variables. Conclusion(s): In this disadvantaged population, significant nutritional concerns were observed, and socioeconomic factors were associated with diet quality and meeting dietary guidelines. Interventions must address broader economic, social, and policy issues such as access to affordable healthy foods.

N2  - This study inquires whether a new structurally dispossessed class is developing in the United States. The new class proposition is derived from social theory and operationalized by two empirical characteristics: not in the labor force (NILF) and family income below poverty. The primary data source is the Current Population Survey over the years from 1968 to 2018, and threshold demographic criteria for class development is specified as increasing size and diversity. Because evidence is found to support the latter criterion but not the former, the proposition that a new class is developing is partially rejected. The analysis finds that new social components are joining the NILF/impoverished including men, Hispanics, college graduates, and young adults. Second, that the NILF/impoverished are politically active in terms of electoral participation, and no more likely than the total electorate to have voted for a populist Presidential candidate in 2016. NILF/impoverished recipiency of state transfers varies over time, increasing through the Great Recession, then receding. The implications of the investigation are discussed in terms of the likelihood that the NILF/impoverished will generate new forms of political opposition to the rule of capital.Copyright © 2020 London School of Economics and Political Science.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Illicit drug use in adolescence has been linked to drug use and poor mental health in adult life, but few studies have examined the relation between adult economic and criminal justice outcomes. METHOD(S): We analysed data from 14 082 participants (6999 women) in the 1970 British Birth Cohort Study. Illicit drug use over study members' lifetime and in the past year were self-reported at 16 years of age. Thirteen outcomes were self-reported at 30 years of age, including illicit drug use, smoking, problems with alcohol, mental and physical health, experience of socioeconomic disadvantage and experiences with the criminal justice system. RESULT(S): At 16 years of age, 20.3% of the participants had ever tried an illicit drug and 7.2% had used in the past year. After adjustment for childhood socioeconomic status and mental health problems, and following correction for multiple testing, there was a dose-response association between illicit drug use at 16 years with illicit drug use in adult life in the past year (OR; 95% CI - 1.83, 1.51 to 3.12), experiencing homelessness (1.74, 1.16 to 2.62), being arrested (1.57, 1.29 to 1.92) and cautioned (1.97, 1.50 to 2.57) by the police, and being found guilty at court (1.73, 1.34 to 2.23). CONCLUSION(S): Adolescent drug use was associated with an array of social and criminal outcomes in later life.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Young people experiencing homelessness have alarmingly high rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use, which is associated with sexual risk behaviors such as unprotected sex, trading sex, and sex with multiple casual partners. Few risk reduction programs for this population have been developed and rigorously evaluated, particularly those that address both of these interrelated behaviors, use a collaborative and non-judgmental approach, and are feasible to deliver in settings where homeless young people seek services. This paper describes the protocol of a study evaluating a four-session Motivational Interviewing (MI)-based group risk reduction intervention for this population. The protocol has been shown to be efficacious in pilot work over 3 months with 200 homeless young adults [1]. The current study seeks to refine the intervention protocol and evaluate the program on a larger scale. METHODS/DESIGN: In a cluster-cross-over randomized controlled trial, 18-25 year olds will receive the AWARE risk reduction program (n=200) or standard care (n=200) at one of three drop-in centers serving homeless youth in the Los Angeles area. We will evaluate intervention effects on primary outcomes of AOD use and sexual risk behavior, as well as secondary outcomes of health-related quality of life and social stability, over a 12-month period. DISCUSSION: This project has the potential to fill a significant gap in prevention services by demonstrating that a brief intervention, feasible to deliver within settings where young people experiencing homelessness typically seeks services, can significantly reduce the interrelated problems of AOD use and sexual risk behavior.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Housing insecurity and homelessness contribute to risk of maltreatment among one in five of the nearly 3.5 million children annually investigated for maltreatment in the United States. The Family Unification Program (FUP)-a federal initiative-connects inadequately housed families involved in child welfare with long-term rental subsidies to avoid foster placement. However, FUP remains understudied and underutilized with funding levels that serve only a fraction of eligible households. The present study uses system dynamics modeling to inform decision-making by testing policies for scaling FUP. METHOD(S): Simulations model delivery of FUP within child welfare from a feedback perspective. Calibrated on national data, models replicate trends in child welfare involvement from 2013 through 2016, and analyses forecast rates through 2019. Experiments test policies that enhance FUP. Outcomes track system-wide rates of family separation and returns on investment of expanded housing interventions. RESULT(S): Dramatic expansions of FUP benefit more families and improve marginal return on investment. Yet, scale-up fails to reduce system-wide rates of family separation or generates substantial cost-savings. CONCLUSION(S): Simulations demonstrate structural challenges for scaling FUP. Constant demand for affordable housing constrains sustainable improvements in child protection. Child welfare responses to homelessness require innovations that reduce demand for housing services through prevention and earlier intervention.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Aim of this cluster randomized trial was to examine the impact of a school feeding programme combining healthy meals provision and educational activities to reduce food insecurity. METHOD(S): Schools participating in the DIATROFI Program in Greece during the 2014-2015 school year were randomly allocated between a multicomponent intervention (MI: each student received a daily healthy meal along with educational actions; 28 schools) and an educational intervention (EI; 23 schools). A linear-mixed model was used to examine intervention effect on change from baseline in the food insecurity score, as measured via the Food Security Survey Module (FSSM). The analysis was based on 1442 pre-post intervention questionnaire pairs in the MI group and 986 in the EI group. RESULT(S): The reduction in food insecurity score in the MI group was statistically significantly greater compared to the EI group, by 9.8% or -0.31 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.61 to -0.01] FSSM units after adjusting for potential confounders. MI intervention was significantly more effective compared to EI, among students in food insecure households (mean -0.44, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.04), students in households facing hunger (mean -1.04, 95% CI -1.91 to -0.17) and overweight/obese students (mean -0.36, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.01). CONCLUSION(S): For interventions aiming to address childhood food insecurity, public health focus should be oriented towards school-based programmes combining food assistance with activities that promote healthy nutrition.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.

N2  - PURPOSE: Compare selected sociodemographic and sexual risk characteristics of black/African American (black) men who have sex with men only (MSMO) and men who have sex with men and women (MSMW) in the southeastern United States (the South). METHOD(S): We conducted bivariate and multivariable analyses to explore the sociodemographic characteristics and sexual risk behaviors of 584 MSMW and MSMO in the South. RESULT(S): MSMW had lesser odds of having a college or graduate degree (aOR=0.32; 95% CI=0.19, 0.54) and having >2 male oral sex partners (aOR=0.20; 95% CI=0.08, 0.48) compared to MSMO. MSMW had greater odds of being homeless (aOR=3.11; 95% CI=1.80, 5.38) and selecting "top" sexual position (aOR=1.70; 95% CI=1.07, 2.72) compared to MSMO. CONCLUSION(S): MSMW in the South experience social and structural factors that may affect their risk for HIV infection. Strategies to address these factors should be considered in prevention and care efforts for this population.

N2  - Introduction:Alaska Native communities experience high rates of alcohol and substance abuse and face challenges accessing quality, culturally appropriate treatment. Telepsychiatry could help bridge this gap, but no publications have examined its impacts for alcohol and substance abuse treatment directed at Alaska Native communities. This study explores one telepsychiatry clinic's impact on a residential substance abuse treatment serving the Alaska Native community in Anchorage, Alaska. Method(s):Using a matched case-control design, 103 cases receiving telepsychiatry services between 2007 and 2012 were matched with 103 controls who did not. Outcome measures included length of stay, discharge plans, emergency room visits, and hospital admissions; clinical history, including previous suicide attempts, history of violence, and trauma history; social stressors such as current legal issues, unemployment, and homelessness; mental health, medical, and substance abuse diagnoses; and number of telepsychiatry appointments and nature of telepsychiatry services rendered. Result(s):Both groups exhibited high rates of mental and medical illness, socioeconomic challenges, and substance abuse. However, the telepsychiatry group demonstrated a significantly higher rate of post-traumatic stress disorder, history of violence, ongoing legal issues, and children in outside custody. It also remained engaged in treatment longer, had fewer discharges against medical advice, and was more likely to complete treatment.Discussion/Conclusions:Our study highlights this telepsychiatry clinic's real-world difference serving the complex substance abuse treatment needs of Alaska Native individuals. It also reinforces telepsychiatry's promise in serving other communities facing a high burden of addiction and mental illness yet facing barriers to high-quality, culturally competent services.

N2  - Posttraumatic stress symptoms are a pressing issue among women experiencing incarceration and homelessness. Baseline data were collected among formerly incarcerated homeless women (N=130) who were on average 38.9 (SD = 11.36, range 19-64) years of age and recruited into a pilot randomized control trial (RCT) intervention program. A logistic regression was used to assess correlates of PTSD symptoms. The majority of the sample self-reported witnessing violence (85%) and had moderate PTSD symptoms (M=1.61, SD = 1.62, range: 0-4). No past month drug use (p=0.006), higher anger scores (p=0.002), greater emotional support (p=0.009), and psychological frailty (p=0.02) were significantly associated with higher odds of PTSD symptoms. Moreover, women who experienced minor family conflicts had lower odds of PTSD symptoms relative to those that had family conflicts most of the time (p=0.02). Similarly, controlling for all other variables, women who had a higher positive social interaction score also had lower odds of PTSD symptoms (p=0.006). These findings are a call to action for academicians, service providers, and health practitioners to develop an intervention which integrates comprehensive PTSD screening, and discussion of ways to build coping skills, relationships with family and social networks, and utilizes a trauma-informed approach during reentry.

N2  - Despite many similarities, there are key differences in the ability of providers in the United States to assist homeless youth compared to their colleagues in the United Kingdom. However, legislation, and strategies to identify and advocate for youth experiencing homelessness can lead to improved health outcomes and other psychosocial improvements for youth. This article highlights, compares and contrasts the systems with a goal of greater understanding and opportunities to assist youth experiencing homelessness in either country.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Evidence from randomized controlled trials establishes that medication treatment with methadone and buprenorphine reduces opioid use and improves treatment retention. However, little is known about the role of such medications compared with non-medication treatments in mitigating overdose risk among US patient populations receiving treatment in usual care settings. This study compared overdose mortality among those in medication versus non-medication treatments in specialty care settings. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using state-wide treatment data linked to death records. Survival analysis was used to analyze data in a time-to-event framework. SETTING: Services delivered by 757 providers in publicly funded out-patient specialty treatment programs in Maryland, USA between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2016. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 48274 adults admitted to out-patient specialty treatment programs in 2015-16 for primary diagnosis of opioid use disorder. MEASUREMENTS: Main exposure was time in medication treatment (methadone/buprenorphine), time following medication treatment, time exposed to non-medication treatments and time following non-medication treatment. Main outcome was opioid overdose death during and after treatment. Hazard ratios were calculated using Cox proportional hazard regression. Propensity score weights were adjusted for patient information on sex, age, race, region of residence, marital and veteran status, employment, homelessness, primary opioid, mental health treatment, arrests and criminal justice referral. FINDINGS: The study population experienced 371 opioid overdose deaths. Periods in medication treatment were associated with substantially reduced hazard of opioid overdose death compared with periods in non-medication treatment [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.08-0.40]. Periods after discharge from non-medication treatment (aHR = 5.45, 95% CI = 2.80-9.53) and medication treatment (aHR = 5.85, 95% CI = 3.10-11.02) had similar and substantially elevated risks compared with periods in non-medication treatments. CONCLUSION(S): Among Maryland patients in specialty opioid treatment, periods in treatment are protective against overdose compared with periods out of care. Methadone and buprenorphine are associated with significantly lower overdose death compared with non-medication treatments during care but not after treatment is discontinued.Copyright © 2020 Society for the Study of Addiction.

N2  - The mental health and related quality of life of runaway adolescents are global public health issues. As few intervention studies have considered the family contexts of runaway adolescents, we aimed to develop an intervention tailored specifically to the needs of this population using an Intervention Mapping protocol. First, a literature review and interviews with runaway adolescents and youth shelter workers were conducted to create a logic model of the problem. Second, the behavioral and environmental outcomes were set to adapt to stressful situations and enable families to become more resourceful in dealing with family adversity, based on the results of needs assessment. Performance objectives and changeable determinants were also created by reviewing the pertinent theories and studies. Third, theory- and evidence-based methods to influence changes in the determinants were identified. Fourth, we designed an eight-session family-based mental health program incorporating individual and family approaches for runaway adolescents. Fifth, we determined that mental health nurses at community mental health centers linked to youth shelters would serve as the program implementers. Finally, we planned a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of our program on improving runaway adolescents' mental health status and perceived family functioning.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

N2  - The objective of this systematic review was to identify the available qualitative data and to develop a framework to address the life experiences of homeless families in parenthood. The research was performed in the PubMed and CINAHL Complete databases, for works published in Portuguese, English, French and Spanish. Studies that included qualitative data, or both qualitative and quantitative data, were considered for this research. A total of 358 articles were obtained, of which 37 were assessed for eligibility, and 26 were rejected. In the end, 11 studies were selected. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research was used. These studies were conducted mostly in the United States, in temporary/transitional shelters for nuclear or single-parent families (led by women) in a homeless situation. In this context, the area which arose as the more relevant one was mental health, followed by the social studies. Two types of dimensions emerged from the results: mediating dimensions (which include the categories "Insecurity", "Lack of Privacy", "Isolation", "Stigma" and "Disempowerment") that are responsible for difficulties related to education, and behavioural changes in both the parents and the children; and supporting dimensions (which include the categories "Context as a Facilitator", "Relationship with Others" and "Parents' and children's Self") that lead to motivation, as well as the acquisition of strategies by the parents, to resolve parenting issues. This research helps expand nursing knowledge and presents a synthesis of the life experiences of homeless families in parenthood. Nursing can respond to the vulnerable population, due to its predominant role in promoting their health.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Food resource management (FRM) behaviors are key components within nutrition education programs designed to help food insecure households maximize their food dollars. However, little is known about the association between FRM self-confidence and financial practices with household food insecurity (HFI) among families with young children. Using a sample of SNAP-Ed-eligible Head Start families, this study examined associations between FRM self-confidence, FRM behaviors and financial practices by HFI. A needs assessment survey was conducted with caregivers of Head Start children (n = 365). HFI was measured using the US Household Food Security Survey Module. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine if FRM self-confidence, FRM behaviors, and financial practices differed by HFI. Participants with high FRM self-confidence had lower odds of HFI (OR = 0.54, 95%CI: 0.33, 0.87), yet FRM behaviors, financial practices, and HFI were not related after adjusting for covariates. All FRM self-confidence questions significantly differed by HFI, whereas only one of six FRM behaviors and two of three financial practices differed by HFI (all p-values < 0.05). Promoting caregivers' self-confidence in FRM skills within nutrition education programs may be explored as a potential strategy to assist low-income households to stretch their food dollars in an attempt to address HFI.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

N2  - The majority of 36 million Bangladeshi adolescents live in rural areas. Improved understanding of their dietary patterns is of great public health importance. This study aimed to explore dietary diversity (DD) with its socioeconomic and gender stratification in a rural adolescent cohort and to isolate factors associated with inadequate DD. Household survey provided data for constructing dietary diversity scores (DDS) and assessing relevant socio-demographic variables. Final analysis included 2463 adolescents. Means and proportions were compared, and a binary logistic regression model was fitted. Inadequate DD was observed among 42.3% (40.3-44.2). Consumption of nutrient-rich foods varied significantly across gender and SES categories. Belonging to the poorest households (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.59; 95% CI: 1.27, 2.00) and food insecure households (aOR 1.34; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.59), adolescents' attainment of secondary education (aOR 1.38; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.71), and having mothers with secondary education or above (aOR 0.76; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.96) were associated with inadequate DD. Compared with girls from food secure households, girls from food insecure ones had higher odds of inadequate DD (aORgirl 1.42; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.81). Improving rural adolescents' DD would require targeted interventions as well as broader poverty alleviation.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Objectives: Since 2010, the number of homeless people in the UK has increased, and homelessness in its different types has become a major public health problem. Housed older people with past experience of homelessness are an understudied population that can provide valuable insight into this problem. For this reason, we examined the lifetime prevalence of homelessness and its associations with childhood adversity and mortality in a national sample of older people. Study design: This is a longitudinal cohort study. Method(s): We studied 6649 housed individuals aged 55-79 years in 2007 from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). We used logistic regression to model the association between adverse childhood experiences (ACE) and lifetime experience of homelessness (ever been homeless for >=1 months) and Cox proportional hazards regression to model the prospective association between lifetime experience of homelessness and mortality. Result(s): We identified 107 participants with lifetime experience of homelessness. We found a strong graded association between the number of ACE and lifetime experience of homelessness; participants with two ACE had 5.35 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.17-9.05) times greater odds of having experienced homelessness than those reporting none. Most ACE were individually associated with lifetime homelessness, but fewer remained so in the mutually adjusted model. Participants with lifetime experience of homelessness had 1.55 (95% CI: 1.01-2.37) times greater risk of mortality over a 10-year follow-up and after adjustment for covariates. Conclusion(s): Exposure to childhood adversity is associated with increased risk of experiencing homelessness. Older housed people with past experience of homelessness are at increased risk of mortality.Copyright © 2020 The Authors

N2  - This qualitative descriptive study explored what young people who are transitionally housed need to promote occupational participation. Nine young people and four staff members from a transitional living facility participated in interviews and focus groups. Results suggested that the young people need opportunities to practice independent living skills, develop routines to support employment, housing, and education, and receive more individualized support from service providers. Findings also reveal that service providers experience a range of barriers to meeting young people's needs. This study underscores the importance of occupational therapy practitioners being informed of national and regional policies as well as emerging evidence of innovative approaches with populations, communities, and individuals so as to ultimately develop novel, collaborative, occupation-based programs to help young people set goals and transition out of homelessness.Copyright © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

T1  - Gains in life expectancy in the Australian population due to reductions in smoking: comparisons between interventions targeting the population versus interventions in a specific high risk group

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Four decades of population-based tobacco control strategies have contributed to substantial reduction in smoking prevalence in Australia. However, smoking prevalence is still double in socially disadvantaged groups compared to those that are not. But not all tobacco control strategies successfully used in the general population is effective in specific high-risk population groups. Hence, an effective way to reduce smoking in high risk population groups may include targeting them specifically to identify and support smokers to quit. In this backdrop, we examined whether tobacco control interventions at the population-level are more effective in increasing life expectancy among Australians compared to interventions targeting a high risk group or a combination of the two when smoking prevalence is reduced to 10 and 0% respectively. METHOD(S): Using the risk percentiles approach, analyses were performed separately for men and women using data from various sources such as the 2014-15 National Health Survey linked to death registry, simulated data for high risk groups, and the Australian population and deaths data from the census. Indigenous status was simulated by preferentially assigning those who are indigenous to lower SES quintiles. The age-sex distribution of mental disorder status was simulated using its distribution from 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey with 25.9% of mentally ill being assigned to current smoking category and the rest to non-smoking category. The age-sex distribution of prisoners was simulated based on 2014 ABS Prisoners Australia survey with 74% of prisoners being assigned to current smoker category and the rest to non-smoker category. Homelessness status was simulated according to age, sex and indigenous status for 2011 census with all homeless being allocated to the lowest SES category. The age-sex distribution of total cholesterol level was simulated based on 2011-13 Australian Health Survey. RESULT(S): The results showed that the combined approach for reducing smoking is most effective for improving life expectancy of Australians particularly for the socially disadvantaged and mentally ill groups both of which have high fraction of smokers in the population. For those who were mentally ill the gain in ALE due to reduction of smoking to 10% was 0.53years for males and 0.36years for females which were around 51 and 42% respectively of the maximal gains in ALE that could be achieved through complete cessation. CONCLUSION(S): Targeting high-risk population groups having substantial fraction of smokers in the population can strongly complement the existing population-based smoking reduction strategies. As population and high risk approaches are both important, the national prevention policies should make judicious use of both to maximize health gain.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Car accidents due to unexpected forward or backward runaway by older drivers are a serious social problem. Although the cause of these accidents is often attributed to stepping on the accelerator instead of the brake, it is difficult to induce such pedal application errors systematically with usual drive simulators. We developed a simple personal computer system that induces the pedal errors, and investigate the effects of age on the error behaviors. METHOD(S): The system consisted of a laptop computer and a three-pedal foot mouse. It measured response time, accuracy, and flexibility of pedal operation to visual stimuli. The system displayed two open circles on the computer display, lighting one of the circles in a random order and interval. Subjects were instructed to press the foot pedal with their right foot as quickly as possible when the circle was lit; the ipsilateral pedal to the lit circle in a parallel mode and the contralateral pedal in a cross mode. When the correct pedal was pressed, the light went off immediately, but when the wrong pedal was pressed, the buzzer sounded and the light remained on until the correct pedal was pressed. During a 6-min trial, the mode was switched between parallel and cross every 2 min. During the cross mode, a cross mark appears on the display. The pedal responses were evaluated in 52 subjects divided into young (20-29 years), middle-aged (30-64 years), and older (65-84 years) groups. Additionally, the repeatability of the pedal response characteristic indicators was examined in 14 subjects who performed this test twice. RESULT(S): The mean response time was 95ms (17%) longer in the older group than in the young group. More characteristically, however, the older group showed 2.1 times more frequent pedal errors, fell into long hesitations (response freezing > 3s) 16 times more often, and took 1.8 times longer period to correct the wrong pedal than the young groups. The indicators of pedal response characteristics showed within-individual repeatability to the extent that can identify the age-dependent changes. CONCLUSION(S): Hesitations and extended error correction time can be associated with increased crash risk due to unexpected runaway by older drivers. The system we have developed may help to uncover and evaluate physiological characteristics related to crash risk in the elderly population.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Introduction: it has been close to four years since the authors highlighted the total neglect of the oral health of street children in the Journal of Public Health Policy. Since then, the authorities appear to have simply turned the blind eye making this follow-up imperative. This follow-up report specifically examines the resultant oral health disparity between Nigeria's street children and Private, fee-paying secondary school students in Northern Nigeria. Method(s): we conducted a cross-sectional comparative survey of randomly selected 12-14 years old street children (children of Quranic informal educational institutions) in Northern Nigeria while fee paying, private secondary school children served as controls. A simple close-ended questionnaire translated into Hausa language was used to assess oral health knowledge and the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index used to categorize oral hygiene status of the participants. Result(s): the mean age (SD) of the participating street children was 12.7 (0.86) while that of the private secondary school students (PSSS) was 13.05 (0.96). The majority (89%) of parents of street children compared with that (7%) of parents of students of private secondary schools had no western education. Only 6% of street children compared with 90% of PSSS cleaned their teeth for the right reasons. Only 5% of street children compared with 90% of private secondary school students used a fluoride-containing toothpaste. Though both groups of children have poor knowledge (street children 3%, private secondary school students 16%) on the use of dental floss, the mean oral hygiene score (SD) for street children was 4.42 (0.85) compared with 1.90 (0.09) for private secondary school students. There were striking differences in knowledge and practice with only 4% of street children compared with 69% of PSSS with knowledge about fluoride and its use (p < 0.0005). Also, 2% of street children compared with 40% of PSSS were aware of the benefits of regular dental visits. Sixty five (65%) of street children used finger and water only for tooth cleaning, none of the secondary school students practiced this (p = 0.0005). Conclusion(s): there is disparity in oral health practice between Nigeria's street children and private secondary school children. This disparity may be attributed to lack of western education and socio-economic status.Copyright © Enoch Abiodun Idowu et al.

N2  - Objective: Limited research has evaluated the efficacy of suicide prevention interventions among homeless youth, especially considering how their connectedness with their family would impact treatment outcomes. Method(s): Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) between the ages of 18-24 years were recruited from a local drop-in center. Youth were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or Treatment as Usual alone. Youth reported their family network satisfaction at the baseline assessment, whereas their suicidal ideation, perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness were assessed at baseline and three additional times during a nine-month period. Result(s): A multiple-group autoregressive cross-lagged model suggests that CTSP was associated with lower suicidal ideation and lower thwarted belongingness only among those with high family network satisfaction. Among both groups, perceived burdensomeness predicted higher suicidal ideation, which in turn predicted lower perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. Additionally, only among youth with low family network satisfaction, thwarted belongingness predicted lower suicidal ideation. Conclusion(s): Findings suggest that family network satisfaction may be an important factor when considering cognitive interventions with homeless youth, with implications to improve treatment efforts and to reduce premature mortality, hospitalization and loss of human capital in a very high-risk population.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Objective: To assess relationships between material hardships, shortened sleep duration, and suboptimal sleep practices across infancy and toddlerhood in low-income Hispanic families. Method(s): We analyzed longitudinal data of 451 low-income Hispanic mother-child pairs from a child obesity prevention trial. During infancy and toddlerhood, we used adjusted linear regression to assess associations between material hardship (financial difficulty, food insecurity, housing disrepair, and multiple hardships), sleep duration (24-hour, night), and the number of suboptimal sleep practices (eg, later bedtime, co-sleeping). We used adjusted linear regression to assess the longitudinal association between the number of suboptimal sleep practices in infancy and toddlerhood, and tested whether specific or multiple hardships moderated this association. Result(s): In infants, financial difficulty and multiple hardships were associated with decreased night sleep (B = -0.59 hours, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.04, -0.14; and B = -0.54 hours, 95% CI: -1.00, -0.08). Housing disrepair was associated with decreased 24-hour sleep (B = -0.64 hours, 95% CI: -1.29, -0.01). In toddlers, each additional suboptimal sleep practice was associated with a decrease in night sleep (B = -0.19 hours, 95% CI: -0.29, -0.09). Each additional suboptimal sleep practice in infancy was associated with a 0.30 increase in the number of suboptimal sleep practices in toddlerhood (P < .001), with greater increases for those with food insecurity or multiple hardships. Conclusion(s): Specific and multiple hardships shortened sleep duration during infancy, and moderated the increase of suboptimal sleep behaviors between infancy and toddlerhood. Future studies should consider these early critically sensitive periods for interventions to mitigate material hardships and establish healthy sleep practices.Copyright © 2020 Academic Pediatric Association

N2  - Objective: We examined associations between household food insecurity status and parental feeding behavior, weight perception, and child weight status in a diverse sample of young children. Method(s): Cross-sectional analysis of 2-year-old children in Greenlight, a cluster randomized trial to prevent childhood obesity. The exposure was food insecurity, defined as a positive response to a validated screen. Outcomes were parent feeding behaviors/beliefs measured by the Child Feeding Questionnaire and child weight status. t tests and linear regression were used to assess associations between food insecurity and each outcome. We adjusted for child sex, race/ethnicity, parent education, employment, site, number of children in the home, and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children status. Result(s): Five hundred three households (37%) were food insecure. After adjusting for covariates, parents from insecure households reported more pressuring feeding behaviors (mean factor score 3.2 compared to food secure parents mean factor score 2.9, P = .01) and were more worried about their child becoming overweight (mean factor score 2.3 vs 2.0; P = .02). No differences were observed in monitoring or restrictive feeding behaviors. After adjusting for covariates, there was no difference in weight status or prevalence of overweight/obesity of children or parents based on household food insecurity status. Conclusion(s): Parents from food insecure households reported more pressuring feeding behaviors. This finding underscores the need to address food insecurity and potentially prevent harmful effects on child feeding. Parents in food insecure households might benefit from linkage with resources and education to develop healthier feeding behaviors.Copyright © 2020 Academic Pediatric Association

N2  - Background: Childhood homelessness is a growing concern in Ireland [1] creating a paediatric subpopulation at increased risk of physical illnesses, many with life-long consequences [2]. Aim(s): Our aim was to identify and categorize the physical morbidities prevalent in homeless children. Method(s): A review of the English-language literature on physical morbidities affecting homeless children (defined as <= 18 years of age) published from 1999 to 2019 was conducted. Result(s): Respiratory issues were the most commonly cited illnesses affecting homeless children, including asthma, upper respiratory tract infections, and chronic cough [3]. Homeless children were described as being at increased risk for contracting infectious diseases, with many studies placing emphasis on the risks of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS transmission [4, 5]. Dermatologic concerns for this population comprised of scabies and head lice infestation, dermatitis, and abrasions [3, 6]. Malnutrition manifested as a range of physical morbidities, including childhood obesity [7], iron deficiency anemia [4], and stunted growth [8]. Studies demonstrated a higher prevalence of poor dental [7] and ocular health [9] in this population as well. Many articles also commented on the risk factors predisposing homeless children to these physical health concerns, which can broadly be categorized as limited access to health care, poor living conditions, and lack of education [3, 10]. Conclusion(s): This literature review summarized the physical illnesses prevalent among homeless children and the contributing factors leading to them. Gaps in the literature were also identified and included a dearth of studies focusing on younger children compared with adolescents. Further research into prevention and intervention programs for this vulnerable population is urgently needed.Copyright © 2020, Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.

N2  - Homeless young adults are more likely than their never-homeless counterparts to abuse substances and engage in sexual risk behaviors. This study evaluated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of OnTrack, a smartphone application to self-monitor substance use and sexual risk behaviors, plus a brief motivational intervention (BMI), in reducing substance use and sexual risk among homeless young adults. A randomized controlled pilot trial (N = 60) compared OnTrack + BMI to treatment as usual (TAU) at an inner-city crisis shelter for homeless young adults (aged 18-21 years). Participants were assessed at baseline and 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks after baseline to evaluate substance use and sexual risk behaviors. Kruskal-Wallis tests determined differences between baseline and postintervention assessments. Logistic regression models examined treatment effect on change in outcomes between baseline and postintervention follow-up assessment, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in OnTrack + BMI significantly reduced past 2-week number of drinks (p =.023), times used marijuana (p =.046), times engaged in unprotected sex (p =.012), and times used drugs before sexual activity (p =.019). No reductions of substance use or sexual risk behaviors were found among participants in TAU (all ps >.05). After adjusting for baseline levels of substance use and sexual risk, participants in OnTrack + BMI had significantly lower odds than those in TAU for drinking alcohol (adjusted OR = 0.14; p =.01) and having unprotected sex (adjusted OR = 0.151; p =.032). OnTrack + BMI is feasible and effective in reducing past 2-week alcohol use and unprotected sex among homeless young adults. A larger randomized trial is warranted to replicate and extend present results.Copyright © 2020 American Psychological Association.

N2  - Purpose: This study provides information on how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is affecting emerging adults currently or recently homeless in terms of engagement in protective behaviors, mental health, substance use, and access to services. Method(s): Ninety participants in an ongoing clinical trial of a risk reduction program for homeless, aged 18-25 years, were administered items about COVID-19 between April 10 and July 9, 2020. Result(s): Most participants reported engaging in COVID-19 protective behaviors. Past week mental health symptoms were reported by 38%-48% of participants, depending on symptoms. Among those who used substances before the outbreak, 16%-28% reported increased use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. More than half of the participants reported increased difficulty meeting basic needs (e.g., food), and approximately 32%-44% reported more difficulty getting behavioral health services since the outbreak. Conclusion(s): Innovative strategies are needed to address the increased behavioral health needs of young people experiencing homelessness during events such as the COVID-19 outbreak.Copyright © 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine

T1  - A comparison of frequency of alcohol and marijuana use using short message service surveying and survey questionnaires among homeless youth
A1  - Tyler K.A.
A1  - Olson K. 
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Background: There are several benefits to using short message service surveying (SMS) to gather data on substance use from homeless youth, including capturing data "in the moment" and verifying the timing of one behavior relative to another. Though SMS is a valuable data collection tool with highly mobile populations that otherwise are difficult to longitudinally sample, the reliability of SMS compared with surveys is largely unknown with homeless youth. Examining the reliability of SMS is important because these data can provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between various risk behaviors, which may lead to better intervention strategies with these youth. Objective(s): We compared past 30-day survey and SMS data for youth's alcohol and marijuana use. Method(s): Interviewed 150 homeless youth (51% female) using surveys and SMS. Result(s): Past 30-day survey and SMS data revealed moderately strong correlations for alcohol (rs = .563) and marijuana (rs = .564). Regression analysis revealed that independent variables were similarly associated with alcohol and marijuana use when comparing survey and SMS data with two exceptions: heterosexual youth reported less alcohol use in SMS data compared to survey data (beta = -.212; p < .05 vs. beta = -.006; p > .05, respectively) and youth whose parents had alcohol problems reported less marijuana use in survey data compared to SMS data (beta = -.277; p < .01 vs. beta = -.150; p > .05, respectively). Conclusion(s): Findings indicate SMS and surveys are both reliable methods of gathering data from homeless youth on substance use.Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Background: In youth at familial risk for bipolar disorder (BD), mood lability is an important precursor to BD onset. Previous work in adults indicates that mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) may improve emotion regulation, in part by increasing resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and executive control network (ECN). In this pilot study, we assessed effects of an MBI on PCC-ECN rsFC and mood lability in at-risk youth. Method(s): We recruited 35 youth (10-14 years old) with a first-degree family history of BD and mood lability, and 21 age-matched healthy controls. Eligible at-risk youth were scanned pre/post an 8-week MBI and assessed three months later. Healthy controls were scanned at matched timepoints but did not participate in the MBI. The MBI used age-appropriate strategies to promote non-judgmental, present-moment awareness. We assessed pre/post changes in PCC-ECN rsFC and how rsFC changes were related to mood outcomes. Result(s): Twenty at-risk youth were scanned pre/post MBI; 16 had high-quality rsFC data. Following MBI, at-risk youth showed increased rsFC between PCC and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (BA 9; k = 28; corrected p=.006); healthy controls did not show this increase. Following MBI, at-risk youth reported more mindfulness (F = 7.15, p=.003), less mood lability (F = 7.2, p=.002), and less suppression of negative emotions (F = 5.05, p=.01). PCC-DLPFC rsFC increases predicted less mood lability (t=-2.25, p=.04) and less emotion suppression (t=-2.75, p=.02) at follow-up. Limitation(s): Small sample and lack of a control intervention. Conclusion(s): PCC-DLPFC rsFC may be a clinically meaningful neural target of an MBI in at-risk youth, related to improvements in mood lability.Copyright © 2020

N2  - Background: Homelessness is associated with crime victimisation, which is a leading cause of death, exacerbates health problems, and increases the risk of violence. We aimed to study the risk of police-recorded crime victimisation in individuals with experiences of homelessness compared with the general population. Method(s): We did a nationwide, register-based cohort study of people aged 15 years or older, who were alive in 2001 and born in Denmark between 1980 and 2001. The cohort was constructed using the Danish Civil Registration System, with data linked across other registries (including the Danish Homeless Register, Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register, and the Danish Central Crime Register) by use of personal identification numbers. The exposure, experience of homelessness, was defined as at least one contact with a homeless shelter. The outcome was the date of first police-recorded crime victimisation. We calculated incidence rates per 1000 person-years, incidence rate ratios (IRRs), and cumulative probability of any crime victimisation and of violent crime victimisation. Psychiatric disorders, socioeconomic markers, and history of criminal offences were included as confounders. Finding(s): Within the study period (Jan 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2015), 1 182 749 individuals (9 831 776 person-years) aged 15-35 years were included, of which 184 813 (15.6%) had at least one crime victimisation incident (73 999 [40%] of which were violent victimisations). 4286 individuals (22 240 person-years) had at least one homeless shelter contact. Relative to the general population, and adjusting for age and calendar year, individuals with experience of homelessness had an increased risk of any crime victimisation (IRR 2.7 [95% CI 2.4-3.0]) in females and 2.3 [2.1-2.5] in males), and especially of violent crime victimisation (7.2 [6.3-8.2] in females and 3.6 [3.2-4.0] in males). This increased risk remained significant after further adjustments for potential confounders. People with both a psychiatric diagnosis and experience of homelessness had the highest risk of violent victimisation (IRR 10.1 [95% CI 8.6-11.9] in females and 4.3 [3.8-4.9] in males), while people with no psychiatric diagnosis or experience of homelessness (the reference group) had the lowest risk. In the 5 years after an individual's first homeless shelter contact, the cumulative probabilities of any crime victimisation were 23% (95% CI 21-26) in females and 16% (15-18) in males, which were substantially higher than those of the general population. Interpretation(s): Homeless populations are at substantially increased risk of crime victimisation, highlighting the need for strategic and targeted approaches to prevent homelessness and to help people out of homelessness. Improvements in multiagency working (such as between homeless shelters, health-care services, substance misuse services, and police forces) might be important to reduce the risk of victimisation in marginalised populations, such as those with complex psychiatric or social problems, with experience of homelessness.

T1  - Household Food Insecurity Predicts Childhood Undernutrition: A Cross-Sectional Study in West Oromia (Ethiopia)

N2  - Background. Despite mixed reports, food insecurity emerges as a predictor of nutritional status, assumably limiting the quantity and quality of dietary intake. In Ethiopia, the prevalence of childhood undernutrition and food insecurity is highly pronounced. However, whether household food insecurity predicts undernutrition in children was not yet well established. Thus, the aim of the present study was to identify the link between household food access and undernutrition in children aged 6-23 months in West Oromia zones, Ethiopia. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 525 households during June-October 2016. Food access was measured as Household Food Insecurity Access Scale. Semistructured interviewer-administered questionnaires were employed to collect data on sociodemographics, child health, child dietary practices, household food security, and anthropometrics. The height and weight of children aged 6-23 months in each household were measured. Multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to assess the association between household food insecurity and child nutritional status measured from undernutrition indicators. Results. Overall, more than two-thirds (69%) of households were classified as food insecure (had insufficient access to adequate food), with a mean (SD) household food access score of 7.9 (7.7). The respective prevalence of mild and moderate food-insecure households was 56.6% and 12.4%. Higher proportions of children in food-insecure households were stunted (41.8% vs. 15.5%), underweight (22.0% vs. 6.1%), and wasted (14.9% vs. 6.1%). Overall, the prevalence of child undernutrition was 21.3% in the target population, with 16.2% stunted, 6.9% underweight, and 6.3% wasted. The present finding shows food-secure households were 54% protective (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.25-0.84) for child undernutrition. Compared to children in food-secure households, children who were reportedly living in moderately food-insecure households were over twice more likely stunted (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.02-4.28) and over 4 times more likely underweight (OR: 4.73, 95% CI: 1.81-12.35). However, household food insecurity was not a correlate for acute malnutrition (wasting) in children. Conclusions. The prevalence of household's food insecurity situation is very common and more pronounced among households with undernourished children aged 6-23 months in Ethiopia. The analysis of this work shows that moderately food-insecure households are a salient predictor for composite undernutrition, stunting, and underweight, but not for wasting. Thus, this finding informs the need for multisectoral strategies and policies to combat household's food insecurity and multiple forms of child undernutrition, beyond the socioeconomic wellbeing.Copyright © 2020 Wondu Garoma Berra.

N2  - Homeless youth have extremely high rates of suicidal ideation and attempts, but limited research has evaluated the efficacy of suicide prevention interventions. Suicidal homeless youth (N = 150) between the ages of 18 to 24 years were recruited from a local drop-in center. Of interest was (1) whether the proposed sample of eligible youth could be identified, (2) whether youth could be engaged and retained in the prevention intervention, and (3) whether the intervention was associated with reduced suicidal ideation, our primary outcome measure. In particular, youth were randomly assigned to Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) + Treatment as Usual (TAU) (N = 75) or TAU alone (N = 75). Findings showed that the proposed sample of eligible youth could be identified and engaged in the study, and all youth showed a significant decline in suicidal ideation over time, with a faster decline among youth assigned to CTSP. These findings suggest that (1) at-risk suicidal youth can be identified and engaged outside of hospital emergency rooms, such as in drop-in centers, and (2) intervention added to TAU can strengthen reductions in suicidal ideation. Ultimately, attention towards reducing suicide risk among these youth has the potential to reduce premature mortality, hospitalization and loss of human capital.Copyright © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Objectives: To compare the sociodemographic characteristics of participants in a contraceptive initiative by housing security and determine the association between housing insecurity on contraceptive method selection before and after the removal of cost. Study design: This cross-sectional assessment includes 4,327 reproductive-aged participants in the HER Salt Lake Contraceptive Initiative who sought new contraceptive services and reported housing status at enrollment. HER Salt Lake prospectively explored the impact of improved contraceptive access on socioeconomic outcomes in Salt Lake County (USA). For six months (September 2015-March 2016) we collected control data, which included clinic standard-of-care cost-sharing. The intervention started March 2016, and provided no-cost contraception services and unlimited opportunities for method switching over the subsequent three years. Result(s): There were 964 (22%) housing-insecure participants. Compared to those with stable housing, housing-insecure individuals more commonly identified as a sexual minority, received public assistance and lacked health insurance. Housing-insecure women preferentially selected long-acting reversible contraception during the control period (aOR 1.60; 95%CI 1.01-2.56), but method selection equalized across housing status during the intervention. Conclusion(s): When cost is not a barrier, all women desire a comprehensive selection of contraceptive methods, regardless of housing security. Contraceptive clients in this vulnerable population need interventions which address access barriers to all methods to support reproductive planning. Implications: Unintended pregnancy during housing insecurity may result in homelessness. This study found housing-insecure women desire access to all contraceptive methods, not just long acting reversible contraception. Integration of comprehensive family planning initiatives into efforts to address homelessness is essential to support this vulnerable population in their reproductive planning.Copyright © 2019

N2  - The global population of perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) children is growing, with relatively little known about their psychosocial outcomes, particularly across adolescence and young adulthood. Using data from a longitudinal cohort study of HEU youth in New York City (N = 134), we examine rates of substance use disorders (SUD) and non-SUD psychiatric disorders (mood, anxiety, and behavioral) at five time-points during adolescence and young adulthood, as well as associated demographic and environmental factors and the association of ever having a disorder with young adult developmental milestones. HEU participants in this study experienced high rates of psychiatric disorders, particularly SUD in young adulthood. During the entire study period (2003-2018), over one third were diagnosed at least once with a SUD, and 69% were diagnosed with a non-SUD psychiatric disorder. Older age and female gender were associated with higher rates of non-SUD diagnoses. A history of meeting criteria for any disorder at any time point was associated with reduced odds in young adulthood of working or being in school and increased odds of reporting incarceration, homelessness, and recent condomless sex. There is an urgent need to develop systems to follow HEU youth and provide services to intervene and treat psychiatric disorders, including substance use.Copyright © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - My Baby's First Teacher is an intervention designed specifically for parents with infants staying in emergency homeless shelters. Infants are overrepresented in shelter populations and face considerable risk to their development, including mental health. We utilized a randomized controlled design across three family shelters to evaluate the program's effectiveness with 24 dyads assigned to the intervention compared to 21 dyads in care-as-usual. Dyads were randomized by round at each site to account for shelter effects. We used path analysis to illustrate change over time and in relation to intervention assignment.Copyright © 2020 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health

N2  - Economic vulnerability, such as homelessness and unemployment, contributes to HIV risk among U.S. racial minorities. Yet, few economic-strengthening interventions have been adapted for HIV prevention in this population. This study assessed the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial of a 20-week microenterprise intervention for economically-vulnerable African-American young adults. Engaging MicroenterprisE for Resource Generation and Health Empowerment (EMERGE) aimed to reduce sexual risk behaviors and increase employment and uptake of HIV preventive behaviors. The experimental group received text messages on job openings plus educational sessions, mentoring, a start-up grant, and business and HIV prevention text messages. The comparison group received text messages on job openings only. Primary feasibility objectives assessed recruitment, randomization, participation, and retention. Secondary objectives examined employment, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV preventive behaviors. Outcome assessments used an in-person pre- and post-intervention interview and a weekly text message survey. Several progression criteria for a definitive trial were met. Thirty-eight participants were randomized to experimental (n=19) or comparison group (n=19) of which 95% were retained. The comparison intervention enhanced willingness to be randomized and reduced non-participation. Mean age of participants was 21.0 years; 35% were male; 81% were unemployed. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of experimental participants completed>=70% of intervention activities, and 74% completed>=50% of intervention activities. Participation in intervention activities and outcome assessments was highest in the first half (~10 weeks) of the study. Seventy-one percent (71%) of weekly text message surveys received a response through week 14, but responsiveness declined to 37% of participants responding to>=70% of weekly text message surveys at the end of the study. The experimental group reported higher employment (from 32% at baseline to 83% at week 26) and lower unprotected sex (79% to 58%) over time compared to reported changes in employment (37% to 47%) and unprotected sex (63% to 53%) over time in the comparison group. Conducting this feasibility trial was a critical step in the process of designing and testing a behavioral intervention. Development of a fully-powered effectiveness trial should take into account lessons learned regarding intervention duration, screening, and measurement.Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study explored factors associated with attrition of vulnerable women from a community-based, longitudinal mental health intervention study. DESIGN: The study employed a quasi-experimental, nonequivalent comparison group pretest-posttest design. The intervention consisted of six, 90-min meetings featuring education and support. SAMPLE: One hundred and eighteen women aged 18-88 years enrolled from four urban neighborhoods. MEASUREMENTS: The team used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Primary Health Questionnaire-9, a self-care knowledge for anxiety and depression instrument, and demographics to measure variables. INTERVENTION: Sessions occurred at trusted neighborhood sites. The team provided transportation, child care, and reminder calls or texts. Community health workers actively encouraged participants to continue in the study. The researchers did not offer financial incentives. Completion of the intervention involved attending four of six sessions. RESULT(S): The study had a 39% attrition rate. Results, using a Chi-square test for independence, indicated significant associations between attrition, neighborhood/homelessness, and family income. Additionally, there were significant associations between attrition, a past diagnosis of anxiety, and a lack of concurrent therapy for anxiety/depression. CONCLUSION(S): This study identified social determinants and mental health factors linked to the attrition of urban, ethnically diverse, and impoverished women from longitudinal intervention studies.Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Little is known regarding the specific types of service models and collaborations that are necessary to support diverse populations of youth in transition out of homelessness. Transitional supports addressing the complex needs of this population are needed to stabilize the array of housing arrangements that youth access. This study was a pilot randomized controlled trial of one such critical time intervention, called the Housing Outreach Program- Collaboration (HOP-C). HOP-C is a multicomponent, multidisciplinary intervention that provides 6 months of mental health and peer support, along with transitional case management to youth who have transitioned into some form of stable housing out of homelessness. In this trial, 65 youth were randomized to receive HOP-C plus treatment as usual or transitional case management plus treatment as usual. Outcome assessments were completed by 30 treatment and 28 control participants. The findings suggest that this intervention is feasible with mental health, employment or education, and housing metrics favoring HOP-C with odds ratios ranging from 2.28 to 3.18 and better subjective housing stability. Other indicators showed less change. HOP-C appears feasible and should be tested in a fully powered trial, providing the intervention for a duration longer than 6 months. Overall, these data suggest the potential benefit in fostering city-level, multidisciplinary teams sourced from several organizations to support youth transitioning out of homelessness. Pragmatic trial method considerations for this population are also addressed as are the ethical considerations pertinent to engaging highly marginalized youth in clinical trials.Copyright © 2020 Global Alliance for Behavioral Health and Social Justice.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Street-connected children and youth (SCY) in Kenya disproportionately experience preventable morbidities and premature mortality. We theorize these health inequities are socially produced and result from systemic discrimination and a lack of human rights attainment. Therefore, we sought to identify and understand how SCY's social and health inequities in Kenya are produced, maintained, and shaped by structural and social determinants of health using the WHO conceptual framework on social determinants of health (SDH) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) General Comment no. 17. METHOD(S): This qualitative study was conducted from May 2017 to September 2018 using multiple methods including focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, archival review of newspaper articles, and analysis of a government policy document. We purposively sampled 100 participants including community leaders, government officials, vendors, police officers, general community residents, parents of SCY, and stakeholders in 5 counties across Kenya to participate in focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. We conducted a thematic analysis situated in the conceptual framework on SDH and the CRC. RESULT(S): Our findings indicate that SCY's social and health disparities arise as a result of structural and social determinants stemming from a socioeconomic and political environment that produces systemic discrimination, breaches human rights, and influences their unequal socioeconomic position in society. These social determinants influence SCY's intermediary determinants of health resulting in a lack of basic material needs, being precariously housed or homeless, engaging in substance use and misuse, and experiencing several psychosocial stressors, all of which shape health outcomes and equity for this population. CONCLUSION(S): SCY in Kenya experience social and health inequities that are avoidable and unjust. These social and health disparities arise as a result of structural and social determinants of health inequities stemming from the socioeconomic and political context in Kenya that produces systemic discrimination and influences SCYs' unequal socioeconomic position in society. Remedial action to reverse human rights contraventions and to advance health equity through action on SDH for SCY in Kenya is urgently needed.

N2  - Most homeless young people have experienced multiple adversities, with potential implications for the development of Executive Functions (EFs), higher-order cognitive processes important for adaptation. EFs have been identified as putative contributors to the capacity to exit homelessness, however, little research has investigated EFs in homeless young people. To address gaps in current knowledge, this study compared executive function performance between homeless and housed young people. Relationships between EFs and short-term housing outcomes were also explored. Sixty-eight homeless young people (16-19 years) and 37 age-matched housed young people participated in this study. Computerized EF tasks spanned the domains of working memory, set shifting/flexibility, planning, impulsivity/risky decision making, selective attention/inhibition, and verbal fluency. Homeless young people demonstrated worse performance than housed youth on several EF tasks, particularly working memory and impulsivity/risky decision making. Working memory predicted progression into more independent accommodation; those with longer working memory spans were twice as likely to have progressed to more independent housing rather than maintained their current housing status after six months. Poorer EFs are associated with youth homelessness and also with an individual's ability to progress towards independence. As such, EFs should not continue to be overlooked by researchers and service providers. Emerging adulthood, as a sensitive period for EF development, is an opportune time for intervention to increase the likelihood of positive housing outcomes in homeless young people.Copyright © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Background Our hospital serves a population with some of the greatest deprivation in the UK. Childrenoften attend with acute safeguarding concerns. We estimated 30 children per year are discharged toemergency foster car Aims To provide these children with backpacks of essential and comforting items to help make thisexperience slightly less terrifying. To quantify the need for these backpacks. To collect feedback for quality improvement purposes. Methods With trust funding and charitable donations we created backpacks for all ages and genders. Thecontents, advised by looked after children, included pyjamas, underwear, toiletries with age appropriatetoys and gifts. Demographics and reasons for receiving backpacks were recorded on an excel database.Feedback was on a formal proforma and through observation and conversation. Results Over 18 months, 56 children's backpacks were distributed (table 1), a larger number thanpredicted. The cost was 2050 (average 36.60 per backpack). Table 1 shows recipient numbers by ageand gender. Feedback has been almost universally positive: 'An amazing idea and will mean that children won't have to enter care with nothing which is often thecase.' Police 'It brought a smile to my daughter's face' Mother 'It's like Christmas all over again' Teenage boy 'Their face lit up' Nurse Several neonatal bags were given as the mothers were destitute. Children of three mothers fleeingdomestic abuse also received them. Recipients aged 16+ years, include a 23-year-old who was traffickedand pregnant, and a 17-year-old with learning difficulties, also pregnant and fleeing physical and sexual assault. Discussion A large international company has taken on fundraising for this project, expanding it to majorhospitals in other cities with our assistance. There is notable overlap of vulnerable children and adults, particularly through trafficking, destitution anddomestic abuse. Approximately 3 women a week present through our A+E requiring emergencyaccommodation due to domestic violence or trafficking. We have accordingly extended our project toprovide them with similar backpacks. Contents include oyster cards, mobile phones and information onlocal services to aid their movement onwards. Conclusion We have shown this resource is sustainable and extremely valued by recipients. We haveextended the project to help vulnerable adults and, with the right financial support, it is scalable acrossthe UK.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Children raised in poverty commonly face unmet basic needs, such as food insecurity and unstable housing, and are at higher likelihood of exposure to violence. As a result of these unmet social needs, they are more likely to experience poorer health than children from more advantageous background. The link between social determinants of health and well-being is not limited to children. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends universal screening for social determinants of health at all well-child checks, however there was no standardized system for screening children or adults at the University of Chicago Primary Care Group Medicine- Pediatrics clinic, which serves primarily low-income families on Chicago's South Side. We aimed to design and implement a protocol for universal screening of social determinants of health at every well child visit, then expand to include adult physicals. METHOD(S): The validated WE CARE and IHELLP social determinants of health screening tools were modified to create a specific survey for our clinic, in collaboration between physicians and the clinic social worker. Based on identified community needs, our screening tool focused on housing insecurity, food insecurity, difficulty paying for utilities, difficulty with transportation to medical appointments, need for childcare, and exposure to domestic or community violence. We ensured all modifications maintained appropriate language for families with low health literacy. The medical assistants distributed the survey during the rooming process for every well-child check in our clinic, and now expanded to all adult physicals. Practitioners reviewed the questionnaire during the visit. If any the questions screened positive, shared a standardized resource with a list of community services that addressed the specific need. RESULT(S): In our initial sample of 93 screened families, 19% of our screeners were positive in one or more category. Of the positives, 44% were positive in two or more categories. The most common needs raised were affordable childcare (9.6%, n=9) and paying for utilities (8.6%, n=8). Five percent of our population screened positive for food insecurity and two percent positive for housing insecurity. Nearly all families that screened positive in one or more area were interested in receiving resources to address their needs. CONCLUSION(S): Physicians have the capability to impact the link between unmet basic needs and health. We implemented a screening process for social determinants of health within an academic medicinepediatrics clinic using a team-based care model and found a high rate of positive social determinants of health. By identifying unmet basic needs and linking families with appropriate community services, we can intervene and help support better health in the South Side of Chicago, impacting both short and long-term health. We are currently in the process of surveying families that screened positive to determine the effectiveness of our intervention and areas for improvement.

N2  - Background and Aims: The introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has revolutionised treatment of hepatitis C but reinfections among those who share injection drug paraphernalia can jeopardize efforts to eliminate HCV infection as a public health threat. Risk of reinfection has been reported to be higher among younger patients and those who mainly use stimulants. The Treatment as Prevention for Hepatitis C in Iceland (TraP Hep C), was started in 2016 in Iceland, offering treatment with DAAs to all HCV-infected individuals. We sought to determine the incidence of HCV reinfections among patients in the program. Method(s): Background clinical data was gathered prospectively. The study cohort was limited to patients who completed treatment and achieved sustained virological response (SVR) between January 11th 2016-November 20th 2018, and thus had >1 year of observation following cure. In addition, viral genotypes and viral deep sequencing results were reviewed. The observed follow-up time from confirmed SVR to the most recent HCV PCR was used to calculate the period for each individual and the reinfection rate/100 person- years (PYs) for the patient cohort. In addition, to account for low-risk patients in the cohort we also approximated the theoretical minimum reinfection rate, by the assumption that every patient with last HCV PCR listed as negative had remained negative until November 20th 2019. Result(s): A total of 617 treatments of 597 patients (409 males, average age 44,5 years) were completed with confirmed SVR. During follow-up, 44 reinfections occurred in 42 patients (9 female, 33 male). The total follow-up was 494,7 PYs with an average time to a positive HCV PCR test of 380 days. History of IDU was reported by 508 (85%) and recent IDU with 205 (33%) treatments. Stimulants were the preferred iv drug among 85%. The observed overall reinfection rate was 8,9/100 PYs (95% CI 5.8-13.6). High reinfection rates were associated with homelessness (24,3/100 PYs), recent IDU (reinfection rate 18,1/100 PYs), concomitant IDU and use of non-intravenous stimulants (reinfection rate 26,2/100 PYs), and young age (20-24 years; reinfection rate 24/100 PYs). The theoretical (calculated) observation period for the total cohort was 1502 PYs and thus the lowest theoretical minimum reinfection rate in Iceland was 2,9/100 PYs (95% CI 1,9-4,5). Most reinfected patients have been successfully retreated. Conclusion(s): The observed reinfection rate after successful DAA treatment in Iceland is high and seems to be segregated to young marginalized people who continue to use drugs and those who have unstable housing. The inherent bias towards repeat blood tests in high-risk patients may lead to an overestimate of reinfection rates. Further emphasis on people at the highest risk of reinfection is challenging, but essential in order to maintain the effectiveness of treatment and further reduce HCV transmission.Copyright © 2020 European Association for the Study of the Liver

N2  - Purpose: This scoping review's primary objective is to summarise and critically appraise the available evidence on Integrative Medicine (IM) practices in underresourced US populations and summarize data on outcomes. Method(s): This first-ever scoping review of IM clinical trials in underserved populations in the United States, included search terms: homeless, uninsured, native American, refugee, low income, poor, poverty, or underserved. Inclusion intervention criteria were Acupuncture, Oriental Medicine, Chinese medicine, Asian medicine, herbal medicine, chiropractic, massage therapy, naturopathic medicine, naturopathy, complementary medicine, alternative medicine, integrative medicine, integrative health, yoga, yoga therapy, ayurvedic medicine, ayurveda, homeopathy, certified professional Midwives, and direct-entry midwives. IM paradigms and components; study designs and methodology; controls; population; intervention and setting descriptors; modes of delivery; training of intervention providers; health outcomes; study funding; and innovative study features were systematically extracted. Result(s): In this study, 47 articles through 2019; 40 unique research projects; 6 research projects with 2 to 3 papers were identified. Findings demonstrate that research in lowincome/ underserved populations should explore all social precursors of disease and a cascade effect, in which cooccurring vulnerabilities create fertile soil for both chronic and acute conditions. Data show relationships between social precursors and poor diet, lifestyle and habits that exacerbate poor mental health and substance use, contributing to lower overall quality of life. Structural inequalities, discrimination and lack of social support play major roles in the health status of the populations studied. Conclusion(s): Data show that IM interventions are being implemented in 2 primary populations: magnifying prevention and risk reduction strengths of the paradigm for youth; and effective treatment for lifestyle-related chronic conditions in adults >/+ 45 years. The data draw attention to advantages and benefits of multimodal interventions for conditions that are multivariate in nature. Innovative features of IM study designs include a focus on empowerment/ agency; attentional control; self-regulation/ compassion; resilience and improved self-efficacy; as well as centering movement therapy and self-care skills.

N2  - Purpose: Food insecurity occurs in 13.9% of households with children in the United States, and the chance of being diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) is nearly 6 times greater in food insecure households. Yet, few studies exist exploring this relationship, particularly from the perspective of dietary patterns and nutrient intake. The purpose of this study is to explore relationships among food insecurity status, Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores, and ADHD symptoms severity in a pediatric ADHD population. Method(s): These data were collected as part of baseline assessments from a clinical trial investigating an alternative treatment for ADHD in children ages 6 to 12 years (n=91). Household food security status was assessed using the 18- Item US Household Food Security Survey, and symptom severity of ADHD was assessed using the Child andAdolescent Symptom Inventory-5 questionnaire. HEI scores were calculated by administering the Vioscreen Food Frequency Questionnaire. Statistical analyses included 1- way analysis of variance and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests when appropriate for model assumptions. Result(s): Children in food insecure households (n=8) scored higher in hyperactivity symptoms than food secure children (n= 83) (P=.050). The mean cohort total HEI score was 64.7 (SD 9.25), which is higher than reported for the general population of similar age. Children from food insecure households reported decreased HEI score for intake of fatty acids (P=.008) and increased HEI score for empty calorie consumption (P=.036). Conclusion(s): Results demonstrate that relationships may exist between severity of symptoms of ADHD and dietary quality as measured by HEI scores in food insecure households. Future analyses should test for existing dietary patterns outside of HEI scores in relationship to food insecurity and ADHD symptoms.

N2  - Background: Economic vulnerability, such as homelessness and unemployment, contributes to HIV risk among U.S. racial minorities. Yet, few economicstrengthening interventions have been adapted for HIV prevention in this population. Method(s): This study assessed the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial of a 20-week microenterprise intervention for economically vulnerable African-American young adults. Engaging MicroenterprisE for Resource Generation and Health Empowerment (EMERGE) aimed to reduce sexual risk behaviors and increase employment and uptake of HIV preventive behaviors. The experimental group received text messages on job openings plus educational sessions, mentoring, a start-up grant, and business and HIV prevention text messages. Primary feasibility objectives assessed recruitment, randomization, participation, and retention. Secondary objectives examined employment, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV preventive behaviors. Result(s): Thirty-eight (n=38) participants were randomized to experimental (n=19) or comparison group (n=19) of which 95% were retained. Mean age of participants was 20.1 years; 35% were male; 81% were unemployed. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of experimental participants completed > 70% of intervention activities, and 74% completed > 50% of intervention activities. Participation in intervention activities and outcome assessments was highest in the first half (~ 10 weeks) of the study. The experimental group reported higher employment (from 32% at baseline to 83% at week 26) and lower unprotected sex (79% to 58%) over time compared to reported changes in employment (37% to 47%) and unprotected sex (63% to 53%) over time in the comparison group. Conclusion(s): Conducting this feasibility randomized clinical trial was a critical step in the process of designing and testing a behavioral intervention.

N2  - Background: In 2020, the United States Preventative Services Task Force updated its guidance for chronic hepatitis C (HCV) screening from cohort screening of individuals born between 1945-1965 or with risk factors to universal screening for all adults aged 18-79 The emergency department (ED) is a unique environment for HCV screening and the portal of entry for many at risk individuals who are not seen in traditional settings This study aimed to compare cohort screening in ambulatory care clinics (ACC) with universal screening in the ED Methods: HCV screening initiatives were established in the ED and ACC in our health system The ED utilized a best practice alert to identify patients born after 1945 and >=18 years who underwent phlebotomy as potential candidates Upon the alert, ED providers used an opt-out approach for testing Patient navigators disclosed results, conducted disease prevention and linked patients to care For the ACC initiative, pharmacists collaborated with the primary care providers in six clinics Pharmacists provided education to providers on HCV screening and treatment Providers 'opted-into' the program, in which pharmacists identified patients using a pre-existing best practice alert for birth years 1945-1965, notified those indicated for screening, placed orders and reviewed results with patients Patients were screened for HCV antibody and positive results were followed by viral load testing. Reflex testing was utilized in the ED; however, was unavailable in the ACC Our primary outcome was HCV antibody seroprevalence in patients screened from June 6, 2019 to June 5, 2020 between the ACC and ED Results: There were 1,296 and 12,801 patients screened in the ACC and ED, respectively Subjects screened in the ED were younger and there was a higher prevalence of Medi-CAL insured and homeless patients In the ACC, 13 patients (1%) screened positive for HCV antibody, nine (69%) completed the subsequent viral load test and of those one was positive (11%) In the ED, 1,055 patients (8%) screened positive for HCV antibody and 876 (82%) underwent reflex viral load testing, which was positive in 382 patients (44%) Demographics are shown in Table 1 Conclusion(s): Within our health system, universal HCV screening was more effective than birth-cohort HCV screening Furthermore, this study shows that the ED continues to be an important setting for HCV screening to access populations not receiving routine care.

N2  - Background: Although the AAP Section on Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine has prioritized advocacy as a mission goal, neonatal-perinatal medicine (NPM) fellow trainees have limited opportunities for local advocacy due to their rigorous clinical and research requirements and difficulty translating neonatology intensive care training goals into advocacy efforts. However, as general pediatricians and experts in caring for neonates, trainees are in a unique position to lead outreach projects focused on mothers and their infants. Objective(s): To determine the feasibility of a fellow-led community-based advocacy initiative during fellowship training. Design/Methods: Starting in 2016, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) NPM Fellowship Program partnered with the Homeless Health Initiative and Mother's Home, a residential shelter in a low-income Philadelphia suburb for vulnerable pregnant and post-partum women and their infants. Each month, all members of the Neonatology division are invited to attend. A multi-disciplinary team of NICU providers joins NPM fellows to lead monthly hour-long sessions on maternal and newborn health. Result(s): Since 2016, NPM fellows organized and led 30 sessions covering 12 core subjects in maternal and newborn health. To date, over 20 NICU providers (neonatology attendings, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, residents, social workers, and psychologists) have participated, with 6.9 +/- 3.5 mothers per session. The work was presented to shelter staff and community leaders at CHOP Homeless Health Initiative's Day of Dialogue on infants in shelters. The initiative was awarded a "PennCares" grant by the University of Pennsylvania in 2017 to support advocacy projects. The success of the project led CHOP NICU nurses to organize their own sessions through the Delaware Valley Association of Neonatal Nurses. Future qualitative surveys will determine the efficacy of the sessions. Conclusion(s): Fellow-led community-based outreach is both feasible and sustainable during Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine fellowship training. The Mother's Home partnership provides valuable education to disadvantaged pregnant women and mothers to improve the care of their children, builds community relations, enhances multidisciplinary relationships within the NICU, and provides education to NPM trainees on advocacy project development and delivery. This project exemplifies that fellow-led advocacy initiatives can be incorporated into fellowship training goals across all disciplines.

N2  - Introduction Adolescent nutrition is a crucial period for growth, nutrition and development and serves as an important window for promotion of optimal intergenerational health, nutrition, and well-being as an adult(Patton et al., 2016; Prentice et al., 2013). While maternal and child nutrition have received unprecedented political and financial commitment in recent decades, the emerging focus on policies on programs specific to adolescents (10-19 years), has been accompanied by calls to fill data gaps related to adolescent health and nutrition (Haberland et al., 2018; Bhutta et al., 2017). This analysis aims to describe dietary quality, nutritional status, and other individual and contextual factors related to adolescent nutrition in Nepal. Methods In 2017, utilizing a multi-stage cluster sampling approach, data was collected among 3,648 randomly selected households with a child 0-5 years, from 192 randomly selected program wards. Within these households, in addition to interviewing the mothers and a major household decision-maker, an adolescent girl (n = 837) was also randomly selected for inclusion, when available. We excluded adolescent mothers from the analysis (n = 67). We carried out disaggregated descriptive analyses by age: younger (Y) (10-14 years, n = 515) versus older (O) (15-19 years, n = 255) for nutritional status (BMI-for-age using WHO methodology), diet diversity (using the Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women indicator with a cut-off of 5 + of 10 food groups), nutrition-related health and nutrition exposure, knowledge, and behaviors, and contextual factors such as wealth, caste/ethnicity, number of household members, food security, and school attendance. Results Mean age of adolescent girls participating in the study was 13.7 years (s.d 2.7) and 62% of the girls belonged to the younger age group. Almost half of the adolescents were from socially excluded ethnic group and around 40% resided in food insecure households. The prevalence of overweight/obesity adolescents in this sample was low (3%) among both younger and older girls, but the prevalence of underweight was higher among younger adolescents (Y: 44%, O: 28%, P < 0.001). Similarly, a larger proportion of older adolescent girls attained minimum dietary diversity (Y: 31%, O: 41%, P < 0.01). The prevalence of underweight also varied by agro-ecological zone: hills (Y: 41%, O:48%, P < 0.01) and terai (Y: 12%, O:28%, P < 0.001), as did dietary diversity: hills (Y:49%, O:27%, P < 0.001) and terai (Y:44%, O:31%, P < 0.001). Exposure to both health/family planning (Y: 20%, O: 41%, P < 0.001) and nutrition (Y: 26%, O: 41%, P < 0.05) information differed by age, as did exposure to messages on dietary diversity during pregnancy and lactation (Y: 50%, O: 83%, P < 0.001), ways to delay/ avoid pregnancy (Y: 32%, O: 84%, P < 0.001), and avoiding marriage until 18 years (Y: 83%, O: 97%, P < 0.001). While householdlevel factors were similar between younger and older adolescents, other differences of potential programmatic importance included whether currently in school (Y: 97%, O: 85%, P < 0.001); mobile phone ownership (Y: 7%, O: 50%, P < 0.001); use of radio (Y: 44%, O: 65%, P < 0.001); and whether self-efficacy was above average (Y: 34%, O: 45%, P < 0.001). Conclusions Nutrition-related outcomes and behaviours differ between younger and older adolescent girls in Nepal. Global discourse and research around adolescent health and nutrition requires greater nuance to address the differing circumstances of girls at different stages of adolescence. Consideration of the challenges faced by these sub-groups and how to reach and tailor interventions (e.g., schools, radio, SMS) could serve as vital next steps.

N2  - Parental psychosocial and mental health problems can have significant impact on child development (Gupta & Ford-Jones, 2014; WHO, 2008). There is emerging interest in, but limited evidence to date, on relationships between mental health and nutrition. We assessed associations between parental depression and child diets and nutritional status in Nepal. We used the Suaahara II cross-sectional monitoring survey data, collected June-September 2017, using a multi-stage cluster sampling design. In 3,642 randomly selected households with children less than 60 months, interviews were conducted with the mother and father (when available), and anthropometric data for all children were collected using standardized procedures. For this analysis, we included households in which the child was 6-59 months (n = 3,158 mothers; n = 826 fathers). Maternal and paternal depression were measured using the validated Nepalese version of PHQ-9. The value of each question in this screening tool ranges from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) and the total score ranges from 0 to 27, with a higher score indicating a higher probability of more depressive symptoms. A cut-off score of 10 or greater is generally considered screening positive for moderate or severe depression Nepal (Kohrt et al., 2016). Child dietary diversity scores were based on a 24-hour recall and grouping foods consumed into seven standard food groups. Child anthropometry indicators included: length/height-for-age z score (L/HAZ), weight-for-length/height z score (WL/HZ), and weight-for-age z score (WAZ). We used linear and logistic regressions to examine associations between depression of each parent and child dietary diversity and anthropometry, adjusting for the following socio-demographic and economic factors: parental age and years of schooling, household type, number of children under five, caste/ethnicity, agroecological zone of residency, equity quintile, and food security status. Among this sample population, 4.7% of mothers and 3.3% of fathers screened positive for moderate or severe depression (PHQ-9 score >= 10). Child mean dietary diversity score was 3.6, and 55% of children met the cut-off of consuming foods from at least four of seven food groups. The mean L/HAZ, WL/HZ, and WAZ scores were -1.35, -0.77, and -1.28, respectively. The percentage of children stunted, wasted and underweight were 28%, 11%, and 23% respectively. Neither maternal nor paternal depression were associated with child dietary diversity or child anthropometric z-scores after controlling for potential confounders. However, having more than one child under five years in the household (beta = -0.09, p < 0.05), being from an upper caste group (beta = 0.13, p < 0.01), from the terai region (beta = -0.80, p < 0.001), maternal years of schooling (beta = 0.04, p < 0.001) and highest equity quintile of the households (beta = 0.63, p < 0.001) were important determinants of child dietary diversity. For child anthropometric outcomes, being from the hills had a negative association (beta = -0.22, p < 0.01 for L/HAZ; beta = -0.18, p < 0.01 for WH/LZ; and beta = -0.25, p < 0.00 for WAZ), whereas being from the highest equity quintile (beta = 0.56, p < 0.00 for L/HAZ; beta = 0.32, p < 0.001 for WH/LZ; and beta = 0.54, p < 0.001 for WAZ) and mother having more years of schooling (beta = 0.03, p < 0.00 for L/HAZ; beta = 0.02, p < 0.001 for WH/LZ; and beta = 0.03, p < 0.001 for WAZ) had positive associations Parental depression was not significantly associated with child diet or growth. While improving mental health is important, it does not show as a likely intervention point for improving diets and nutritional status in Nepal. However, our findings show that programs and policies will also need to target the poor, socially marginalized and food insecure households to address nutrition problems.

N2  - Background: Homelessness is a problem in urban communities worldwide particularly when children fend for themselves on the street. Haematology is greatly influenced by proper nourishment and care in growing children. Aim(s): The study's aim was to assess the socio-demographic profile and some haematological parameters of children living on the street in Calabar, Nigeria. Method(s): A total of 180 male and female children aged between 6 and 16 years, were enrolled, comprising ninety children living on the street at Mary Slessor Avenue and Lemna Road, Calabar. Withparental consent, ninety healthy, age and gender-matched children who live in homes were selected from Lourdes Academy, a private school in Calabar, as control. Socio-Demographic data was compiled by interview. Weight and height were measured and body mass index (BMI) calculated. The packed cell volume, haemoglobin, total white cell and platelet counts were determined by standard manual techniques. Serum iron and total iron binding capacity were determined by colorimetry, serum ferritin by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay while transferrin saturation was calculated. Data were analyzed using student t-test on statistical package for social sciences version 21. Significance was set at P <= 0.05. Result(s): Results showed that more males were found on the street (53.3%) with the majority (82.2%) having no formal education. All children living on the street depend fully on the street, 62.2% benefits from support groups with 60% engaged in odd jobs. The BMI of children on the street was significantly lower while total white cell count was significantly higher (P < 0.05) versus those at home. Other measured parameters were comparable (P > 0.05). Conclusion(s): The lower BMI of children living on the street implies slower growth compared to control while higher white cell count suggests a response to exposure to infectious agents and environmental hazards.

N2  - Introduction: Recent evidence shows an increase in alcohol-related emergency department (ED) visits among youth. We sought to quantify the impact of ED visits (type and frequency, patient characteristics and resource use) related to alcohol in our centre. Method(s): This was a chart review of patients aged 12-24 with alcohol-related ED visits between Sept 2013-Aug 2017. The National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) database was searched for visits alcohol related ICD-10 codes. The Canadian Hospital Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) database was also searched using the keyword alcohol. Duplicate visits were removed. Visits were excluded if patients had a history of psychosis, were held in the ED for psychiatric assessment, were homeless, were inmates from a correctional institute, if alcohol use was not mentioned and for complaints of sexual assault/intimate partner violence. Data was abstracted by two reviewers using a standard form with predetermined variables. Differences were resolved with third party adjudication. Interrater reliability of the reviewers was assessed with Kappa scores through duplicate review of 10% of randomly selected charts. A further 10% were assessed by a 3rd reviewer for extraction accuracy. Result(s): 3, 256 ED visits were identified with 777 removed via predefined exclusion criteria. 2, 479 visits were reviewed with a male predominance (54.3%). More than half of all patients (50.9%) arrived via ambulance. Assigned CTAS levels were Resuscitation: 1% Emergent: 9.9% Urgent: 48.2% Less Urgent: 35.7% Non-Urgent: 4.2% (missing 1%). The median LOS was 2.9 hrs (IQR 1.8-4.6). All visits were sub-classified into mutually exclusive categories: injury (51.8%), acute intoxication (45.1%) and mental health issue (3.2%). Males were more likely to present with injury (62.4% vs 42.6%, p < 0.01). Females were more likely to present with acute intoxication (53.3% vs 46.7%, p <0.01) and mental health issues (59.5% vs 40.5%, P = 0.01). ED resource use was notable: 483 (19.4%) had imaging tests and 1216 (49.1%) had some medical intervention (blood test, fluids or medication). 57 (2.3%) patients were admitted and there was one death from an alcohol related MVC. Conclusion(s): Alcohol-related ED visits by youth are common in our centre and utilize substantial prehospital and in-hospital resources. Identification of effective harm reduction strategies should be a research priority.

N2  - Introduction: Recent evidence shows an increase in alcohol-related emergency department (ED) visits among youth. Highly publicized collegiate rituals such as Homecoming may create a climate for problematic alcohol use. This study describes the frequency of youth alcohol-related ED visits per year and during pre-specified ritualized drinking dates in one academic centre. Method(s): This was a chart review of patients aged 12-24 with alcohol-related ED presentations between Sept 2013-Aug 2017. The National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) database was searched for visits with ICD-10 codes related to alcohol. The Canadian Hospital Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) database was also searched using the keyword alcohol. Duplicate visits were removed. Visits were excluded if patients had a history of psychosis, were held in the ED for involuntary psychiatric assessment, were homeless, were inmates from a correctional institute, if alcohol use was not mentioned and for complaints of sexual assault/domestic violence. Data abstraction by two reviewers used a standard form with variables predetermined. Differences were resolved with third party adjudication. Interrater reliability of the reviewers was assessed through duplicate review of 10% of randomly selected charts. A further 10% were assessed by a 3rd reviewer for extraction accuracy. Result(s): A total of 3, 256 ED visits were identified with 777 meeting exclusion criteria. The remaining 2, 479 visits were reviewed and subclassified into injury (51.8%), acute intoxication (45.1%) and mental health issue (3.2%). Interrater agreement was high for extracted variables with Kappa scores > 0.8. Despite a decrease in the region's youth population during the study period (28, 325 to 25, 125), overall standardized ED visits by youth increased by 12% (66, 538 to 78, 129). Adjusted for population, youth alcohol-related visits increased by 86.4% from 1, 557 in 2013-14 to 2, 902 in 2016-17. Co-ingestion of other substances was reported in 292 (11.8%) of visits, with cannabis the most common (57%). The 17 pre-specified ritualized days saw 578 (23.3%) of ED visits. Conclusion(s): Alcohol-related ED visits in youth are increasing in our region. Ritualized drinking dates appear to be particularly risky for youth with high rates of observed ED utilization. Strategies to manage high volume ritual days are being piloted, including temporary diversion to an in-hospital sobriety centre.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep and circadian factors play an important role in school attendance, academic performance, and daytime behaviors among adolescents. This investigation assessed school night sleep duration (SNSD) and circadian preference (CP) association with first period tardies (FPT) using a middle-aged sample from the Madison (Wisconsin) Metropolitan School District (MMSD), prior to implementation of a planned district-wide delay in middle school start times. Method(s): 4,175 middle-school aged students from 12 MMSD schools completed a sleep survey, which included SNSD and a validated 4-level measure of CP. Self-reported SNSD between 4-and- 12 hours served as final sample inclusion criterion. Mixed effects modeling was employed with students nested within school. Linear regression determined SNSD and CP effect on student tardiness. Individual, year-long FPT served as outcome variable. Inclusion of SNSD quadratic term was not statistically indicated. Full model covariates included age, sex, race, parent educational level, homelessness, free and reduced lunch, and special education status. Result(s): Final sample included 3,860 students. Univariate regression determined a significant CP association with FPT [beta=1.20, 95% CI (0.54, 1.86), F(1,10.41)=13.7, p=0.004), but not SNSD [beta=-0.31, 95% CI (-0.70, -0.09), F(1,10.21)=2.5, p=0.14]. SNSD and CP interaction was not significant. CP significance was maintained in the full model [beta=1.24, 95% CI (-0.70, -0.09), F(1,11.21)=13.7, p=0.004]. Evening preference associated with 3.72 more FPT, relative to morning preference. Conclusion(s): Results suggest evening preference is associated with increased risk of tardiness among middle school students. Future research that examines the relationships between delayed school start times, circadian preference, and impact on school tardiness is indicated.

T1  - 59.5 INTERFACING WITH MENTAL HEALTH CARE: PERSPECTIVE FROM A COMMUNITY YOUTH ACTIVIST
T3  - 67th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry. Chicago United States.
A1  - Elmore N. 
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Objectives: Homelessness is experienced by youth and families throughout the United States. To truly address homelessness and understand the structural determinants of health that lead to homelessness, it is essential for mental health providers to partner with and listen to the perspectives of youth community activists with lived experiences. Method(s): Nicole Elmore, BA, is a community youth activist and program assistant for Opportunities for All in San Francisco, where she works with youth in workforce development. She will share her own experiences in the community with the structural determinants of health related to homelessness and her community advocacy as part of Mayor London Breed's Youth Initiative for Workforce Development, partnered with the San Francisco Human Rights Commission. Result(s): Ms. Elmore will share her perspective as a young adult and community activist with experience in family homelessness, family incarceration, interaction with the mental health system, and the impact of gentrification, along with her work with youth in developing employment skills, to advance the knowledge of mental health clinicians as advocates and allies for youth undergoing similar experiences. Conclusion(s): Advocacy is an essential role for mental health clinicians. Understanding how to best partner with young adults to address homelessness, disparities, and the structural factors related to homelessness, is critical for mental health clinicians when addressing the homelessness crisis. Clinicians are best able to empower youth by elevating platforms in which those with direct experiences can be heard. ADVCopyright © 2020

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Objectives: The objectives of this presentation are: 1) to understand the phenomenon of commercial sexual exploitation (CSE) through the voice of lived experience and to learn new skills to improve engagement of these youth in care; 2) to master strategies for prevention and intervention for CSE and other forms of trafficking through a model, family-based prevention intervention for homeless youth and an intersectoral public health approach; 3) to learn about an innovative, survivor-centered adapted reproductive health curriculum for exploited youth utilizing survivor engagement as a model of best practice for the development and implementation of strategies to target the needs of youth involved in CSE. Method(s): Presentations will incorporate research, clinical care, personal accounts, and systems of care perspectives. Maria Contreras, a survivor and former direct service provider, will share her lived experience and the experiences of other victims. Dawn Bounds, PhD, will present a model family-based intervention for homeless youth at risk for CSE. Sarah Godoy, MSW, and Eraka Bath, MD, will present a model of intervention development in which survivors were engaged to adapt and implement an evidence-based reproductive health curriculum. Suzan Song, MD, MPH, PhD, will present an overview of policy reports/studies, personal clinical experiences with at-risk youth in multiple systems of care, and an intersectoral public health approach to trafficking. Dr. Bath will engage the audience in a lively clinical discussion with the panel of experts. Multiple audience engagement techniques will be used. Result(s): Survivor voices are crucial to understanding the complexities of CSE and in developing optimal interventions to best serve this population. Successful prevention and intervention strategies involve early identification of at-risk youth in the systems of care where they present, sensitivity, effective engagement, and maximization of family and systemic supports. Conclusion(s): Psychiatrists and other mental health providers have a unique opportunity to identify youth at-risk for CSE and to intervene sensitively in the systems of care where they present. The innovative strategies presented in this forum will substantially augment their understanding and skills and empower them to effectively intervene and significantly improve outcomes for these youth.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Objectives and expected outcomes of the workshop: Infants and young children are frequently present during episodes of domestic violence. Infants and young children are more likely to experience higher levels of trauma compared to older children but remain under-represented in the trauma literature and underserviced in the community generally (Lieberman et al., 2015). This presentation provide participants with an overview of a PhD thesis which involved 8 women's Refuges in three different countries to explore how Refuge provides 'refuge' to infants and theirmothers post leaving family violence. The presentation will explain the methodology of the research, look at the findings and discuss the implications for practice. This involves what workers within Refuge, as well as what other professionals, including maternal child health nurses, early childhood educators and infant mental health workers may offer this cohort of 'most at risk' infants and their mothers (Bunston, 2015; Bunston & Glennen, 2015).

N2  - Background: Substance use is commonly reported among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH). However, less is known about the use of multiple substances (polysubstance use), or factors related to polysubstance use among YEH. The present study sought to identify subgroups of YEH based on their recent polysubstance use behavior, and investigate traumatic experiences, mental health and social network composition as predictors of polysubstance use. Method(s): Adolescents and young adults (N = 1,046; Mage = 21.3) were recruited from three dropin centers serving homeless youth in Los Angeles, California. Participants completed an in-person survey and social network interview. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subgroups of youth based on nine different substance use behaviors in the past 30 days; multinomial logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with classmembership, adjusting for covariates. Result(s): Five polysubstance use classes were identified: heavy alcohol and marijuana (34.5%), primarily illicit drug use (3.6%), high all use (14.7%), primarilymarijuana (19.4%), and low use (27.7%). Relative to the low use class, number of traumatic experiences was associated with higher odds of membership in every polysubstance use class. One or more suicide attempts were associated with higher odds of membership in the high all class (OR = 9.56). Depression and PTSD symptoms were not associated with class membership. Number of substance-using, homeless network members (OR = 1.36) was associated withmembership in the heavy alcohol andmarijuana use class, while the number of non-substance-using network members (homeless [OR = 0.28] and non-homeless [OR = 0.72]) was associated with lower odds of membership in the high all class. Conclusion(s): Distinct groups of YEH can be identified by their recent polysubstance use patterns. In addition to demographic factors, traumatic experiences, suicidality, and affiliation with substanceusing, homeless individuals are risk factors for hazardous polysubstance use. Affiliation with nonsubstance using individualsmay have protective effects for some YEH. These predictors of polysubstance have implications both for the prevention and treatment of substance use disorders among YEH.

N2  - Purpose of study Coincident with increased legalization, marijuana (MJ) use is increasing among pregnant women and women of reproductive age. However, mothers' intention to breastfeed (BF) when using MJ around the time of pregnancy is unclear. Therefore we sought to compare intention to BF among mothers exclusively using MJ with those using electronic cigarettes (ecig), tobacco products, multi-substances, and non-users. Methods used This is an interim analysis of surveys from parents of live singletons merged with birth certificate data. Subjects were categorized into 5 groups: ecig use only (ECO), marijuana use only (MJO), tobacco products only (TPO), multi-substance users (MSU; > 2 of, marijuana, illicit drugs, ecig & tobacco), & non-users (NU; neither ecig, tobacco, marijuana). Due to small numbers exclusive illicit drug users were not able to be analyzed separately. Intention to BF was compared across groups. Also assessed were adverse life events in the peri-conceptional period such as partner incarceration, job loss, & homelessness. Logistic regression controlled for race/ethnicity, age, education, & adverse life events. Summary of results Of 935 mothers: 1% were ECO, 3% were MJO, 9% were TPO, 9% were MSU, 78% were NU. In bivariate analysis, NU were older & ECO & MJO were younger. NU were more likely to be educated, married & along with ECO-employed. MSU had the highest rates of adverse life events. NU had the highest rates of intention to BF (78%) & were significantly higher than TPO and MSU (p's<0.001). MJO were just as resolved to BF as NU In adjusted models, there was no difference in intention to BF between MJO and NU. Conclusions Mothers using exclusive MJ are similarly committed to BF as non-users. As studies suggest providers focus on legal issues when counseling MJO mothers, our findings highlight the need for clinicians to discuss potential newborn exposure via BF in discussions with MJO women-both pre and postnatally.

N2  - Purpose: Adolescents with a family history of substance use have a greater likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors including illegal activity, early sexual initiation and substance use. Research suggests that about 25% of children are exposed to parental substance abuse before age 18. Many parents who use drugs cannot adequately care for their children because of incarceration, homelessness, extended periods of drug use, or enrollment in drug treatment. Understanding the unique needs of youth whose parents use drugs would yield targeted strategies that inform interventions aimed at promoting well-being among this population. We conducted a qualitative study to understand the needs and barriers of African American adolescents with a substance-abusing parent in Baltimore. Method(s): We conducted 60 to 75 minute in-depth interviews (N=29) with three participant types: parents with a history of drug use, young adults (18-24yo) who had a biological parent with a history of drug use and youth providers who had experience working with families affected by drug use. Participants completed a demographic questionnaire prior to the interview. All participants were African American and either lived or worked in Baltimore city. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed by a professional transcription company. Atlas.ti 8.0 was used as a data management system. Five research team members developed a code book, double coded all transcripts and analyzed inductively using a qualitative content analytic approach. Techniques such as constant comparisons, memo writing, and peer review were used to ensure credibility. Any discrepancies in coding were reconciled with the entire research team. All study procedures were approved by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board. Result(s): Participants were consistent in their assessment of the primary needs of youth affected by parental drug use: stability, safety and support. Basic needs such as stable housing, food and money were described as being unmet. Access to and awareness of safe spaces were identified as challenges for young people. Finally, participants noted that emotional support often left youth in these families feeling unloved, misunderstood and lacking guidance to make healthy decisions. Due to the complexity of families affected by drug use, consistent support from people, continued connections to resources and collaborations across systems were identified as strategies to offset the potentially negative influence of parental drug use on youth. Conclusion(s): Parental absence due to drug use creates more opportunities for negative, risky behaviors to occur among youth. Findings from the study deepen the understanding of how to support the well-being of youth impacted by parental drug use. Our findings highlight the value of including the voices of vulnerable families in research and exploring community-based strategies for addressing their needs. Furthermore, the needs and strategies described may be used to advance the research and practice of others who are investigating ways to mitigate the negative effects of childhood adversity.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Objective: The objective of this scoping review is to explore existing literature on primary care services for adult and adolescent homeless persons, map the evidence and identify gaps in the literature. Introduction: Homeless adults and adolescents have complicated health needs, increased need for services, and more barriers to care. Recipients of primary care services use less emergency and urgent care resources. More information is needed in order to tailor primary care services for this vulnerable population. Inclusion criteria: This review will consider studies with participants aged 13 years or older who are currently or previously homeless. Studies will be included regardless of type of primary care service, country of origin, healthcare delivery system, geographic location or cultural setting. Method(s): The proposed review will be conducted in accordance with the JBI methodology for scoping reviews. The search strategy aims to locate published and unpublished studies and will be adapted for each information source. The reference lists of selected studies will be screened for additional citations. The search will be limited to the English language, but not by date of publication. Databases to be searched include MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, Scopus, Embase, PsycINFO, PsychArticles, PsycEXTRA, Academic Search Premier and Web of Science. Gray literature and unpublished studies will be searched. After screening titles and abstracts, two independent reviewers will retrieve potentially relevant, full-text studies and extract data. Data will be presented in diagrammatic form, accompanied by a narrative summary.Copyright © 2020 JBI.

N2  - Aims: Homelessness is associated with poor health outcomes and increased use of hospital and emergency department (ED) services. Little is known about the duration of homelessness in relation to health care service use. The aim of this study was to examine the use of hospital and ED services among the homeless in Helsinki, Finland, and for the first time, to examine the relationship between service use and duration of homelessness. Method(s): Six hundred and eighty-three persons staying at least one night in a shelter between September 2009 and September 2010 were followed until the end of 2014. Using negative binominal regression analysis we calculated the use of hospital and ED services and compared the use with that of a matched control group (N=1361). We also analyzed service use in relation to the time spent homeless during follow-up. Result(s): The mean time spent homeless during the follow-up was 8.5 months, one third was temporarily homeless (less than 2% of the follow-up time), but recurrent episodes of homelessness were also common. The study group's incidence rate ratios for medical-surgical hospital days was 6.23 (95% CI: 4.73 to 8.21), for psychiatric hospital days 43.11 (95% CI: 23.02 to 80.74) and for ED visits 10.21 (95% CI: 8.77 to 11.90), compared with controls. The number of medical-surgical hospital days and ED visits/person-year increased as homelessness was prolonged, but the pattern was opposite for psychiatric hospital days. Conclusion(s): Homeless persons are heavy users of hospital and ED services, and there is also increased use among those temporarily homeless.

N2  - Finding fulfillment of basic psychological needs may be difficult for parents living in shelters after becoming homeless or after escaping violence. This study tested if experiencing nature was associated with the basic psychological needs of parents in shelters. Need satisfaction and need frustration were measured among parents in shelters (N = 160), with one measurement in the standard indoor context of the shelter and one measurement while experiencing nature. Experiencing nature was associated with enhanced need satisfaction (d = 0.28) and reduced need frustration (d = -0.24). The effect was especially pronounced for parents with young children. Our findings suggest that the physical environment matters for parents' basic psychological need fulfillment as they interact with their children in the context of sheltering. This finding opens a potential avenue for supporting parental functioning and resilience in the face of risk if these effects were to be replicated across settings using controlled experimental designs. At the very least, the findings may be discussed with practitioners and parents in the context of making shelter life and work more conducive to mental health and family functioning.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

N2  - Approximately one in 10 people experiencing homelessness have pets. Despite the psychosocial benefits derived from pet ownership, systemic and structural barriers can prevent this group from meeting their basic needs and exiting homelessness. A multilevel framework is proposed for improving the health and well-being of pet owners experiencing homelessness. Informed by a One Health approach, the framework identifies interventions at the policy, public, and direct service delivery levels. Policy interventions are proposed to increase the supply of petfriendly emergency shelters, access to market rental housing and veterinary medicine, and the use of a Housing First approach. At the public level, educational interventions are needed to improve knowledge and reduce stigma about the relationship between homelessness and pet ownership. Direct service providers can support pet owners experiencing homelessness by recognizing their strengths, connecting them to community services, being aware of the risks associated with pet loss, providing harm reduction strategies, documenting animals as emotional support animals, and engaging in advocacy. By targeting policies and service approaches that exacerbate the hardships faced by pet owners experiencing homelessness, the framework is a set of deliberate actions to better support a group that is often overlooked or unaccommodated in efforts to end homelessness.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

N2  - Background: Street-connected children and youth (SCY) in Kenya disproportionately experience preventable morbidities and premature mortality. We theorize these health inequities are socially produced and result from systemic discrimination and a lack of human rights attainment. Therefore, we sought to identify and understand how SCY's social and health inequities in Kenya are produced, maintained, and shaped by structural and social determinants of health using the WHO conceptual framework on social determinants of health (SDH) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) General Comment no. 17. Method(s): This qualitative study was conducted from May 2017 to September 2018 using multiple methods including focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, archival review of newspaper articles, and analysis of a government policy document. We purposively sampled 100 participants including community leaders, government officials, vendors, police officers, general community residents, parents of SCY, and stakeholders in 5 counties across Kenya to participate in focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. We conducted a thematic analysis situated in the conceptual framework on SDH and the CRC. Result(s): Our findings indicate that SCY's social and health disparities arise as a result of structural and social determinants stemming from a socioeconomic and political environment that produces systemic discrimination, breaches human rights, and influences their unequal socioeconomic position in society. These social determinants influence SCY's intermediary determinants of health resulting in a lack of basic material needs, being precariously housed or homeless, engaging in substance use and misuse, and experiencing several psychosocial stressors, all of which shape health outcomes and equity for this population. Conclusion(s): SCY in Kenya experience social and health inequities that are avoidable and unjust. These social and health disparities arise as a result of structural and social determinants of health inequities stemming from the socioeconomic and political context in Kenya that produces systemic discrimination and influences SCYs' unequal socioeconomic position in society. Remedial action to reverse human rights contraventions and to advance health equity through action on SDH for SCY in Kenya is urgently needed.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - Introduction: The unfolding COVID-19 pandemic has predictably followed the familiar contours of well established socioeconomic health inequities, exposing and often amplifying preexisting disparities. People living in homeless shelters are at higher risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared to the general population. The purpose of this study was to identify shelter characteristics that may be associated with higher transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Method(s): We conducted a cross-sectional assessment of five congregate shelters in Rhode Island. Shelter residents 18 years old and older were tested for SARS-CoV-2 from April 19-April 24, 2020. At time of testing, we collected participant characteristics, symptomatology, and vital signs. Shelter characteristics and infection control strategies were collected through a structured phone questionnaire with shelter administrators. Result(s): A total of 299 shelter residents (99%, 299/302) participated. Thirty-five (11.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Shelter-level prevalence ranged from zero to 35%. Symptom prevalence did not vary by test result. Shelters with positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 were in more densely populated areas, had more transient resident populations, and instituted fewer physical distancing practices compared to shelters with no cases. Conclusion(s): SARS-CoV-2 prevalence varies with shelter characteristics but not individual symptoms. Policies that promote resident stability and physical distancing may help reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Symptom screening alone is insufficient to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Frequent universal testing and congregate housing alternatives that promote stability may help reduce spread of infection.Copyright: © 2020 Karb and Samuels et al.

N2  - Introduction: Young adults experiencing homelessness are at increased risk for sexual assault. Receiving a post-sexual assault examination has important implications for HIV and unintended pregnancy prevention; yet, utilization is not well understood. In a population at elevated risk for HIV, unintended pregnancy, and sexual violence, identifying barriers and facilitators to post-sexual assault examination is imperative. Method(s): As part of a large, multisite study to assess youth experiencing homelessness across 7 cities in the U.S, a cross-sectional survey was conducted between June 2016 and July 2017. Data were analyzed in 2019 to determine the prevalence and correlates of sexual violence and examine the correlates of post-sexual assault examination utilization. Result(s): Respondents (n=1,405), aged 18-26 years, were mainly youth of color (38% black, 17% Latinx) and identified as cisgender male (59%) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer (29%). HIV risks were high: 23% of participants had engaged in trade sex, 32% had experienced sexual assault as a minor, and 39% had experienced sexual exploitation. Young adults reported high rates of sexual assault (22%) and forced sex (24%). Yet, only 29% of participants who were forced to have sex received a post-sexual assault examination. Latinx young adults were more likely than other races/ethnicities to receive post-assault care. Participants frequently said they did not get a post-sexual assault exam because they did not want to involve the legal system and did not think it was important. Conclusion(s): Interventions are needed to increase use of preventive care after experiencing sexual assault among young adults experiencing homelessness.Copyright © 2019 American Journal of Preventive Medicine

N2  - Background NEETs (young people not in employment, education or training) are at higher risk for poorer mental and physical health. In France, the Missions locales (MLs) are the only social structures dedicated to this population. We sought to determine whether the systematic offer of a social and preventive medicine consultation at a ML might increase NEET participants' access to training in the 12 months following the intervention. Methods This intervention research was a parallel randomised controlled interventional study conducted at five MLs in mainland France in 2011-2012. It included 976 NEETs aged 18 to 25 years who attended one of the five MLs. At inclusion, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to three groups: those in the first group were invited to see a social worker (not studied in this paper), those in the second group were invited to see a doctor and a social worker (intervention group), and the third was a control group. The primary outcome was participation in at least one training session during the year following study inclusion. Results Among the 976 participants, 504 were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 472 to the control group; 704 (72.1%) were included in the analyses. A significantly higher proportion of the participants in the intervention group participated in a training session in the 12 months following the intervention than of those in the control group (63.3% vs 55.6%; p = 0.04). This difference was significantly greater for women, those less than 21 years of age, those unstably housed and those with a lower level of education. Conclusions Social and preventive medicine consultations that are fully integrated into the social services for NEETs have an impact on their access to training and contribute to changing some of their health-related behaviours. This may improve their access to the labour market.Copyright © 2019 Robert et al.

N2  - Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) have a high risk of contracting HIV; however, they remain relatively unreached by pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-based HIV prevention initiatives. We used a cross-sectional mixed-methods study to explore PrEP knowledge, interest, facilitators, and barriers among YEH. Young adults were recruited from agencies serving YEH in Houston, TX (n = 30) and Los Angeles, CA (n = 15) to participate in an electronic self-report survey and a semistructured interview. Survey results indicate that 68.2% of YEH had low or no prior knowledge of PrEP, though 63.7% reported interest in taking PrEP. Qualitative results revealed facilitators of PrEP use, including high PrEP acceptability and awareness, and supportive social networks. Several barriers emerged, including medication-related barriers, adherence, cost, access barriers, low perceived HIV risk, perceived stigma of PrEP use, and low PrEP awareness. Despite high PrEP acceptability, PrEP use among YEH remains low partly due to low PrEP awareness, low perceived HIV risk, and medical mistrust.Copyright © 2019 The Guilford Press.

N2  - Introduction: An 8-year-old girl presented to Temple Street Children's Hospital on 19/11/18 for a review appointment for left neurotrophic ulcer in a non-seeing eye. She has a background history of Neurofibromatosis type 2, left optic nerve meningioma and left corneal denervation. Case description: The patient developed a Stage 2 neurotrophic ulcer in her left eye in July 2018. This was being treated with Dexamethasone drops and ocular lubricants. She went on holidays in November 2018 and was swimming in the hotel pool. One day later her left eye became increasingly red. On return from holidays she attended Temple Street. Initial examination revealed hypopyon with an inferior corneal infiltrate 5mm x 2mm. She was admitted to hospital for hourly vancomycin and ceftazidime drops to left eye and oral Ciprofloxacin. The hypopyon slowly reduced in size over coming days. She received 7 days of intensive topical antibiotics and underwent a lateral tarsorrhaphy. She was discharged home on Prednisolone minims, Vitapos, Hyloforte and Chloramphenicol ointment. At her outpatient review one week later, Actrapid insulin in Systane 1 unit/ml eye drops were commenced three times daily in her left eye. The lateral tarsorrhaphy spontaneously opened one month later. The patients mother is very keen to avoid another one as it disfigures her. She already likes to wear glasses to try and hide her left eye. Over the following weeks this lead to a drastic improvement in her left corneal ulcer with the corneal epithelial defect decreasing in size. Discussion(s): Insulin is a widely available, safe and effective medication that has been shown to improve corneal re-epithelialisation in vitro and in diabetic animal models. In diabetic mice, topical insulin has been shown to slow the loss of sub-basal plexus corneal nerves. A recent study in the United States has demonstrated the efficacy of insulin drops. This study involved six patients with neurotrophic corneal ulcers that were refractory to a range of medical and surgical treatments. Each patient was started on topical insulin drops with complete corneal re-epithelialization within 7 to 25 days. Further studies are needed on this novel treatment This is the first documented case of this use of insulin in paediatric ophthalmology care in Ireland.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The paper presents two-year findings from a study investigating the effectiveness of Housing First (HF) with assertive community treatment (ACT) in helping individuals with serious mental illness, who are homeless or precariously housed and living in a small city, to become stably housed. METHOD(S): The research design was a parallel group non-blinded RCT with participants randomly assigned after the baseline interview to receive HF with ACT (N=100) or treatment as usual (TAU; N=101). Participants were interviewed every 3months over 21/24months to investigate changes on a range of housing and psychosocial outcomes. The primary outcomes were housing stability (as defined by a joint function of number of days housed and number of moves) and improvement in community functioning. Secondary predicted outcomes were improvements in self-rated physical and mental health status, substance use problems, quality of life, community integration, and recovery. RESULT(S): An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted. Compared to TAU participants, HF participants who entered housing did so more quickly (23.30 versus 88.25days, d=1.02, 95% CI [0.50-1.53], p<0.001), spent a greater proportion of time stably housed (Z=5.30, p<0.001, OR=3.12, 95% CI [1.96-4.27]), and rated the quality of their housing more positively (Z=4.59, p<0.001, d=0.43, 95% CI [0.25-0.62]). HF participants were also more likely to be housed continually in the final 6months (i.e., 79.57% vs. 55.47%), chi2 (2, n=170)=11.46, p=.003, Cramer's V=0.26, 95% CI [0.14-0.42]). HF participants showed greater gains in quality of life, (Z=3.83, p<0.001, ASMD=0.50, 95% CI [0.24-0.75]), psychological integration (Z=12.89, p<0.001, pooled ASMD=0.91, 95% CI [0.77-1.05]), and perceived recovery (Z=2.26, p=0.03, ASMD=0.39, 95% CI [0.05-0.74]) than TAU participants. CONCLUSION(S): The study indicates that HF ends homelessness significantly more rapidly than TAU for a majority of individuals with serious mental illness who have a history of homelessness and live in a small city. In addition, compared to TAU, HF produces psychosocial benefits for its recipients that include an enhanced quality of life, a greater sense of belonging in the community, and greater improvements in perceived recovery from mental illness.

N2  - The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program was reauthorized February 8, 2018, and invests $2 billion over 5 years to improve mothers' and children's outcomes across the life course. Along with this investment, the home-visiting field is striving for implementation innovations to deliver the greatest impact to the most families at the most efficient cost through a focus on precision home visiting. Consistent with the precision home-visiting approach to identify meaningful subgroups to guide content tailoring, the purpose of this paper is to answer (1) how and to what degree an evidence-based home-visiting model benefits mothers and children with substance use or depression and (2) what baseline characteristics indicate who can benefit most. We completed a secondary data analysis of the most recently completed randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Family Spirit (N= 322), a federally endorsed home-visiting intervention designed for young Native American mothers and their children. We examined how baseline differences in mothers' substance use, depression, and demographic characteristics (household mobility, education, parity, and premature birth) moderated mothers' and children's intervention-related outcomes. Children born to mothers with past substance use histories benefited more from the intervention than children born to abstinent mothers (p<0.01). Unstable housing, parity, and low educational attainment emerged as moderators of intervention effectiveness. Results from this investigation will serve as a basis for designing and evaluating a precision approach to Family Spirit and may provide lessons for other models to explore tailoring variables for optimal impact and efficiency.

N2  - This study aims to provide solutions to the problems of street children through Life Skill learning. The research was conducted at Master Depok Primay School, Indonesia. 20 children are active as street children to fulfill their daily needs as family economic demands. Qualitative Research Methods, are case studies, involving teachers who play a role in developing life skills, they are two class teachers and two life skill teachers. Determination of research subjects was carried out by using purposive sampling technique, the results were specifically street children 9 people, five people in grade 4 and four people in grade 6. The techniques of collecting data were through observation, structured interviews, and study documentation. The results showed that street children in Depok Master School were included in the children on the street group, it means, children who had economic activities as child laborers on the road, but they still had strong relationships with their parents. Part of their income on the road is given to their parents. To overcome these problems, the life skill learning process is very instrumental in the life process of street children, for this reason a teacher's strategy is needed in creating and innovating by continuing to improve pedagogical, personality, professional and social competencies. Support from various parties is needed to participate, both the government and the community to continue to provide guidance and supervision to parents that the act of releasing and letting children on the road, especially demanding them as breadwinners is illegal and violates children's rights.Copyright © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

N2  - Street children generally live in a less supportive environment, with inadequate facilities and infrastructure, and a lack of health information. These make street children vulnerable to health problems. Increasing motivation for a clean and healthy lifestyle in street children is a good solution to maintain their health. The Heath-Trace Map game is a learning media that can be used as motivation. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of the Health-Trace Map game as health education media towards motivation on clean and healthy lifestyles among street children. The One Group Pre-Post Test design was used in this study. 30 street children had joined this study. The Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test with a significant level of alpha < 0.05 was performed to analyse the data. The results showed the p value = 0,000 (p value < alpha = 0,05), from which it can be concluded that the Media Health Trace Map Game had an effect on increasing the Motivation of Clean and Healthy Life Behaviour among Street Children in Surabaya.Copyright © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

N2  - Child maltreatment is a complex and multifaceted construct in need of advanced statistical techniques to improve its measurement. The current study compared the predictive utility of a cumulative index to a factor analytic approach for constructing a measure of maltreatment. Data were from Waves III and IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Wave III: n = 14,800; Wave IV: n = 12,288). As adults, participants retrospectively reported on their childhood experiences of physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, supervisory neglect, and social services investigations. Both the cumulative index and a two-factor solution showed evidence of convergent validity, predicting lifetime incidence of homelessness, being paid for sex, and various measures of running away or living apart from biological parents, and prospectively predicting depression, substance use, and criminal behavior. The latent variables, derived from a factor analytic approach, had greater explanatory power for many outcomes compared to the cumulative index, even when controlling for sociodemographic variables. Results suggest that factor analysis is a better methodology than a cumulative index for measuring maltreatment in large datasets when explanatory power for external outcomes is of greatest concern.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - In adolescent and adult brains several molecular, electrophysiological, and ultrastructural measures of synaptic strength are higher after wake than after sleep [1, 2]. These results support the proposal that a core function of sleep is to renormalize the increase in synaptic strength associated with ongoing learning during wake, to reestablish cellular homeostasis and avoid runaway potentiation, synaptic saturation, and memory interference [2, 3]. Before adolescence however, when the brain is still growing and many new synapses are forming, sleep is widely believed to promote synapse formation and growth. To assess the role of sleep on synapses early in life, we studied 2-week-old mouse pups (both sexes) whose brain is still undergoing significant developmental changes, but in which sleep and wake are easy to recognize. In two strains (CD-1, YFP-H) we found that pups spend ~50% of the day asleep and show an immediate increase in total sleep duration after a few hours of enforced wake, indicative of sleep homeostasis. In YFP-H pups we then used serial block-face electron microscopy to examine whether the axon-spine interface (ASI), an ultrastructural marker of synaptic strength, changes between wake and sleep. We found that the ASI of cortical synapses (layer 2, motor cortex) was on average 33.9% smaller after sleep relative to after extended wake and the differences between conditions were consistent with multiplicative scaling. Thus, the need for sleep-dependent synaptic renormalization may apply also to the young, pre-weaned cerebral cortex, at least in the superficial layers of the primary motor area.Copyright © 2019 Sleep Research Society.

T1  - Measuring the impact of an interdisciplinary learning project on nursing, architecture and landscape design students' empathy

N2  - Domestic violence and refuge services in Australia In Australia and internationally, domestic violence is a major cause of homelessness for women and children and yet provision for accommodation for this user-group is not well documented or understood. When designing emergency accommodation, the concerns, preferences, and perspectives of individuals who access refuge services must be sought in order to create spaces that are conducive to the needs of this diverse and vulnerable group. An empathic 'lens' can provide meaningful insights that can inform the design of refuge services specifically targeted at addressing these needs. This paper describes an authentic interdisciplinary learning experience for nursing, architecture and landscape students at a university in Sydney, Australia, and presents the results of a study designed to measure the impact of this initiative on participants' empathy towards women and children who access refuge services as a result of homelessness and/or domestic violence. Empathy levels were measured using the Comprehensive State Empathy Scale, a validated measurement tool. An authentic interdisciplinary learning experience The learning experience consisted of collaborative meetings with stakeholders from the refuge sector, fieldwork, individual research, exchanging ideas and problem-solving in teams. Students then developed design guides for refuges that demonstrated their emerging understanding of the specific needs and perspectives of the issues faced by women and children who had experienced violence and found themselves homeless. Pre-post Comprehensive State Empathy Scale results indicated that the empathy levels of nursing and landscape students increased and those of architecture students decreased, however, these results were not statistically significant. Building empathy in teaching and learning The significance of the results from this study include an ability to compare the changes in empathy in students working collaboratively on a project and to ascertain possible reasons for this using a validated measurement tool. As empathy is one of the strongest negative correlates of prejudice, authentic teaching and learning activities, such as the one described in this paper, have the potential to positively impact the lived experience of women and children leaving situations of domestic violence.Copyright © 2019 Donnelly et al.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - This study considers risk associated with family homelessness for school functioning and experimental evidence on the effects of different housing interventions over time. Students in homeless families (N = 172; Mage = 7.31; SD = 4.15) were randomized to housing interventions that focus on acute risks (community-based rapid rehousing), chronic risks (permanent subsidy), or usual care (UC). A matched group of low-income, housed students served as an additional reference for effects on attendance, school mobility, and reading and math achievement across 4 years. Findings partially support the chronic-risk hypothesis that family homelessness interferes with achievement through its relation to deep poverty. Children randomly assigned to UC perform as well or better than children assigned to housing interventions in this municipality.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The CTN-0067 CHOICES trial tests implementation of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) versus treatment-as-usual (TAU) for opioid use disorders (OUD) in HIV clinics to improve HIV viral suppression. The study team investigated recruitment strategies to elucidate the barriers and facilitators to recruitment and enrollment in the study. MAIN TEXT: Methods: Semi-structured, in-depth, digitally recorded interviews were completed with study recruitment-related staff and medical providers (n =26) from six participating HIV clinics in the fall of 2018. Interviews probed 1) factors that might prevent prospective participants from engaging in study recruitment and enrollment procedures and 2) strategies used by study staff that encourage eligible patient participation. Interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed using a content analysis approach. RESULT(S): All respondents reported that barriers to recruitment and enrollment included challenging patient social and structural factors (e.g., homelessness or living environments with high substance use, criminal justice involvement), difficulty locating patients with unsuppressed HIV viral load and OUD within the HIV clinic, time-consuming study enrollment processes, and stigma around HIV and OUD which inhibited treatment seeking. Some respondents observed that distrust of research and researchers impeded recruitment activities in the community. A specific medication-related barrier was patient fear of opioid abstinence required prior to XR-NTX induction. Facilitators of recruitment included use of trusted peer outreach/recruitment workers in the community, hospitalizations that offered windows of opportunities for screening and XR-NTX induction, providing participant transportation, and partnerships with harm reduction organizations for referrals. CONCLUSION(S): Though study personnel encountered barriers to recruitment in the CHOICES study, persons with untreated HIV and OUD can be enrolled in multisite clinical trials by using enhanced recruitment strategies that extend outside of the HIV clinic. Employing peer outreach workers and collaborating with syringe service programs may be especially helpful in facilitating recruitment and merit inclusion in similar study protocols.

N2  - Homelessness is a national epidemic and individuals experiencing homelessness have decreased access to healthcare services. At the same time, physical therapy (PT) educational programs are required to teach students about cultural competence, pro-bono service, and advocacy for underserved populations. Having PT students provide pro-bono services to this population in a supervised environment is a mutually beneficial scenario for the patients, students, and the PT program. AIMS: The study objective was to evaluate whether participating in a student-run free clinic (SRFC) at a homeless shelter could change PT students' attitudes towards individuals experiencing homelessness. METHOD(S): Forty DPT students completed the Health Professionals' Attitude Toward the Homeless Inventory (HPATHI) with 19 volunteering (experimental group) to participate in the SRFC. The HPATHI was administered again immediately following participation in the SRFC to assess if their attitudes had changed. RESULT(S): Baseline scores differed between the control and experimental group (p=0.03). However, post-scores of the experimental group did not differ compared to pre-scores. The subsequent analysis estimated differences on 4 of 19 questions, specifically within the personal advocacy and social advocacy subscales. CONCLUSION(S): Overall, PT students' attitudes did not change significantly after one session of volunteering at an SRFC in a homeless shelter. However, small changes were seen in personal and social advocacy subscales of the HPATHI.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Youth often experience unique pathways into homelessness, such as family conflict, child abuse and neglect. Most research has focused on adult homeless populations, yet youth have specific needs that require adapted interventions. This review aims to synthesize evidence on interventions for youth and assess their impacts on health, social, and equity outcomes. METHOD(S): We systematically searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and other databases from inception until February 9, 2018 for systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials on youth interventions conducted in high income countries. We screened title and abstract and full text for inclusion, and data extraction were completed in duplicate, following the PRISMA-E (equity) review approach. RESULT(S): Our search identified 11,936 records. Four systematic reviews and 18 articles on randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Many studies reported on interventions including individual and family therapies, skill-building, case management, and structural interventions. Cognitive behavioural therapy led to improvements in depression and substance use, and studies of three family-based therapies reported decreases in substance use. Housing first, a structural intervention, led to improvements in housing stability. Many interventions showed inconsistent results compared to services as usual or other interventions, but often led to improvements over time in both the intervention and comparison group. The equity analysis showed that equity variables were inconsistently measured, but there was data to suggest differential outcomes based upon gender and ethnicity. CONCLUSION(S): This review identified a variety of interventions for youth experiencing homelessness. Promising interventions include cognitive behavioural therapy for addressing depression, family-based therapy for substance use outcomes, and housing programs for housing stability. Youth pathways are often unique and thus prevention and treatment may benefit from a tailored and flexible approach.

N2  - Background: Self-inflicted burns are a regular source of admissions to burns unit's worldwide. However, there is limited evidence regarding risk factors that associated with self-inflicted burn. Aim(s): To determine factors that associated with self-inflicted burn (SIB) among women in reproductive age in Baghdad, Iraq. Method(s): Sex, age and time matched case-control study was conducted among females with the age range 15 to 45 years in Baghdad, Iraq. Each case was individual matched to two controls in the similar age (+/- 1), sex and time when SIB happened. Controls were selected from the same hospital where the cases have been admitted in the same period. Data was collected on the variables age, occupation, education, marital status, socioeconomic status (SES), etc. Crude and adjusted odds Ratio (OR) were estimated by simple and multiple conditional logistic regression model. Result(s): We found a positive association between poor SES (AOR = 3.61; 95% CI (2.04 to 6.11)), family history of SIB (AOR = 1.6; 95% CI (1.14 to 4.18)), homelessness (AOR = 3.9; 95% CI (2.07 to 5.48)), subjected to physical (AOR = 2.0; 95% CI (1.35 to 2.95)) and sexual violence (AOR = 1.1; 95% CI (1.17 to 4.51)), having the history of health problem (AOR = 2.63; 95% CI (1.55 to 6.14)), feeling discrimination (AOR = 3.11; 95% CI (1.10 to 5.03)) and dissatisfaction with unstable living condition (AOR = 3.12; 95% CI (1.90 to 6.41)) with SIB. Conclusion(s): Several and interlinked socioeconomic and behavioral factors were associated with SIB in women. Implementing multifaceted intervention is vital to prevent SIB among women with poor SES, living in temporary accommodation, and subjected to domestic violence.Copyright © 2019, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

N2  - Background Gay, bisexual, and transgender youth and homeless youth are at high risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, little recent data exist describing STI positivity by anatomical site among those groups. We determined the positivity of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infection, and syphilis antibody reactivity among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and homeless youth. Methods We recruited 1,264 adolescents with high risk behavior aged 12 to 24 years from homeless shelters, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender organizations, community health centers, and using social media and online dating apps in Los Angeles, California and New Orleans, Louisiana from May 2017 to February 2019. Participants received point-of-care pharyngeal, rectal, and urethral/vaginal CT and NG testing and syphilis antibody testing. We calculated STI positivity by anatomical site and compared positivity by participant subgroups based on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, sex assigned at birth, and gender identity. Results CT and NG positivity and syphilis antibody reactivity was higher among HIV-infected adolescent men who have sex with men (MSM) than HIV-uninfected adolescent MSM (40.2% vs. 19%, P < 0.05), particularly CT or NG rectal infection (28% vs. 12.3%, P < 0.05). Of participants with positive CT or NG infections, 65% had extragenital-only infections, 20% had both extragenital and urogenital infections, and 15% had urogenital-only infections. Conclusions Sexually transmitted infection positivity was high, particularly among transgender women and MSM. The high proportion of rectal and pharyngeal infections highlights the importance of both urogenital and extragenital STI screening. More accessible STI testing is necessary for high-risk adolescent populations.Copyright © 2019 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - BACKGROUND: School-delivered nutrition assistance programs have improved dietary intake for children from food-insecure households during the school year. However, little is known about their diet quality and eating patterns during summer months. OBJECTIVE(S): School-aged children's summer month weekday and weekend day diet quality and eating patterns were assessed by household food insecurity. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of cross-sectional data was employed. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: During the summers of 2011 through 2017, baseline data were collected from parent-child dyads participating in one of two community-based obesity prevention trials in metropolitan Minnesota (N=218). The mean age of children was 10 years; 50% were girls, 49% were nonwhite, and 25% were from food-insecure households. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Children from food-secure and food-insecure households were identified by using the short form of the US Household Food Security Survey. Healthy Eating Index 2015 and eating patterns-including energy intake and consumption of whole fruits, vegetables, 100% fruit/vegetable juice, and sugar-sweetened beverages-were estimated by means of 24-hour dietary recall interviews conducted on weekdays and weekend days. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: General linear modeling was used to examine diet quality and eating patterns by food insecurity, controlling for child age, child body mass index z score, and parent education. RESULT(S): Children from food-insecure and food-secure households had Healthy Eating Index 2015 scores less than 50. Children from food-insecure households reported less energy intake, fewer cups of whole fruit, and more sugar-sweetened beverage consumption for every 1,000 kcal consumed on a weekend day when compared with their counterparts from food-secure households (P<0.05). Similar results were not seen for weekday eating patterns. CONCLUSION(S): Whole fruit and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption varied by food insecurity on weekend days during summer months. Because children tend to gain weight during summer months, efforts to increase weekend access to whole fruits and promote water consumption may contribute to weight gain prevention and healthy development, especially for children from food-insecure households.Copyright © 2019 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

N2  - Background: Improving infant and young child feeding practices is critical to improved nutrition, health, and development of children. Ethiopia adopted the WHO recommendations of child feeding practices and developed the national guideline. In spite of this fact, only few children start and received appropriate complementary feeding based on the recommendation. Therefore, the study aimed to determine dietary diversity score and its associated factors among under five children at Dabat Health and Demographic Surveillance System site (HDSS), northwest Ethiopia. Method(s): A cross-sectional community based study was carried out from February to June 2016. All children aged 6-59 months old who lived in HDSS site were included in the survey. Odds ratio (OR) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated to show the strength of association. Finally, variables with a P-value of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Result(s): In this study, a total of 3433 children were included. About 34.87% (95%CI: 33.27, 36.49%) of the children received adequately diversified diet. The odds of receiving adequately diversified diet was higher among children whose mother had secondary and above education (AOR = 6.51; 95%CI: 4.95, 8.56), had antenatal care (AOR = 1.90; 95%CI: 1.60, 2.26) and postnatal care visits (AOR = 1.31; 95%CI: 1.00, 1, 72), and children who feed with their family (AOR = 1.39; 95%CI: 1.17, 1.65). However, a lower dietary diversity score was observed among younger children; 6-11 months old (AOR = 0.59; 95%CI: 0.41, 0.85), and children from food insecure household (AOR = 0.76; 95%CI: 0.63, 0.92). Conclusion(s): Diversified diet feeding practice is low in Dabat HDSS site. Age of the child, maternal education, antenatal and postnatal care visits, and household food insecurity were significantly associated with dietary diversity of children. Hence, ensuring household food security and enhancing the coverage of maternal health care utilization are recommended to increase dietary diversity of children.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Homelessness is rising in the United Kingdom, despite investment in measures to eradicate it made by the government and charity organisations. Aim(s): The aim is to examine the stories of homeless people in order to document their perceptions of their social status, the reasons that led to their homelessness, and propose a conceptual explanation. Method(s): We conducted 26 semi-structured interviews in three centres for homeless people in Cheshire, North West of England. Result(s): Three categories-education, employment, and health-emerged from the data and provided a theoretical explanation for the reasons that led to their homelessness. These are vital not only for the successful negotiation of one's way out of homelessness, but also for achieving other social goods, including social connections, social mobility, and engaging in positive social relationships. Conclusion(s): Participants catalogued the adverse childhood experiences, which they believe limited their capacity to meaningfully engage with the social institution for social goods, such as education, social services, and institutions of employment. Since not all people who have misfortunes of poor education, poor health, and loss of job end up being homeless, we contend that a combination of these with multiple adverse childhood experiences may have weakened their resilience to traumatic life changes, such as loss of job and poor health.Copyright © 2019 by the authors.

N2  - For 25 years, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Community Access to Child Health (CATCH) program has supported pediatricians in collaborating within their communities to advance the health of all children. CATCH grants support pediatric residents and pediatricians in planning or implementing community-based child health initiatives. The CATCH program has provided almost 10 million dollars through 842 planning, 585 resident, and 305 implementation grants to .1700 pediatricians. Urban, rural, suburban, and tribal communities in every state as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have benefited from CATCH-funded projects. Collaborations with community partners such as schools, homeless shelters, and mental health centers have led to programs serving children and families, especially those living in poverty and in minority groups. The most recent program data reveal that 87.5% of the projects are operating 2 years after funding. Many CATCH projects have not only sustained themselves but have grown into larger programs with funding from other sources. CATCH has influenced pediatricians' careers by providing important skills, networking opportunities, career legitimacy, mentoring opportunities, and increased engagement with the AAP. More than 350 pediatricians have served the AAP as CATCH facilitators, the network of physicians that provides technical assistance to applicants and reviews grant applications. Responding to changing trends, CATCH leaders have looked at other funding models and recently launched the CATCH-On initiative. CATCH-On creates and provides templates from successful CATCH projects to busy pediatricians who can then implement the project in their communities with minimal funding.Copyright © 2019 by the American Academy of Pediatrics

N2  - The objectives of this cross-sectional study were to: (i) determine whether there are differences in self-esteem and self-efficacy for healthy lifestyle choices between children living in food secure and food insecure households; and (ii) determine whether the association between household food insecurity (HFI), self-esteem and self-efficacy differs by gender. Survey responses of 5281 fifth-grade students (10 and 11 years of age) participating in the Canadian Children's Lifestyle and School Performance Study II were analyzed using logistic and linear regression. HFI status was determined by the six-item short-form Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM). Students from food insecure households had significantly higher odds of low self-esteem, and significantly lower scores for global self-efficacy to make healthy choices, compared to students from food secure households. These associations were stronger for girls than for boys and appeared independent of parental educational attainment. Household income appeared to be the essential underlying determinant of the associations of food insecurity with self-esteem and self-efficacy. Upstream social policies such as improving the household income of low-income residents will reduce food insecurity and potentially improve self-esteem and self-efficacy for healthy choices among children. This may improve health and learning, and in the long term, job opportunities and household earnings.Copyright © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Background: Young people have unique social, emotional and developmental needs that require a welcoming and responsive health system, and policies that support their access to health care. Those who are socially or culturally marginalised may face additional challenges in navigating health care, contributing to health inequity. The aim of this study was to understand health system navigation, including the role of technology, for young people belonging to one or more marginalised groups, in order to inform youth health policy in New South Wales, Australia. Method(s): This qualitative longitudinal study involved 2-4 interviews each over 6 to 12 months with marginalised young people aged 12-24 years living in NSW. The analysis used Nvivo software and grounded theory. Result(s): We interviewed 41 young people at baseline who were living in rural or remote areas, sexuality and/or gender diverse, refugee, homeless, and/or Aboriginal. A retention rate of over 85% was achieved. Nineteen belonged to more than one marginalised group allowing an exploration of intersectionality. General practitioners (family physicians) were the most commonly accessed service throughout the study period. Participants were ambivalent about their healthcare journeys. Qualitative analysis identified five themes: 1. Technology brings opportunities to understand, connect and engage with services 2. Healthcare journeys are shaped by decisions weighing up convenience, engagement, effectiveness and affordability. 3. Marginalised young people perceive and experience multiple forms of discrimination leading to forgone care. 4. Multiple marginalisation makes health system navigation more challenging 5. The impact of health system complexity and fragmentation may be mitigated by system knowledge and navigation support Conclusion(s): The compounding effects of multiple discrimination and access barriers were experienced more strongly for young people belonging to mutiple marginalised groups. We identify several areas for improving clinical practice and policy. Integrating technology and social media into processes that facilitate access and navigation, providing respectful and welcoming services that recognise diversity, improving health literacy and involving professionals in advocacy and navigation support may help to address these issues.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - Human trafficking is a significant and growing public health concern. Subgroups of adolescents and young adults are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking, especially youth who are unstably housed or homeless. While youth experiencing trafficking come into contact with the healthcare system, they are often not identified during routine assessment due to lack of specific inquiry and low disclosure. Therefore, we utilized a mixed-methods study design to assess the differences in the identification of human trafficking among youth experiencing homelessness (n = 129) between a standard psychosocial assessment tool and a human trafficking specific assessment tool. Findings indicate that the tool developed to specifically assess for human trafficking was more likely to identify youth experiencing sexual and labor exploitation, as well as the risk factors for human trafficking. Secondly, youth reported that mistrust of the system, fear of involving the police if reported, not wanting to interact with the mental healthcare system, and stigma are barriers to disclosing human trafficking. In conclusion, healthcare providers caring for youth experiencing homelessness should adopt improved screening tools for human trafficking to reduce the risk of missed opportunities for prevention and treatment among this high-risk population of youth.Copyright © 2019 by the authors.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of an integrated care model on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of formerly chronically homeless individuals in permanent supportive housing. METHOD(S): From 2014 to 2017, eligible individuals in Houston, Texas (n=323), were placed in 1 of 2 permanent supportive housing service delivery models. Both models included coordinated care teams. In the intervention group, teams had a single plan of care with the partnering clinic. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and 36-item Short Form Survey were administered at baseline and every 6 months for 30 months. We assessed intervention group emergency department use at 2 years. We evaluated change by using hierarchical linear growth models. RESULT(S): There was a significant and clinically meaningful increase in HRQOL in the intervention group, with the intervention group reporting improvement over the comparison group. Intervention group emergency department use decreased by 70% (no comparison group). CONCLUSION(S): Those in the intervention group with a single, coordinated plan of care reported significant and clinically meaningful increases in their HRQOL. Public Health Implications. Coordinated care models have potential to reduce societal costs and increase HRQOL, providing a financial and humanitarian justification for the continued investment in collaborative care in permanent supportive housing.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There is scarce evidence on prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among individuals who are homeless and diagnosed with severe mental illness. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of HCV infection and associated risk factors in a representative sample of adults from At Home study. METHOD(S): The Vancouver At Home study is part of the At Home/Chez Soi (AH/CS) project-a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of a Housing First intervention among homeless persons with mental illness in five Canadian cities between 2009 and 2013 with a 2-year follow-up period. RESULT(S): Of 497 participants, 28% reported positive HCV serostatus. Educational level equal or less than eighth grade (AOR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 4.8), history of incarceration (AOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.5), substance dependence (AOR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.1, 3.7) and injection drug use during one month prior to the recruitment (AOR: 7.8, 95% CI: 4.0, 15.0) were associated with an increased risk of HCV infection. Having a psychotic disorder (AOR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.3, 1.0) and age < 25 (AOR: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.0, 0.7) were associated with a lower risk. Blood tests performed on 30 participants agreed with self-report in 97% of cases [Kappa = 0.9 (95% CI: 0.6, 1.3), PABAK = 0.9]. CONCLUSION(S): The high prevalence of HCV among individuals who were homeless with mental illness underlies the importance of prevention and treatment of HCV in this population, especially those with concurrent substance use disorders. Self-report seems to be a valid tool for evaluation of the HCV status in this population.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Introduction: Identifying distinct patterns of tobacco product use can inform efforts to reduce poly-tobacco use among young people, but little is known regarding patterns of use among youth experiencing homelessness. This study identified patterns of using tobacco/nicotine products among youth experiencing homelessness, and assessed whether certain subgroups of youth were more likely than others to engage in specific patterns of use. Method(s): Data were collected from a probability sample of 469 homeless youth who used tobacco in the past month, recruited from 25 service and street sites in Los Angeles County. Participants reported on lifetime and past month use of natural cigarettes, cigars, little cigars/cigarillos, electronic nicotine delivery systems, hookah, and chewing tobacco. Latent class analysis was used to identify patterns of tobacco product use. Result(s): We identified four main classes of use: traditional cigarettes smokers (34.7% of the sample), poly-tobacco experimenters (24.9%), current users of combustible products (natural cigarettes, cigars, little cigars/cigarillos; 27.1%), and current poly-tobacco users (13.1%). Youth who were male, slept outdoors, and screened positive for substance abuse disorder were more than twice as likely as their counterparts to be current poly-tobacco users relative to traditional cigarettes smokers. Conclusion(s): Rates of poly-tobacco experimentation and current use among youth experiencing homelessness are high. This suggests that efforts to reduce the use of tobacco products in this population should focus on the combined use of these products, and further, that users with the greatest poly-use may have competing unmet needs such as substance use disorders and more severe homelessness.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Background: Economic vulnerability, such as homelessness and unemployment, contributes to the HIV risk among racial minorities in the U.S., who are disproportionately infected. Yet, few economic-strengthening interventions have been adapted for HIV prevention in economically-vulnerable African-American young adults. Engaging Microenterprise for Resource Generation and Health Empowerment (EMERGE) is a feasibility randomized clinical trial of an HIV prevention microenterprise intervention with integrated text messages ("nudges") that are informed by behavioral economic principles. The trial aims to reduce sexual risk behaviors and increase employment and uptake of HIV preventive behaviors. Methods/design: In total, 40 young adults who are African-American, aged 18-24, live in Baltimore City, have experienced at least one episode of homelessness in the last 12 months, are unemployed or underemployed (fewer than 10 h per week), are not enrolled in school, own a cell phone with text messaging, and report at least one episode of unprotected or unsafe sex in the prior 12 months will be recruited from two community-based organizations providing residential supportive services to urban youth. Participants will undergo a 3-week run-in period and thereafter be randomly assigned to one of two groups with active interventions for 20 weeks. The first group ("comparison") will receive text messages with information on job openings. The second group ("experimental") will receive text messages with information on job openings plus information on HIV prevention and business educational sessions, a mentored apprenticeship, and a start-up grant, and business and HIV prevention text messages based on principles from behavioral economics. The two primary outcomes relate to the feasibility of conducting a larger trial. Secondary outcomes relate to employment, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV preventive practices. All participants will be assessed using an in-person questionnaire at pre-intervention (prior to randomization) and at 3 weeks post-intervention. To obtain repeated, longitudinal measures, participants will be assessed weekly using text message surveys from pre-intervention up to 3 weeks post-intervention. Discussion(s): This study will be one of the first U.S.-based feasibility randomized clinical trials of an HIV prevention microenterprise intervention for economically-vulnerable African-American young adults. The findings will inform whether and how to conduct a larger efficacy trial for HIV risk reduction in this population. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03766165.

N2  - Introduction: Most young people experiencing homelessness smoke cigarettes, but little is known about use of alternative tobacco products (ATPs) such as e-cigarettes or other electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and little cigars/cigarillos (LCCs). This study examines past month use and correlates of cigarettes and ATP among young tobacco users experiencing homelessness. Method(s): We surveyed a probability sample of N = 469 unaccompanied homeless 13-25 year olds (mean age = 22; 71% male), who reported past month use of any type of tobacco product, from 25 service and street sites in Los Angeles County. Result(s): Nearly all (90%) participants reported smoking regular cigarettes, and 78% reported using at least one tobacco product other than regular cigarettes. The most commonly used of these other products was natural cigarettes (55%), followed by LCCs (43%), ENDS (34%), cigars (31%), hookah (14%), chewing tobacco (7%), and snus (5%). Multivariable models indicated that correlates of past month use differed by product, but included sociodemographic characteristics, homelessness severity, depression, exposure to other people who used the product, and product perceptions (e.g., relative access, cost, and harm compared to cigarettes). Conclusion(s): Use of cigarettes and ATPs are both widespread among young homeless tobacco users, suggesting that efforts to reduce tobacco use in this population should have a broad focus that includes a variety of products. The effectiveness of these efforts may be enhanced by addressing their considerable exposure to other tobacco users, as well as their perceptions of certain products as being less harmful or more cost-effective options than regular cigarettes.Copyright © 2019

N2  - Background: Adversity may negatively impact young children's sleep but receiving home visitation services could buffer children from this potential consequence of adversity. Objective(s): This study examined whether young children's adverse experiences increased their risk for sleep problems and if Promoting First Relationships (PFR), a home visitation program, reduced children's risk for sleep problems both directly and indirectly through increased parenting sensitivity. Participants and setting: Participants were 247 parents and their 10- to 24-month-old child recruited from Child Protective Services offices. Method(s): A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing PFR to a resource and referral control condition was conducted. Four time points of data were collected from baseline to 6 months post-intervention. Parenting sensitivity was measured at all time points using a parent-child interaction tool. Children's adversities were measured at various time points using caregiver report tools and official state records. Children's sleep problems were reported by parents at 6 months post-intervention. Result(s): The likelihood of having a sleep problem increased as children's adversities increased (beta =.23, SE =.08, p =.005). There was no effect (direct or indirect) of treatment assignment on children's sleep problems (ps >.05). Post hoc analyses showed a treatment assignment by adversity interaction such that children's odds of having a sleep problem increased as their adversities increased, but only among children in the control condition (b = -0.37, SE = 0.17, p =.030). Conclusion(s): Experiencing more adversities associated with a greater risk for sleep problems, but PFR buffered children from this risk.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Objective: Food insecurity is associated with childhood obesity possibly mediated through caregiver feeding practices and beliefs. We examined if caregiver feeding practices differed by household food security status in a diverse sample of infants. We hypothesized that feeding practices differ based on food security status. Patients and Methods: Included in the baseline cross-sectional analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial to prevent obesity were 842 caregivers of 2-month-old infants presenting for well-child care at 4 academic institutions. Food insecurity exposure was based on an affirmative answer to 1 of 2 items in a 2-item validated questionnaire. Chi-square tests examined the association between parent feeding practices and food security status. Logistic regression adjusted for covariates. Differences in caregiver feeding practices by food security status and race/ethnicity were explored with an interaction term (food security status x race/ethnicity). Result(s): Forty-three percent of families screened as food insecure. In adjusted logistic regression, parents from food-insecure households were more likely to endorse that "the best way to make an infant stop crying is to feed him or her" (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-2.29) and "when my baby cries, I immediately feed him or her" (aOR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.06-1.83). Food-insecure caregivers less frequently endorsed paying attention to their baby when he or she is full or hungry (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34-0.96). Racial/ethnic differences in beliefs and behaviors were observed by food security status. Conclusion(s): During early infancy, feeding practices differed among caregivers by household food security status. Further research is needed to examine whether these practices are associated with increased risk of obesity and obesity-related morbidity.Copyright © 2018

N2  - Study Objective: To compare clinician perspectives for the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) with those of adolescent patients and parents. Design(s): Cross-sectional study. Setting(s): Urban academic pediatric and adolescent medicine practices and school-based health clinics in a large urban community with a high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections and a national sample of adolescent-serving clinicians. Participant(s): Female patients aged 12-19 years, parents raising an adolescent older than the age of 12 years in the urban community, and clinicians who serve adolescents recruited from regional and national listservs. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Visual analogue scale scores on a scale of 0-10 corresponding to preferences on patient disposition in 17 clinical scenarios for a hypothetical patient with PID. Result(s): Compared with adolescents, clinicians were significantly more likely to endorse hospitalizations when patients presented with severe or complicated illness (beta = 0.9; standard error [SE], 0.22; P <.001), possible surgical emergency (beta = 0.83; SE, 0.2; P <.001), concurrent pregnancy (beta = 0.59; SE, 0.3; P =.046), or failure of outpatient treatment (beta = 0.58; SE, 0.29; P =.045). Compared with clinicians, adolescents were significantly more likely to endorse hospitalizations when patients presented at a young age (beta = 1.36; SE, 0.38; P <.001), were homeless (beta = 0.88; SE, 0.32; P =.007), were afraid to inform a partner (beta = 1.66; SE, 0.40; P <.001), or had unaware parents (beta = 2.86; SE, 0.39; P <.001). Conclusion(s): Clinicians were more likely to recommend hospitalization when doing so adhered to national guidelines on PID treatment. Adolescents opted for hospitalization more often than clinicians in scenarios in which patients exhibited social vulnerability. Clinicians should engage with adolescents in shared disposition planning and use a more nuanced approach to PID management for adolescents who might not be able to tolerate an outpatient regimen.Copyright © 2019 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology

N2  - Sexual behaviour is highly motivated and female rats begin to express it during adolescence. The circuitries implicated in the control of motivated behaviours continue to mature during adolescence and seem more sensitive to the effects of psychostimulants such as cocaine. However, a putative differential effect of this drug on the sexual behaviour of females according to age has not yet been studied. Therefore, we compared the motivational value of a male and the expression of sexual behaviour of late-adolescent and adult female rats after chronic treatment with a vehicle or 15.0 mg/kg cocaine. The strong incentive value of a male rat, in a male versus female preference test, for adolescent and adult female rats, was not affected by cocaine. During sexual interaction, adolescents were as sexually receptive as were adults; however, they expressed more runaways and social investigation. Cocaine treatment did not modify the expression of sexual behaviour in either group, but increased social investigation in adolescent rats. These results indicate that late-adolescent pro-oestrus females are highly sexually motivated and might express behaviours typical of this life period during sexual interaction. Moreover, although chronic cocaine treatment seemed to affect more adolescents, it did not alter the sexual motivation or behaviour of females.Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Running away from home is a known risk factor for commercial sexual exploitation among youth; however, research has not fully investigated the process by which multiple factors at individual, familial, and extra-familial levels increase youths' risk for runaway behavior. This study applies an ecological risk factor framework to assess risk for runaway behavior among individuals exposed to commercial sexual exploitation and examines mediating relationships between salient risk factors (i.e. substance abuse, insufficient basic needs, having a much older boyfriend/girlfriend) and runaway behavior. A cross-sectional, retrospective survey was administered to individuals involved in the commercial sex industry using Respondent Driven Sampling methods (N = 273). Bivariate results suggested associations between runaway behavior and childhood emotional and physical abuse, having friends who sold sex, having a much older boyfriend/girlfriend, dropping out of school, being worried about where to eat/sleep, homelessness, and frequent alcohol and drug use prior to entering the commercial sex industry. Hierarchical logistic regression revealed that individuals with runaway behavior histories were more likely to have frequently used alcohol and/or drugs and to have insufficient basic needs compared to those did not run away; however, these factors were no longer significant after accounting for having a much older boyfriend/girlfriend. Having an older boyfriend/girlfriend fully mediated the relationship between frequent alcohol and/or drug use and runaway behavior. Findings support the need for community and school-based prevention programs that target these risk factors with a specific focus on healthy dating relationships, which may reduce risk for runaway behavior and subsequent commercial sexual exploitation.Copyright © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - SETTING: The household and non-household contacts of patients with tuberculosis (TB) face varying degrees of risk of infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. OBJECTIVE : To quantify new infection and to determine the risk factors associated with new infection among named contacts in San Francisco, CA, USA. DESIGN: We performed a cohort study in patients with culture-positive pulmonary TB. We analyzed patient, contact, environmental and bacterial characteristics. RESULTS : Of the 2422 contacts named by 256 patients, 149 (6.2%) had new infection due to recent transmission from 79 (30.9%) patients. Of the 149 new infections, 87 (58.4%) occurred among household contacts and 62 (41.6%) among non-household contacts. Numerous acid-fast bacilli in sputum (odds ratio [OR] 2.64, 95%CI 1.32-5.25) and contacts being named by more than one patient (OR 2.90, 95%CI 1.23-6.85) were associated with new infection among household contacts. Being older than 50 years (OR 1.93, 95%CI 1.09- 3.41) and an Asian/Pacific Islander (OR 3.09, 95%CI 1.50-6.37) were associated with new infection among non-household contacts. CONC L U S IONS : Fewer than one third of patients caused new infection to his/her contacts. A substantial proportion of transmission resulting in new infection occurred outside of the household. The risk factors for infection among household and non-household contacts are different and should be considered when prioritizing control interventions.Copyright © 2019 The Union.

N2  - Purpose: To assess the radiologic findings associated with intimate partner violence (IPV). Material(s) and Method(s): Electronic medical records of 185 patients referred to the IPV support program from the emergency department (ED) between January 2015 and October 2016 were retrospectively reviewed and compared with an age- and sex-matched control group of 555 subjects (1:3 ratio of IPV victims to control subjects) who presented to the ED. Reports of all imaging studies performed within 5 years prior to the index ED visit were reviewed. Result(s): The majority of patients who experienced IPV (mean age, 34.2 years 6 12.2 [standard deviation]) were female (178 of 185 [96.2%]) and were largely African American (69 of 185 [37.3%]). Demographic and clinical variables independently associated with IPV were race (odds ratio [OR] range, 3.2-5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8, 12.7), psychiatric comorbidities (OR, 5.4; 95% CI: 3.4, 8.8), and homelessness (OR, 13.0; 95% CI: 5.4, 31.2). IPV victims underwent more imaging studies in the preceding 5 years (median, four studies) than did control subjects (median, one study). Obstetric-gynecologic findings (OR, 4.4; 95% CI: 2.1, 9.6) and acute fractures (OR, 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.3) seen on images were independently associated with IPV. The addition of imaging findings to demographic and clinical variables increased the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the multivariate model to detect IPV (0.87 vs 0.86, P , .01), and the cross-validated multivariate model had an AUC of 0.85. Acute fractures involved the face or skull (range, P , .01 to P = .05), and chronic fractures affected the extremities and nasal bone (P , .01 and P = .05, respectively) more frequently in the IPV group than in the control group. Conclusion(s): Intimate partner violence victims undergo more imaging studies and have a higher frequency of potential violence-related imaging findings when compared with age- and sex-matched control subjects.Copyright © RSNA, 2019.

N2  - Objectives To compare health-related quality of life and prevalence of chronic diseases in housed and homeless populations. Design Cross-sectional survey with an age-matched and sex-matched housed comparison group. Setting Hostels, day centres and soup runs in London and Birmingham, England. Participants Homeless participants were either sleeping rough or living in hostels and had a history of sleeping rough. The comparison group was drawn from the Health Survey for England. The study included 1336 homeless and 13 360 housed participants. Outcome measures Chronic diseases were self-reported asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), epilepsy, heart problems, stroke and diabetes. Health-related quality of life was measured using EQ-5D-3L. Results Housed participants in more deprived neighbourhoods were more likely to report disease. Homeless participants were substantially more likely than housed participants in the most deprived quintile to report all diseases except diabetes (which had similar prevalence in homeless participants and the most deprived housed group). For example, the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was 1.1% (95% CI 0.7% to 1.6%) in the least deprived housed quintile; 2.0% (95% CI 1.5% to 2.6%) in the most deprived housed quintile; and 14.0% (95% CI 12.2% to 16.0%) in the homeless group. Social gradients were also seen for problems in each EQ-5D-3L domain in the housed population, but homeless participants had similar likelihood of reporting problems as the most deprived housed group. The exception was problems related to anxiety, which were substantially more common in homeless people than any of the housed groups. Conclusions While differences in health between housed socioeconomic groups can be described as a slope', differences in health between housed and homeless people are better understood as a cliff'.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

N2  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious public health problem in many regions of the world, especially in the poorest areas. For this reason, screening for active and latent forms must be considered when dealing with high-risk groups such as irregular immigrants in Western countries. We conducted a retrospective cohort study by recruiting subjects aged >=15 years who underwent a tuberculin skin test at a dedicated National Health Service Centre in a northern Italian province between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013. These participants were followed up until 31 December 2016. We aimed at evaluating an experimental protocol for active and latent tuberculosis screening, focusing on patient compliance, feasibility, and capability to detect clinical forms of the disease. We enrolled 368 irregular immigrants, i.e., immigrants not having a valid residence permit and who were therefore not entitled to choose a general practitioner. In total, 90.22% of these completed all the steps for the screening of active TB, while 87.33% also undertook screening for the latent form of the disease. Homelessness, self-reported prostitution, female sex, and employment status adversely affected compliance. Chronic alcohol consumption was associated with increased risk of no beginning or interruption of the procedures. All of the five patients with active TB successfully completed the treatment. Overall, adherence to the screening program was high compared to other studies in immigrants, possibly owing to organizational factors such as the availability of cultural mediators, the network between the different health services, the presence of dedicated nursing staff and a free-of-charge service. In addition, selected vulnerable subgroups should be targeted using tailored screening and follow-up programs.Copyright © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Aim: Information is scarce about the issues faced by street working. This study examined traumatic events experienced by boys working on the streets of Iraq compared to schoolboys. Method(s): We compared 100 street working boys aged 8-16 years who were attending a drop-in centre for street working children in Duhok City, Kurdistan, Iraq, in 2004/2005 with 100 age-matched schoolboys randomly selected from six local schools. The instruments that were used included the Harvard-Uppsala Trauma Questionnaire for Children. Result(s): Most of the street working boys were involved in activities such as selling goods or shoe shining, and some were stealing or begging. None were involved in drugs or prostitution. The street working boys showed a significantly higher rate of traumatic events than the control group (96% versus 64%, p < 0.001) and higher rates of moderate to severe trauma levels (78% versus 25%, p < 0.001). A varying degree of association was found for reporting different traumatic events. The largest effect size was found for torture, with an odds ratio of 28.4, and the smallest for maltreatment or assault (2.7). Conclusion(s): Street working boys in Iraq faced a higher risk of exposure to traumatic events than age-matched schoolboys.Copyright ©2018 Foundation Acta Paediatrica.

N2  - Family factors, such as poor family functioning and trauma, have been associated with negative outcomes for homeless adolescents. Further study is needed to better understand how family factors and trauma jointly relate to mental health problems and externalizing behaviors among homeless adolescents. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the influence of trauma (encompassing traumatic events experienced prior to, and after, becoming homeless) and family factors (poor family functioning and family conflict) on mental health problems and externalizing behaviors (substance use, delinquent behaviors, and sexual risk) among 201 homeless adolescents, ages 12 to 17 years. Trauma, poor family functioning, and family conflict significantly predicted greater mental health problems, delinquent behaviors, high-risk sexual behaviors and substance use. Overall, the findings suggest that family factors appear to be key to understanding mental health problems and externalizing behaviors among homeless adolescents. Implications, limitations and future directions are addressed.Copyright © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

N2  - Background: Homeless youth are a population at risk for suicidal behavior. Despite growing knowledge about risk factors, protective factors against suicidal behavior among this population are still poorly understood. Aim(s): To explore differences in coping and social support between homeless adolescents who attempted suicide and those who did not. Method(s): In total, 76 homeless adolescents from eight different shelters provided information about their suicidal behaviors over the previous year and filled out coping and social support questionnaires. Result(s): Homeless adolescents who had not attempted suicide perceived more social support (tangible assistance and guidance). Conversely, youth who had attempted suicide reported using more nonproductive strategies of coping (tension reduction, keep to self, and self-blame). Tangible assistance and tension reduction were found to be the strongest predictors. Limitation(s): As most of these youth were not homeless for a long time, care should be taken in generalizing these results to adolescents with longer histories of homelessness. Conclusion(s): Productive coping does not seem to constitute a sufficient personal resource to protect homeless adolescents from suicide attempts. Nonproductive coping could, however, be considered a serious risk factor. Consequently, promoting homeless youths' ability to find environmental resources, especially tangible assistance, could be the most valuable approach.

N2  - Objective: To examine associations between housing instability and poor diet quality in a sample of urban parents and children. Method(s): Cross-sectional study of 340 parent/guardian-child dyads visiting a pediatric primary care center in Boston, Massachusetts. The parent/guardian (hereafter, parent) completed 2 Harvard Service Food Frequency Questionnaires, one regarding their own dietary intake and one regarding their child's intake, and an assessment of health-related social needs. Diet quality was measured using the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010; score range 0-100). Housing instability was defined as: 1) homeless or in sheltered housing, 2) doubled up with another family, 3) utilities threatened or shut off, or 4) concerned about eviction. Multivariable logistic regression was used to measure associations between unstable housing and lowest-quartile HEI-2010 scores, adjusting for parent age, race/ethnicity, education, income, and child age. Result(s): Median (interquartile range) parent and child HEI-2010 scores were 63.8 (56.3-70.8) and 59.0 (54.2-64.7), respectively. Housing instability was found in 136 dyads (40%). In multivariable analysis, it was associated with increased odds of lowest-quartile total parent HEI-2010 scores (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.1-3.5) but not child scores (aOR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.8-2.5). It also was associated with increased odds of lowest-quartile parent HEI-2010 dietary component scores for Total vegetables and Greens and beans (aOR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7 and aOR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3-4.8, respectively). Conclusion(s): In this urban primary care population, housing instability is associated with lower diet quality scores for parents but not children. Lower vegetable consumption appears to drive this association.Copyright © 2019 Academic Pediatric Association

T1  - Mastery Motivation and School Readiness Among Young Children Experiencing Homelessness
A1  - Ramakrishnan J.L.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Psychosocial risk exposure in childhood is associated with a greater probability of emotional, behavioral, and academic problems. It is not surprising that children who experience homelessness, a marker of high cumulative risk, show significant emotional and behavioral problems and lower academic achievement than other children, including impoverished children who are not homeless. Nonetheless, some children manifest positive adjustment despite the hazards associated with homelessness, and it is important to identify protective influences that might be targeted for intervention. One potential factor is mastery motivation (MM), or the drive to control and master challenges, theoretically associated with resilience and empirically linked to adaptive cognitive outcomes in low-risk children. Currently, there is little research on MM in high-risk young children overall, and data are particularly limited on the key question of whether MM is associated with better outcomes in domains crucial for school readiness, including socioemotional adjustment, self-regulation, and academic competence. This study examined observed MM in 85 young children ages 3 to 5 living with their parents in an emergency shelter. Children completed behavioral tasks to assess MM, and measures linked with school readiness were assessed directly or by parent report. Higher MM was associated with better social and emotional functioning and emotion regulation but not math achievement or executive functioning. Follow-up analyses indicated that MM was indirectly associated with prosocial behavior through better emotion-regulation abilities. Implications are discussed for further research and for interventions designed to address educational disparities and promote school success for children experiencing homelessness.Copyright © 2019 Global Alliance for Behavioral Health and Social Justice.

N2  - Social quality is the extent to which people are able to participate in social relationships under conditions which enhance their well-being, capacities and potential and enables them to shape their own circumstances and contribute to societal development. We assessed whether women in homeless shelters differed from men on social quality factors that constitute the quality of their daily life and whether factor scores changed at a different rate for women and men after shelter exit. Data were collected as part of a randomised controlled trial. In 18 shelters across the Netherlands, 183 participants were recruited between December 2010 and December 2012 and followed for 9 months. Adults were eligible if they were about to move from shelter to (supported) independent housing and their shelter stay had been shorter than 14 months. At baseline, women were significantly younger than men. They were more likely to have children, to have minor children staying with them, to be lower educated, to be unemployed and to have been victimised than men. Women had used more services and reported lower self-esteem, less satisfaction with health and empowerment and higher psychological distress. They were less likely than men to have used alcohol excessively or cannabis. We found no significant differences between women and men in changes over time on the social quality factors. As women were disadvantaged at baseline compared to men regarding many factors, we concluded that women in homeless shelters are a particularly vulnerable group. Moreover, an opportunity remains for shelter services to improve women's social quality during and after their shelter stay.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

N2  - Few studies have evaluated the impact of nutritional supplementation among pregnant adolescents. We examined the effects of the Rang Din Nutrition Study (RDNS) interventions on children born to mothers <20 years of age. The RDNS was a cluster-randomized effectiveness trial with four arms: (1) women and children both received small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS-LNS), (2) women received iron and folic acid (IFA) and children received LNS (IFA-LNS), (3) women received IFA and children received micronutrient powder (MNP) (IFA-MNP), and (4) women received IFA and children received no supplements (IFA-Control). We enrolled 4011 women at <20 weeks gestation; 1552 were adolescents. Among adolescents, prenatal LNS reduced newborn stunting by 25% and small head size by 28% and had a marginally significant effect on newborn wasting, compared with IFA. Low birth weight and preterm birth were reduced only among adolescents with lower food security. Effects on subsequent growth status were observed only among female children in the LNS-LNS group: less stunting at 18 months (versus IFA-MNP) and lower prevalence of small head circumference and wasting at 24 months (versus IFA-Control). Initiatives targeting pregnant adolescents in similar settings should consider inclusion of small-quantity LNS, particularly for adolescents living in food-insecure households.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: While much research has sought to identify the factors associated with initiation and cessation of various forms of drug use among vulnerable youth, little is known about relapse into drug use in this population. We sought to characterise relapse into stimulant and opioid use among street-involved youth in Vancouver, Canada. DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected between 2005 and 2017 from the At-Risk Youth Study, a prospective cohort study of street-involved youth who use illicit drugs in Vancouver. Multivariable extended Cox regression was utilised to identify factors associated with relapse into illegal stimulants and/or opioids among youth who had previously ceased using stimulants and/or opioids for 6 months or longer. RESULT(S): Among 246 participants who reported a period of cessation lasting 6 months or longer, 165 (67.1%) relapsed at some point during study follow-up. Youth who were recently incarcerated (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]: 1.46), homeless (AHR: 1.43), or had a history of daily stimulant use (AHR: 1.48) were significantly more likely to report relapse, while youth of who identified as white (AHR: 0.74) were significantly less likely to report relapse (all P < 0.05). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION(S): Relapse into stimulants and/or opioids was common among youth in our setting, and incarceration, homelessness, and daily stimulant use were found to be positively associated with relapse among youth. Findings suggest that increased access to youth housing supports and alternatives to the criminalisation of drug use may help to reduce the rates of relapse into stimulants and/or opioids in this population.Copyright © 2019 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.

N2  - Despite decades of comparative research, how selection shapes the evolution of cognitive traits remains poorly understood [1-3]. Several lines of evidence suggest that natural selection acts on spatial memory in food-caching species [3-6]. However, a link between reproductive fitness and spatial memory ability has yet to be demonstrated in any caching species [1, 3, 6]. Here, we show that memory performance influences reproductive success differentially for males and females in a caching songbird, the New Zealand robin (Petroica longipes). Males' memory performance in a spatial task during winter influenced their subsequent breeding success; individuals with more accurate performance produced more fledglings and independent offspring per nesting attempt. Males with superior memory performance also provided an increased proportion of large prey items to chicks in the nest and spent less time flying while foraging and provisioning. No such effects were found for females. Previous research reveals that trade-offs may constrain selection and act to maintain variation in cognitive traits [7]. The gender dimorphism in the reproductive benefits of robin memory performance suggests an additional role for divergent selection between the sexes in constraining runaway selection on male memory ability [8], ultimately maintaining variation in this cognitive trait.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background Tuberculosis (TB) remains a public health problem in the UK-born population of England, including among young adults. Ecological studies indicate that deprivation is an important risk factor for TB, but there are few recent individual- level studies in high income countries that have investigated the association between poverty-related social determinants of health inequality (SDH) and TB. Our objective was to measure the association between individual socio-economic status and social determinants of health, and TB, taking into account the clustering of social risk factors in individuals, and to estimate the potential population impact on TB rates. Methods Secondary analyses of a nationwide case-control study conducted among UK-born White adults aged 23 to 38 years at diagnosis of their first TB episode, and randomly selected age and sex frequency-matched community controls. Data on some SDH (education, household overcrowding, tobacco smoking, alcohol use, drugs use, and history of homelessness and prison) were collected in face-to-face interviews. Statistical analyses, using logistic regression models, was informed by a theoretical causal framework (Directed Acyclic Graph) of plausible inter-relationships between the measured social factors. Results Overall, 681 TB cases and 1183 controls were recruited. The risk of TB was about four times higher in subjects whose formal education was up to GCSE O-levels or less compared to those with at least a university degree (OR=3.94; 95%CI: 2.74; 5.67), after controlling for other TB risk factors (age, sex, BCG vaccination and stays in Africa or Asia for 33 months). After simultaneously adjusting for these risk factors and all measured social determinants, higher TB risk was also independently associated with tobacco smoking, use of drugs (especially injectable drugs - OR=5.67; 95% CI: 2.68; 11.98), history of homelessness and deprivation in the area of residence. Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) estimates suggested that tobacco use and class-A drug use were, respectively, responsible for 18% and 15% of TB cases in the target population. Conclusion The results provide insight into some of the mechanisms through which deprivation increases the risk of TB in the general population in England and support the argument for improved approaches to TB control efforts, such as integrated health and social services in high-risk young adult populations.

N2  - Background: The Canadian HCV Clinical Practice Guidelines recommends HCV birth cohort screening; however there has yet to be uptake studies in primary care (PC) in Canada Primary care providers (PCPs) are also often the first point of contact for at-risk populations In particular, Nurse Practitioners (NPs) have been shown to be more likely than their physician colleagues to work with youth; those who are homeless; spend more time in street outreach; and accommodate walk-ins A recent US study demonstrated that although visits to PCPs following a positive HCV RNA are increasing and greatly exceed specialty; PC treatment initiation remains low Yet, data from the ASCEND trial demonstrated that once treatment is initiated, SVR rates in PC are higher than specialty; with appointment adherence highest among NP-treaters In many provinces in Canada, NPs practice autonomously and do not have any restrictions on prescribing, including DAA therapy Despite this, novel methods to engage NPs in the HCV care cascade has not occurred. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a systematic approach for PC NPs to become HCV site champions in screening, case-finding and treatment in primary care. Method(s): We engaged 32 NPs within Canada's largest family health team serving 150,000 patients across 19 sites NPs in FHTs already provide specialised services such as mental health, women's health, and chronic disease management Thus, in the proposed model NPs would receive internal referrals from their physician colleagues and be involved in education and training of the team NPs received a one-hour overview of the study, followed by a one-day training provided by NPs, a hepatologist, and an experienced HCV pharmacist. NPs were encouraged to screen as per the guidelines; and organically develop approaches to engage team members NPs were given intake and treatment algorithms, and the number and types of inquiries from NPs were recorded Results: Since the initiation of the study, 8 NPs participated in the single day training. After five months, NPs have screened 538 individuals Interestingly, one NP mailed requisitions for birth cohort screening to a single roster (902 patients), with 101 results received in one week, and 346 returned by week 12. Eight antibody positive patients were identified thus far across all sites, all of whom returned for an HCV RNA, with 7/8 positive, and 6/7 patients have initiated therapy There has been 17 times where NPs asked questions regarding clinical management of 7 patients Treatment in speciality populations and disease severity were the most common themes The 10-month screening, treatment initiation, and SVR rates will be available at AASLD Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrates that formalized initiatives to engage and educate NPs in screening and treatment of HCV has the potential to uncover innovative strategies and create NP leaders in the elimination of HCV in Canada.

T1  - The impact of loss of feed-forward inhibition in the thalamo-cortical network of a mouse model of absence epilepsy
T3  - 33rd International Epilepsy Congress. Bangkok Thailand.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Purpose: Absence seizures are most common in children aged 4-14 years and are characterized by behavioural arrest and brief but frequent periods of staring. Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), which accounts for ~10% of all pediatric epilepsies is a genetic, generalized, nonconvulsive form of epilepsy. While the hallmark spikewave discharges (SWD) seen in absence seizures arise from disturbances within the thalamocortical network (TCN), the underlying mechanisms are unclear and appear to be multifactorial. Anti-epileptic drugs either fail to control the seizures or induce adverse side-effects in one-third of patients. Hence, there is a need for a clearer understanding of seizure generation at the cellular and molecular level so that more targeted, patient-specific approaches can be developed for the treatment of CAE. We previously demonstrated that absence seizures are associated with dysfunctional feedforward-inhibitory interneurons in the somatosensory cortex (SSC) and thalamus in the stargazer mouse model of absence epilepsy. Feed-forward inhibition (FFI) is essential to prevent runaway excitation and is mediated by fast-spiking parvalbumin-containing (PV+) inhibitory interneurons. The aim of the current study was to investigate the impact of loss of FFI within the TCN on absence seizure generation and behaviour. Method(s): We used DREADD technology to selectively silence the activity of PV + feedforward interneurons in PVCre x G i-DREADD floxed mice to test the impact of loss of FFI within TCN microcircuits. Video-EEG recordings and motor function tests were conducted before and after injection of Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO). Result(s): Injection of CNO focally (into SSC or thalamus) resulted in behavioural arrest and bursts of paroxysmal oscillatory activity with characteristics of SWDs; peripheral injections additionally caused motor impairment on rotarod and open-field testing. Conclusion(s): These data suggest loss of FFI is associated with pathological oscillations within the TCN accompanied by behavioural arrest and therefore could be a target for future improved treatment strategies.

N2  - Introduction: Caring for a family member or friend with chronic illness increases cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk by 82% compared to non-caregivers, and rurality imparts additional CVD disparities. Known as "hidden patients", caregivers commonly have undetected psychological, social, economic, environmental and physical problems. Purpose(s): The purpose of this study was to describe a profile of informal rural caregivers of patients with chronic illnesses to determine prevalence of CVD risk factors, and psychosocial and socioeconomic burden. Method(s): Baseline data from a trial of CVD risk reduction in rural caregivers of patients with chronic illnesses were used. We measured depression and anxiety with the PHQ-9 and Brief Symptom Inventory; social, economic and environmental factors using the MOS-Social Support and the Economic and Environmental surveys; and comorbidities using the Charlson Comorbidity Index, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), and lipid profile. Result(s): Of 181 caregivers (age 53+14 years, 80% female), 69% were married; 88% were caring for a family member including 46% caring for a spouse, 18% for a parent, 12% for a child. A total of 51% were anxious, 25% depressed, and 25% reported lack of social support. Another 18% did not have enough to make ends meet, 12% worried they could become homeless, 19% had trouble paying utilities, and 9% felt unsafe in their home. Most (51%) caregivers had one or more types of CVD including stroke, or myocardial infarction; 22% have chronic lung disease; 21% had diabetes and 49% were smokers. By exam, 76% had elevated BP by diagnostic criteria; 35% had total cholesterol > 200, 50% low-density lipoprotein > 100, 35% triglycerides > 200; and 64% had high density lipoprotein < 50. Based on BMI.91.5% were overweight or obese. Conclusion(s): Rural caregivers are at markedly increased risk of CVD and struggle with other factors that make caregiving difficult and burdensome and contribute to their own poor cardiac health. Comprehensive assessment of caregivers by healthcare providers is essential in order to identify and address psychological, social, economic, environmental and physical problems that can result in poor physical and mental health outcomes for caregivers.

N2  - Introduction: School attendance, particularly chronic absenteeism, remains a persistent, challenging, and complex problem for schools. In the last few years, school start times have become a more prominent focus of education policy and practice. Prior studies have demonstrated that delayed school start times for adolescents result in increased sleep duration, as well as improved academic performance, reduced daytime sleepiness, depressive symptoms, tardiness, and attendance. This study was conducted to determine whether sleep duration and circadian preference are also cross-sectionally associated with school attendance among middle school students at baseline, prior to a scheduled multi-year plan for delaying school start times in the Madison (Wisconsin) Metropolitan School District (MMSD). Material(s) and Method(s): All MMSD middle school students (grades 6-8) were invited to complete an online survey regarding sleep habits, symptoms, and attendance in the spring of 2019. Circadian preference was determined using the self-morningness/eveningness (Self-ME) questionnaire. Habitual sleep duration was estimated as the weighted self-reported sleep time on school days and non-school days. Linear mixed effect models were utilized with attendance rate as the primary outcome variable, with age, sex, race, English language learner status, homelessness, parental educational level, free-and-reduced lunch status, circadian preference, and habitual sleep duration as covariates. School was accounted for as a source of nonindependence. To minimize outlier effects on models, students with reported sleep duration < 4 or >12 hours were excluded. Result(s): Data from 2,715 students (mean age=11.9+/-0.9 years; 51.8% female) were included in the analysis. In the fully adjusted model, weighted sleep duration (beta=0.55, SE=0.16, p=0.01) and circadian preference (beta=-0.44 SE=0.15, p=0.02) were each significantly associated with attendance rate, such that reduced sleep duration and a delayed circadian preference were related to decreased attendance. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that sleep duration and circadian preference are factors that are associated with school attendance in early adolescence. These findings strengthen calls for delayed school start times that account for circadian preference and target increasing sleep duration among students. Future research that examines within-subject effects of delaying school start times, as well as qualitative aspects of such interventions are warranted.

N2  - Background: The first 5 years of life are crucial for optimising growth, health, and cognitive development. However, many children do not reach their full cognitive and developmental potential because of multilevel barriers, including those resulting from poverty and homelessness. This review aims to summarise the evidence characterising the barriers to optimal health and cognitive outcomes and to accessing health services, focusing on homeless children younger than 5 years of age (under 5s), which is one of the most vulnerable populations. Method(s): For this narrative review, we searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, OVID Maternity and Infant Care, and The Cochrane Library (publications dates from Jan 1, 1980, to Aug 5, 2019) without language restrictions using the key words and MESH headings "homelessness", "housing", "paediatrics", "interpersonal relations", "social exclusion", "toddler", "children under 5", "engagement", and "communication and insecurity". The search strategy yielded 1663 articles. Retrieved articles were organised by study design. Because of the considerable heterogeneity of methods and outcomes, we used a narrative synthesis approach following guidelines by the University of York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. The primary outcome was barriers to optimal health and accessing health services, focusing on under 5s. Finding(s): 24 full texts were selected in the final synthesis, including primary research studies and systematic or narrative reviews from high-income countries. There was little evidence describing links among housing insecurity, health, and cognitive outcomes in under 5s. This age group was rarely studied as a discrete group and often combined with older ages (eg, <=24 years). The quality of articles varied greatly because of the heterogeneity in study design. Nevertheless, we identified important themes: barriers were described at the individual and family level (eg, race or ethnicity, immigration status, and fear), system level (eg, poor access to medication, absence of care plan, and no insurance) and community level (eg, transportation limitations and poor housing conditions). Interpretation(s): More methodologically rigorous research is needed to identify what barriers exist for under 5s and their parents in accessing health services, and how this affects the child's health. Such data is needed to promote the co-production of cross-sector tailored interventions to address these barriers by working directly with experts by experience of social exclusion and their children.

T1  - 13.2 SMARTPHONE AND TABLET INTERVENTIONS FOR UNDERSERVED AND AT-RISK YOUTH
T3  - 66th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry. Chicago United States.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Objectives: The goal of this session is to present results from 2 research studies that use digital health tools for underserved and at-risk youth. Method(s): Both studies use community-based research settings in Chicago. One study uses a randomized control design to examine the impact of a tablet-based screening and brief motivational interviewing intervention for young men who have sex with men and young transgender women (N = 410) seeking HIV testing. In this study, the sample group is 90 percent cis-male, 10 percent transgender, 61 percent gay, 24 percent bisexual, 10 percent queer, 3 percent straight, 30 percent non-Hispanic white, 37 percent non-Hispanic black, 25 percent Hispanic/Latinx, and 8 percent other. The second study examines the feasibility of using smartphones and a suite of preloaded coaching and mental health apps to engage homeless youth (N = 65). In this study, the sample group is 50 percent cis-female, 45 percent cis-male, 5 percent transgender, 50 percent non-Hispanic black, 23 percent other, 20 percent Hispanic/Latinx, and 9 percent non-Hispanic white. Result(s): Youth showed high engagement with both modalities. Youth preferred brief interventions, such as surveys and tips, and expressed that interventions with flexibility for completion were preferable to more standard interventions. Youth exposed to the brief motivational interviewing intervention showed reductions in binge episodes and the number of drinks of alcohol. Youth using the smartphone suite did not show significant clinical change over the course of the study. Conclusion(s): Further research is warranted on the use of digital health interventions of youth. Despite high engagement and retention, interventions probably need to be modified to fit these new and emerging modalities. The use of chatbots and other automated designs have the potential to reach youth in real time for help and support, especially when traditional systems of care are less available or limited.

N2  - Objectives: Survivors of child sex-trafficking experience a high prevalence of complex trauma that increases their risk for resulting mental illness. However, the actual prevalence of mental health disorders in these children is unknown. This study aimed: 1) to examine the prevalence of mental health diagnoses among a sample group of youth identified as being sex trafficked; and 2) to compare these rates to sample groups of high-risk groups reported in the literature. Our hypothesis was that victims of trafficking would have a higher prevalence of mental illness compared with other high-risk groups. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 143 child trafficking victims, identifying mental health diagnoses and behaviors. A literature review was conducted for studies on runaway children, juvenile offenders, and foster children to serve as comparisons. A binomial-normal model was used to estimate the prevalence of mental health disorders within each high-risk group. A comparison of the prevalence in our study to that in the literature was done using a one-sample proportion test. Result(s): We observed significantly higher rates of ADHD (52.4%, p < 0.001 [95% CI = 44.3, 60.5]) and bipolar disorder (26.6%, p < 0.001 [95% CI = 20.0, 34.4]) in trafficked youth versus all high-risk groups, and of depression (45.5%), anxiety (19.6%), PTSD (19.6%), conduct disorder (19.6%), ODD (25.9%), and psychosis (14.0%) relative to many groups individually. Conclusion(s): There is a higher prevalence of mental health disorders among child victims of sex trafficking compared with other high-risk groups. However, overlapping symptomology may lead to improper diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders. Alternative diagnoses and treatment that characterize the complex dysfunction resulting from sex trafficking may ensure prompt access to trauma-focused therapies. However, our conclusions are limited by the retrospective nature of our study, the overlap between comparison groups, and the discrepancies in literature study characteristics.

N2  - Objectives: This Clinical Perspectives will provide insights and understanding into working with vulnerable youth and families, including homeless families, lower socioeconomic status families, ethnic minority families, and youth who are LGBTQ. These populations are at especially high risk for the negative impact of depression and stress. Method(s): Four different perspectives on resilience skill building using a trauma-informed and family-centered lens with vulnerable populations will be presented. First, Lauren Marlotte, PsyD, will describe adapting a family-centered, trauma-informed, evidence-based practice for adolescents with depression. She will discuss cultural adaptations and outcomes of an RCT at a school-based clinic with low-income minorities. Second, Roya Ijadi-Maghsoodi, MD, will discuss adapting a family-centered preventive intervention for homeless families. She will share qualitative findings and offer recommendations for using a family-centered lens in working with homeless families. Third, Eric Fein, MD, will discuss the development and implementation of school-based groups to promote resilience and family wellness with predominately ethnic minority parents/caregivers. He will demonstrate effective tools for building parenting resilience. Fourth, Natalie Ramos, MD, will discuss a resilience skill-building group for depressed LGBTQ adolescents. She will explain the development of the group and mental health outcomes. Sheryl Kataoka, MD, an expert on trauma-informed interventions and school mental health and the co-chair of the AACAP Schools Committee, will serve as the discussant. Result(s): The 4 presenters from an array of specialty areas will discuss reaching vulnerable populations. Each will present the impact of the program on depression and stress. They will offer new approaches, insights, and practical recommendations for working with vulnerable populations. Conclusion(s): Although vulnerable populations can be challenging to engage in mental health services, these innovative approaches presented are effective interventions and offer strategies to support youth and families. Providers will be able to use the insights gained and practical tools to improve their quality of care and to understand new ways of engaging hard-to-reach families. RF, CC, SPCopyright © 2019

N2  - Background/Aims: Studies showed that double burden of malnutrition is associated to food insecurity. One among coping strategies to food insecurity is migration. This analysis is aimed to test association between household food security with child overweight and risk of inadequate intake of vitamin A or iron in labour migration pocket area. Method(s): Analysis of data from a cross sectional study conducted in labor-migration pocket area of Tulungagung District, Indonesia in 2010 is performed. Sample size was 157 randomly selected children aged 2-5 years old who left by the mothers to work abroad. Household food security was assessed by using the US Household Food Security Survey Module (USFSSM). Micronutrient intake, i.e. vitamin A and iron were calculated by using repeated 24 hours food recall method. Risk of inadequate intake were defined when they were less than the estimated average requirement. Chi square test were done to analyze association of household food security status with overweight and one of micronutrient inadequacy. Result(s): As much as 24.8% households were food-insecure. Significant association was found between household food security status and overweight-vitamin A inadequacy (fisher's exact test, p < 0.05) However, there was no significant association between household food security status and overweight-iron inadequacy, even-though higher percentage of children with overweight and inadequate iron were found in food insecure households. Conclusion(s): Issue of hidden hunger need to be explored when relates household food security and nutritional issues of children from heavy out migration area, since they were at risk of lacking proper child-feeding which may influence their dietary quality.

N2  - Background Women attending specialist sexual health and contraception clinics (SHAC) are younger and more likely to report substance use and sexual risk behaviours than those attending Primary Care (PC). A broader analysis of psychosocial differences between these populations may improve our understanding of the wider determinants of sexual risk and morbidity and support the development of psychosocial interventions for use in specialist settings. We therefore explored which psychosocial factors were associated with recruitment site. Methods Psychosocial question responses were compared from a cross-sectional survey of convenience-sampled women aged 16-44 years attending PC (Primary Care) vs SHAC services in the city of Brighton and Hove, UK. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify which psychosocial factors predicted attendance in SHAC versus PC. Results 1238 (70%) eligible women completed a questionnaire in a PC setting and 532 (30%) women in a SHAC service. After controlling for age, several psychosocial factors predicted SHAC compared to PC attendance. These included: living in rented accommodation (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.70,95% confidence interval (CI):1.20-2.40), being a cigarette smoker (aOR=1.32,95%CI:1.00-1.75), disagreement that 'having a partner at all times is important to me' (aOR=2.24,95% CI:1.69-2.97) emotional dissatisfaction with most recent relationship (aOR=1.51,95%CI:1.15-1.99) and little or no functional social support (e.g. help with chores and meals) (aOR=1.83,95%CI:1.21-2.78). Conclusion Findings suggest that women attending SHAC may be more likely to experience lack of support and dissatisfaction with sexual and other relationships, and may be more likely to be in rented or other insecure housing compared with those attending primary care settings. Thus, the potential impact of broader life circumstances on sexual risk may be worthy of discussion during clinical and health advisor consultations.

N2  - Background Little is known about factors influencing HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) utilization among young urban transgender women (TW), transgender men (TM) and men who have sex with men (MSM), who are disproportionately affected by HIV. This prospective pilot study explores PrEP adherence and persistence among these traditionally underserved communities in primary care clinics located in community centers serving LGBTQ youth. Methods To examine factors related to PrEP outcomes, we established a cohort of PrEP-eligible young TW, TM and MSM at two clinics located in LGBTQ community centers and followed participants monthly. We measured tenofovir diphosphate levels at 12 weeks to assess adherence, defined as having a value >700 fmol/punch. Persistence was defined as picking up 2 refills during 12 weeks of follow up. Multivariate analysis will be used to describe associations between demographic, behavioral, social, and clinical characteristics and outcomes. Results Of the 50 participants, 25 were TW, 6 TM and 19 MSM. ~75% were African American, ~10% white and ~5% Hispanic/Latino; average age 24.18. Results to date shows 27% adherence and 55% persistence. Taking hormones at baseline was inversely related to PrEP persistence, Relative Risk=0.67 (0.39-1.15) p=0.14. The trend is similar for adherence, RR=0.65 (0.20-2.1), p=0.48. Conclusion Combining gender affirming hormones and PrEP in community spaces for LGBTQ youth is a novel approach to engage a traditionally hard-to-reach population. While initial data shows low PrEP outcomes, the relatively high number of patients remaining in care (84%) demonstrates an opportunity to improve adherence and clinical outcomes. We observed that integrating hormone therapy with PrEP administration did not positively impact outcomes, suggesting that other factors (e.g. homelessness, trauma) are important. These findings indicate the need to develop interventions designed to address these factors while continuing to integrate PrEP with gender affirming services .

N2  - Background: Low-income and marginalized populations experience poorer health outcomes and lower access to health-promoting resources. The wide adoption of mobile phones in these populations could serve as a means to address systematic barriers to healthcare and resource access. In this study, we aim to explore resource needs and barriers to accessing services for social determinants of health among marginalized communities to inform the user-centered design of a mobile intervention. Method(s): Participants were purposefully recruited to participate in focus groups from low-income and marginalized populations through partnerships with three local community organization addressing mental health, food insecurity, and youth homelessness in New Haven, CT. We conducted focus groups located at these community-based organizations using a semi-structured moderator's guide. This guide was developed and iteratively refined by our qualitative research team to explore: (1) how participants navigate community resources, (2) barriers to resource access, and (3) perspectives on key requirements to optimize the usability and usefulness of a mobile application to improve resource access. We also reviewed prototypes of the mobile application to obtain more specific feedback. All focus groups were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Result(s): To date, we have completed three focus groups with 20 participants (4-8/group) ages 19-64 years. Participants were 47% male, 63% African-American, 42% had completed high school or less, 90% reported having access to a smartphone and out of those, 94% used "apps". Participants identified the primary sources of information on community resources as: disorganized and frequently inaccurate electronic resources, advertising at local community programs, and word of mouth. Barriers to resource access included lack of awareness, lack of centralized resources and outdated information, and distrust towards organizations and staff. Participants expressed that a mobile application to improve resource access should include comprehensive, up-to-date information, facilitate peer-to-peer communication and advocacy, and provide resources tailored to an individual's unique needs. Conclusion(s): Engaging target end-users in the development of interventions is more likely to yield a design that will be effective and highly adopted. Focus group participants from marginalized populations described an existing resource system that is disorganized and information-limited and defined several modifiable barriers to accessing resources to address social determinants of health. A centralized mobile application could introduce standardization, improve the reliability and accuracy of information, capitalize on and expand existing social networks and forms of information sharing, and facilitate tailored resource recommendations.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The CASL HCV Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend HCV birth cohort screening; however there has yet to be uptake studies in primary care in Ontario (PC). Primary care providers (PCPs) are also often the first point of contact for at-risk populations. In particular, Nurse Practitioners (NPs) have been shown to be more likely than their physician colleagues to work with youth; those who are homeless; spend more time in street outreach; and accommodate walkins. A recent US study demonstrated that although visits to PCPs following a positive HCV RNA are increasing and greatly exceed specialty; PC treatment initiation remains low. Yet, data from the ASCEND trial demonstrated that once treatment is initiated, SVR rates in PC are significantly higher than specialty; with appointment adherence highest among NP-treaters. In many provinces, NPs currently prescribe DAA therapy, though novel methods to engage NPs has not occured. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a systematic approach for PC NPs to become HCV site champions. METHOD(S): We engaged NPs within two models of PC in London, Ontario. The first, included 30 NPs from Canada's largest family health team (FHT), with 19 sites, and 150,000 patients. In FHT models, an NP sees clients rostered to several GPs. In the second organization, a Nurse Practitioner- Led Clinic (NPLC), with two sites, 4 NPs act as MRPs. Although much smaller, many NPLCs serve populations at-risk for HCV acquisition. NPs received a 1-day NP/hepatologist-led training, and ongoing continuing education. NPs were encouraged to screen as per the guidelines; and organically develop approaches to engage team members. As screening rates were already high in the NPLC, the objective was to chart review and create a HCV-free NPLC. NPs were given intake and treatment algorithms, and the number and types of inquiries from NPs were recorded. Questions requiring specialist consult were answered by a hepatologist. RESULT(S): 11 NPs participated in the single day training. After 2.5 months of screening, FHT NPs have screened 192 individuals. Interestingly, one NP mailed requisitions for birth cohort screening for a single roster (902 patients), with 101 results received in 1 week. To date, no new positives have been identified within the FHT, but 4/7 NPs have initiated care with 6 known positive patients; 3 now on DAAs. Within the NPLC, one NP caseload has been reviewed; yielding 98 screens. Of this cohort 2/98 new RNA positives were identified, and 2/98 were known positives not engaged in care. All four have achieved SVR. The 6 month screening, treatment initiation, and SVR rates will be available at CanHepC. CONCLUSION(S): Our study demonstrates that formalized initiatives to engage and educate NPs in screening and treatment of HCV has the potential to uncover innovative strategies, and create NP leaders in the treatment and elimination of HCV in Ontario.

N2  - Purpose: High rates of substance use and sexual risk behavior among young adults experiencing homelessness speak to the need for effective risk reduction programs for this vulnerable population. Yet individuals experiencing homelessness can be challenging to engage in services and retain over time in intervention studies. We present results from a pilot cluster cross-over randomized controlled trial of AWARE, a brief four-session group-based motivational interviewing (MI) intervention focused on both substance use and sexual risk behavior. We also discuss an ongoing trial to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of AWARE, including strategies being employed to engage and retain homeless young adults in the program and research study. Methods/Data: For the pilot study, 200 homeless young adults ages 18-25 (mean age = 21.8) received the AWARE program (n = 100) or usual care control (n = 100) at one of two drop-in centers. The sample was 73%male, 79%heterosexual, and 31%non-Hispanic white. Surveys were completed at baseline and three months after programcompletion. The current trial involves conducting 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Result(s): AWARE participants in the pilot study self-reported positive change in their past 3 month and past 30 day alcohol use (ps <= 0.05), motivation to change drug use (ps < 0.05), and condom use self-efficacy (p = 0.05) compared to the control group. Among those withmultiple sex partners, AWARE participants showed a decrease in unprotected sexual events (p < 0.05), whereas the control group did not. Strategies that are currently being used in the larger evaluation to engage homeless young adults in the program, encourage program completion, and track and resurvey the sample over a 12-month are presented. Conclusion(s): Pilot esults suggest that a brief group-MI risk reduction intervention can be effective in helping homeless young adultsmake positive short-termchanges in their alcohol and condom use. However, evaluating the longer-term outcomes of AWARE requires innovative strategies to successfully engage, track, and retain homeless young adults over time. The strategies presented can help inform other efforts to engage homeless youth in clinical trials, as well as behavioral health services more generally.

T1  - THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SOCIAL CAPITAL AND PREGNANCY ATTITUDES AMONG YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS
T3  - 75th Annual Clinical and Scientific Conference. Halifax Convention Centre, Halifax Canada.

N2  - Objectives: Homeless youth demonstrate high rates of pregnancy and pregnancy involvement. Many youth view pregnancy positively; some extant research has depicted homeless youths' pro-pregnancy attitudes as a function of youth being in desperate need of resources, such as money, food, clothing, housing, and healthcare. However, knowledge of the association between youths' receipt of specific sources and types of social support and their pregnancy attitudes is limited. Method(s): Social network data were collected from 1,010 homeless youth (ages 15-24). Logistic regressions assessed how specific forms of social support (informational, instrumental, emotional), provided by youths' social network members (street-based peers, home-based peers, family members, service providers, serious partners), were associated with youths' pro-pregnancy attitude endorsements. Result(s): Multivariate results demonstrated one significant association; youth who reported receipt of instrumental support (e.g., monetary resources) from a serious partner were significantly more likely to endorse pro-pregnancy attitudes compared to their peers who did not receive such form of support (OR=1.46, p<.05). Conclusion(s): Several studies report that female homeless youth, in particular, feel "trapped" by their need for monetary resources. Their lack of economic capital thus sometimes causes them to go to great lengths, including becoming pregnant, merely to maintain access to supports, especially when pregnancy is perceived as desired by a male partner who provides such benefits. Findings suggest a need for creating dyadic communication and prevention activities that facilitate homeless youths' conversations about their economic resource needs, as part of discussions about their pregnancy motivations and relationship goals, in ways that foster informed, self-determined reproductive health decision-making.Copyright © 2019 The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada

N2  - Objectives: ADHD is widely recognized as neurodevelopmental disorder with predominant genetic aetiology. Nevertheless, there are numerous environmental factors that may increase the risk of ADHD in children. One of them is prenatal exposure to stress. There is a need of farther studies aimed to examine the relation between objective stressors acting during pregnancy and ADHD in offspring. It is possible in research focused on consequences of adverse, traumatic events, e.g. natural disasters. The aim of the study was to examine the level of ADHD symptoms in children of mothers exposed during pregnancy to the Aila Cyclone in West Bengal, India, May 2009. Method(s): The Aila Cyclone was a strong tropical storm which was responsible for at least 339 deaths and left about 1 million people homeless across India and Bangladesh. The level of symptoms of ADHD was compared between the sample of 182 children, age 8 years, with prenatal exposure to the Aila Cyclone (ACExp) and the control group (CG) included 189 of their peers from the area of similar level of urbanization to the ACExp but unaffected by Aila Cyclone. The short version of the Conners' Teacher Rating Scale- Revised (CTRS-R-S) was used to assess the level of ADHD symptoms. The differences in ADHD symptoms between ACExp and CG were tested using ANOVA. GLM analysis was applied to control sex, gestational age and birth weight effects. Result(s): The analysis adjusted to possible confounding factors revealed significantly increased ADHD symptoms in ACExp in comparison to CG, indicated by the total CTRS-R-S score, ADHD index and Hyperactivity, Cognitive problems/Inattention and Oppositional subscales. Conclusion(s): The level of ADHD symptoms was found higher in children affected by the Aila Cyclone. This result underline the role of prenatal stress as a factor affecting the development of child's nervous system and its importance in the ADHD aetiology.

N2  - Background: The Guddi Partners Project is a collaboration between Synapse; Specialist Disability Services Assessment and Outreach Team, Department of Communities, Disability Services, and Seniors; Griffith University; and Indigenous communities. We form partnerships with communities and organizations to develop culturally safe ways of understanding complex disablement including mental health disorders and neurocognitive disability. We advocate for policy and service development and reform built on this knowledge. Objective(s): This session aims to: * establish the extent and nature of complex disablement among marginalized Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; * enhance service capacity to understand and respond effectively to this cohort using culturally safe processes; * promote intersectoral collaboration and influence policy. Method(s): Multiple projects focused on the needs of Indigenous people with complex disabilities, underpinned by community partnerships and rigorous mixed-method data analysis. Central to the project is the Guddi Protocol, a culturally safe assessment tool, and 'Proper Way' methodologies. Each piece of work stands alone but is linked to the others by framework, structure, values and methodologies. Finding(s): A total of 250 Guddi assessments undertaken across Australia revealed high levels of complex disability and high service uptake of the Guddi Protocol. The evidence base established has informed policy and service development by focusing on the needs of First Peoples who experience complex disability. Conclusion(s): Research within The Guddi Project can inform effective, culturally safe evidence-based policy reform. Better understandings of complex disability across sectors including mental health and disability; homelessness; criminal justice; and youth justice are needed to inform policy and practice.

N2  - Introduction: Novel psychoactive substances (NPS) have emerged over the last decade as alternative to classical drugs of abuse. The emergence of these substances was continuous at a rate of once a week with over 800 reported substances in March 2018 [1]; despite their control under the NPS Act 2016. NPS popularity diffused to vulnerable members of society (e.g. homelessness) was attributed unique subjective effects associated with them. However, many effects and adverse effects attributed to NPS particularly relating to users' experiences remain uncovered. Aim(s): The purpose of this pilot study is to explore knowledge and experience of the homeless population regarding NPS. The specific objectives include the following: * Identifying the demographic factors of the homeless population using novel psychoactive substances * Uncovering desired effects sought by users of NPS * Assessing the adverse effects associated with NPS. Method(s): A semi-structured questionnaire was distributed to homeless population via homeless shelters (n = 3) between April and August 2018. Eligible participants were those who were who were rough sleepers and were aged range of 18-64 years old. The questionnaire was divided into five parts that covered the following areas: (1) demographic characteristics of users, (2) NPS use, (3) motivations behind using NPS, (4) desired effects and (5) adverse effects of NPS. Ethical approval for the study was sought from Bournemouth University Internal Ethics Committee (ID 20840). Data analysis was conducted using SPSS v25. Result(s): A total of 21 questionnaires were completed by users. The majority of participants were males (n = 19), white (n = 18) and heterosexual (n = 17). Participants mainly reported the use of 'Spice' via smoking route. Other NPS reported were Black mamba and mephedrone. The main motivation behind consuming 'Spice' was self-treatment of physical conditions and/or experimentation of the psychotic effect(s). Desired effects associated with 'Spice' use were calmness, dissociations, hallucinations and sedation. However, adverse effects overweighed positive effects and in five cases required medical treatment. Reported adverse effects were as follows: addiction, aggression, anxiety, loss of consciousness, memory loss, nausea, paranoia and psychosis. Conclusion(s): The results showed that 'Spice' was the most popular NPS, used mainly for self-treatment and/ or recreational use. However, it was associated with many adverse effects such as near-death experience that required medical treatment. The aforementioned findings are useful for the healthcare professionals dealing with emergency department admission due to NPS. Furthermore, the findings support legal cases associated with NPS in drug-facilitated crimes or driving under the influence drugs. Few limitations were seen in this study. The first being that the study was based on self-reports by individuals and there was no way to verify the experience they had encountered. Moreover, participants did not specify the NPS derivative present in 'Spice'. Therefore, future studies should take into account chemical analysis of substances used by participants.

N2  - Purpose: Within the U.S., 4.3% of 13-17-year old's and 12.5% of 18-25-year old's experienced homelessness during the past year. Female homeless youth become pregnant at a rate five times greater than that of the general U.S. population, with nearly half becoming pregnant at least once during adolescence. Developing trusted, healthy relationships is a challenge for youth who are homeless. Networks can represent a potentially diverse groups of people who provide tangible or intangible resources to the individual, but also may encourage engagement in unhealthy or risky behavior. This exploratory study examines implementation data from a teen pregnancy prevention program to better understand how homeless youth social networks share information and how that information can impact the uptake of birth control. Method(s): To measure interpersonal relationships, we used a social network analysis (SNA) to assess the quality and strength of peer relationships. SNA is an ideal technique for this study because the study population is part of a bounded network defined by program participation. Eleven 14 to 18 years old participants took part in this study. Most participants were sexually active (n=9) and had first engaged in consensual sex at 13 to 18 years (M=15 years) of age. None of the participants were using birth control before the program. Data were collected through interviews and participants were asked which peers in the program they knew, who they trusted, and if they shared (or received) information on birth control. Data was symmetrized and density and centrality statistics were analyzed. Result(s): At the end of the program, 73% of the network participants were on some type of birth control at one-month follow-up. However, network density showed that only 14.3% of the network shared information about birth control. To understand if one or a few people controlled the information, centralization was analyzed on birth control information sharing. The whole network centralization was 0.339. This means that the sharing information network was centralized (> than 0.25). Degree centrality was then examined to understand who controlled information flow. One participant had a degree of 8 ties and four others had a degree of 5 ties each. Four of these 5 participants adopted some form of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) by the end of the program. One person was using condoms. Conclusion(s): While overall network density was not very high, centralization was significant which means that a few key players controlled the information flow. The majority of these individuals (4 of 5) adopted LARC by the end of the program, which may indicate that the information they shared with their peers about birth control influenced other youth's decisions on adoption. This exploratory study expands the limited research on the impact of social support on homeless youth and pregnancy prevention. 73% birth control utilization, one-month post-intervention, among a high-risk subpopulation that was not previously on birth control represents important findings for research on homeless youth.

N2  - Purpose: Homeless youth are at an increased risk of HIV infection because of negative social determinants of health (e.g., poverty and unstable housing). As a result of being at a higher risk, homeless youth should be tested for HIV so they are aware of their status, and if infected, can quickly be linked to care. During a typical summer month in the metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia area, approximately 3,374 homeless and runaway youth live on the streets, in shelters, or in other unstable housing situations. Homeless youth have substantial unmet health needs and often engage in mutually reinforcing health risk behaviors. Our aim was to better understand the prevalence of having ever been tested for HIV among homeless youth in metropolitan Atlanta. Method(s): Our analysis examined data regarding HIV testing behaviors among homeless youth aged 14-25 years in the 2015 Atlanta Youth Count and Needs Assessment (AYCNA). The AYCNA quantifies the number, and assesses the state of homeless, precariously housed, and runaway youth residing in Atlanta, Georgia. The study was designed using capture-recapture field-sampling methods. Participants were recruited by outreach and service workers that conducted observations of shelters and community locations where homeless youth spend time and reside. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Georgia State University. Chi-square analyses were conducted to determine statistically significant differences in "having ever been tested for HIV" (at p<.05 level) by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and six sexual risk behaviors. Sexual risk behaviors included: having ever experienced sexual assault or rape, having had sex in the previous year, physical abuse in a sexual relationship, sexual abuse in a sexual relationship, condom usage in the previous year, and having four or more sexual partners in the previous year. Result(s): There were 693 participants in the 2015 AYCNA sample, of which the majority were male (66.5%), aged 20-25 (70.9%), Black (70.0%), and heterosexual (73.1%). The prevalence of HIV testing was 88.4%. Prevalence of HIV testing was significantly higher among individuals who (a) were aged 20-25 years (91.6%) compared to those aged 14-19 years (80.9%), p<0.001; (b) had experienced sexual assault or rape (94.1%) compared to youth who had not (86.7%), p<0.01; (c), had not had sex in the previous year (89.5%) compared to those who did (80.2%), p<0.05; (d) had experienced physical abuse in a sexual relationship (94.2%) compared to youth who had not (87.1%), p<0.05; and (e) had experienced sexual abuse in a sexual relationship (97.6%) compared to youth who had not (87.3%), p<0.01. HIV testing did not differ significantly by race/ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, condom usage, or number of sexual partners. Conclusion(s): High prevalence of testing among homeless youth in Atlanta indicates public health success in targeting youth at risk. Nevertheless, significant differences in HIV testing prevalence suggest opportunities to improve uptake of HIV testing in younger homeless youth and those who have had sex in the previous year. Future studies should examine the linkages to care for homeless youth in Atlanta who test positive for HIV. Sources of Support: NoneCopyright © 2018

N2  - Purpose: Youth homelessness is a severe problem in the United States, wherein 4.3% of 13-17-year olds and 12.5% of 18-25-year olds experienced homelessness in the past year. Compared to the general U.S. population, homeless female youth are five times more likely to become pregnant. Limited research exists about the social networks of homeless youth, which can provide access to resources and information, as well as influence behaviors. The current study was designed to better understand social network properties among homeless female youth as they participated in a teen pregnancy prevention program. Method(s): The study used a social network analysis (SNA) to assess the quality and strength of relationships between program participants. SNA was an ideal technique because the study population was part of a network bounded by program participation. 11 participants (n=11) took part in data collection who were 14 to 18 years old. Most participants were sexually active (n=9) and first engaged in consensual sex at 13 to 18 years (M=15 years) of age. None of the participants were using birth control before the start of the program. To illustrate the connections among our sample, we created three unique networks. This was achieved by giving participants a roster of everyone in the study and asking who they knew (closeness), if they trusted them (trust), and if they shared information about sexual health. Quadratic assignment procedures (QAP) correlation analyses compared closeness and trust networks with the information sharing network, revealing how similar connections were between networks. QAPs are permutation tests that analyze bivariate correlations between two or more networks. Result(s): At the end of the program, there was a 73% uptake of birth control at the one-month post. QAP correlations revealed that trust was positively, but weakly associated with sharing information about sexual health (QAP r= 0.36, p=.008). QAP correlations also indicated that sharing information about sexual health was not associated with the closeness or knowing the other participants (QAP r=0.007, p=.157). Lastly, QAP correlation analysis showed that closeness was weakly and negatively associated to trust in other participants (QAP r=-0.114, p=.056). Conclusion(s): Results show the trust network and the information sharing network were significantly correlated in our sample, suggesting homeless, female youth are more likely to share information about sexual health to the people they trust, but not necessarily to those they are close to. Further, the closeness and trust networks were negatively correlated, indicating youth did not trust those they were closest to. While we expected trust and information sharing networks to be correlated, the negative correlation between trust and closeness was surprising. A gap between closeness and trust could be because homeless youth tend to be hurt or ostracized by previous close relationships, or because they are protective of themselves and their belongings, inhibiting trust to formulate when people get too close. Future research could further examine this social phenomenon in our population and result in better health programming and interventions for homeless youth. Sources of Support: Borgatti, S.

N2  - Objective: To investigate relationship between unstable housing and obstetric outcomes. Study Design: Data were drawn from a database of liveborn neonates linked to their mothers' hospital discharge records (2007- 2012) maintained by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. The analytic sample included singleton pregnancies with both maternal and infant data available, restricted to births between the gestational age (GA) of 20-44 weeks (N=2,963,888). Women with unstable housing ("lack of housing" or "inadequate housing") were identified using ICD-9 codes from hospital discharge records. Outcomes of interest included preterm birth (PTB, <37 weeks GA), early term birth (37-38 weeks GA), preterm labor (PTL), preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), pre-eclampsia, chorioamnionitis, extended hospitalization after delivery (vaginal birth >2 days; cesarean >4 days), emergency department (ED) visit within 1 year after delivery, and readmission within 1 year after delivery. We used exact propensity score matching without replacement to select a reference population to compare to the sample of women with unstable housing using a one-to-one ratio, matching for maternal age, race/ethnicity, parity, prior preterm birth, BMI, smoking, drug/alcohol dependence, hypertension, diabetes, mental health disorder, adequacy of prenatal care, education, and type of hospital. Odds of an adverse obstetric outcome were estimated using logistic regression. Result(s): 2,794 women with unstable housing were identified, and 85% (N=2,386) had an exact propensity score match. Compared with matched controls, women with unstable housing were at higher odds of PTL (odds ratio [OR] 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-1.4), PPROM (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6, p < 0.05), long hospitalization (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-1.9), an ED visit (OR 2.6, 95% CI 2.3-2.9), and readmission (OR 3.1, 95% CI 2.7-3.7, Figure 1). Although women with unstable housing were not at elevated odds of PTB or early term birth, the rate of PTB was high in both samples (Figure 2). Women with unstable housing were not at higher odds of pre-eclampsia nor chorioamnionitis. Conclusion(s): Although ICD codes likely underestimate its prevalence, unstable housing is a strong predictor of adverse obstetric outcomes. Interventions to improve housing stability during the prenatal period should be explored. [Figure presented] [Figure presented]Copyright © 2018

T1  - The Effect of the Earned Income Tax Credit on Housing and Living Arrangements
A1  - Pilkauskas N.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - As rents have risen and wages have not kept pace, housing affordability in the United States has declined over the last 15 years, impacting the housing and living arrangements of low-income families. Housing subsidies improve the housing situations of low-income families, but less than one in four eligible families receive a voucher. In this article, we analyze whether one of the largest anti-poverty programs in the United States-the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)-affects the housing (eviction, homelessness, and affordability) and living arrangements (doubling up, number of people in the household, and crowding) of low-income families. Using the Current Population Survey, the American Community Survey/decennial census, and the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, we employ a parameterized difference-in-differences strategy to examine whether policy-induced expansions to the EITC affect the housing and living arrangements of single mothers. Results suggest that a $1,000 increase in the EITC improves housing by reducing housing cost burdens, but it has no effect on eviction or homelessness. Increases in the EITC also reduce doubling up (living with additional, nonnuclear family adults)-in particular, doubling up in someone else's home-and reduce three-generation/multigenerational coresidence, suggesting that mothers have a preference to live independently. We find weak evidence for a reduction in overall household size, yet the EITC does reduce household crowding. Although the EITC is not an explicit housing policy, expansions to the EITC are generally linked with improved housing outcomes for single mothers and their children.

N2  - Background: Recent studies have shown that children are able to accurately describe their own experiences of food insecurity; however, few studies have quantified this experience. Objective(s): We aimed to develop and validate a child food security scale to be used in Arabic-speaking countries. Method(s): As part of the Healthy Kitchens Healthy Children study on food security and nutrition in schools, 14 questions were administered to 5-15-y-old children (n = 1433) attending 4 UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees schools. We used statistical methods based on Item Response Theory to assess the internal validity of a proposed food security scale using these items. Further validation of the scale was conducted by examining associations with sociodemographic, economic, household food security, and diet diversity variables through logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and school of the children. Result(s): A total of 1287 children (89.8%) provided complete responses to the questionnaire. Four items were dropped from the scale because of high infit statistics (>1.3) and high residual correlation with other items. The resulting 10-item scale had acceptable reliability (Cronbach alpha coefficient = 0.89). Children who reported food insecurity were more likely to be from food-insecure households (OR: 2.3; P < 0.001). Food-insecure children came from households with lower expenditures per capita (OR: 0.80; P = 0.007) and higher household crowding (OR: 1.70; P = 0.001), and had less educated mothers (OR: 0.89; P = 0.009), lower household diet diversity (OR: 0.85; P < 0.001), and lower household consumption of meat (OR: 0.89; P < 0.001) and fruit (OR: 0.95; P = 0.001). Child food insecurity was also associated with higher school absenteeism (OR: 1.64; P = 0.01) and lower academic grades in languages and science (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Child food security was accurately measured through a 10-item scale. This tool is appropriate to assess child food insecurity experience directly with children, and can be used in school-based interventions, where obtaining data from parents may be cumbersome.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.

N2  - Children and adolescents are groups that are vulnerable to the radicalism influence. Curiosity and trial-error behaviour make them tend to do risk-taking behaviours. If it is not accompanied by good self-control ability, it will encourage them to do actions without thinking about the impact of these actions (impulsivity). If it is not accompanied by empathy, then it tends to be behaviour that opposes and disrupts the interests of others (aggressive behaviour). This study aimed to assess the "Children of the Country" program as an effort to de-radicalize children and adolescents. Quasi experimental study was used on 30 children and adolescents in a shelter of street children in Surabaya with a pre-test/post-test design. In order to measure the outcome of the program, a Radical Personality Test (RPT) was developed using big five personality construct. The increase of nationalism and positive behaviour score is not much to compensate the increase of negative radicalism score. This evaluation brings awareness to form a novel de-radicalization strategy for children and adolescents in the future.Copyright © the Author(s), 2019.

N2  - Few studies examined the impact of maternal socioeconomic status and of its combined effects with environmental exposures on birthweight. Our goal was to examine the impact of maternal homelessness (mothers ever homeless or who lived in shelters during pregnancy) and participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) during pregnancy in conjunction with air pollution exposure on birthweight in the Boston-based Children's HealthWatch cohort from 2007 through 2015 (n = 3366). Birthweight was obtained from electronic health records. Information on maternal homelessness and WIC participation during pregnancy were provided via a questionnaire. Prenatal fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposures, estimated at the subject's residential address, were calculated for each trimester. We fit linear regression models adjusting for maternal and child characteristics, seasonality, and block-group-level median household income and examined the interactions between PM2.5 and each covariate. Prenatal maternal homelessness was associated with reduced birthweight (-55.7 g, 95% CI: -97.8 g, -13.7 g), while participating in WIC was marginally associated with increased birthweight (36.1 g, 95% CI: -7.3 g, 79.4 g). Only average PM2.5 during the second trimester was marginally associated with reduced birthweight (-8.5 g, 95% CI: -19.3, 2.3) for a 1 microg/m3 increase in PM2.5 . The association of PM2.5 during the second trimester with reduced birthweight was stronger among non-Hispanic Black mothers and trended toward significance among immigrants and single mothers. Our study emphasizes the independent and synergistic effects of social and environmental stressors on birthweight, particularly the potentially protective effect of participating in WIC for vulnerable populations.Copyright © 2019 by the authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Children with special health care needs (SHCNs) have significant medical and educational expenses affecting household finances. Housing instability can be detrimental to family well-being. Our objective was to evaluate housing instability in households of children with and without SHCNs. METHOD(S): Cross-sectional surveys (2013-2017) in English and Spanish of caregivers with children <4 years old were conducted at 5 hospitals. The children with SHCN screener and caregiver report of child Supplemental Security Income (SSI) receipt were used to categorize children into the following groups: (1) no SHCNs, (2) SHCNs and no SSI, or (3) SHCNs and receiving SSI. Housing instability was determined by positive endorsement of >=1 adverse circumstance: behind on rent or mortgage, or moving twice or more in the past year, or homelessness in the child's lifetime. Analyses used multivariable logistic regression models, adjusting for demographics and housing subsidies. RESULT(S): Of 14 188 children, 80% had no SHCNs, 16% had SHCNs and no SSI, and 4% had SHCNs and received SSI. Compared with the no-SHCNs group, the SHCNs-no-SSI group but not the SHCN-receiving-SSI group experienced significantly greater adjusted odds of being behind on rent or mortgage (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.28 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-1.44]; P < .001), multiple moves (aOR 1.29 [95% CI 1.05-1.59]; P = .01), and homelessness (aOR 1.44 [95% CI 1.20-1.72]; P < .001). CONCLUSION(S): Families of children with SHCNs are at risk for housing instability. Child SSI receipt decreased the risk of housing instability among families of children with SHCNs. Protecting families of young children with SHCNs from housing instability is an important investment.Copyright © 2019 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - Homeless youth become pregnant or involved in pregnancies at high rates. There are many ways by which unintended pregnancies may be prevented, including the use of condoms and other contraceptives. However, there is a dearth of research regarding contraceptive use among this vulnerable youth population, and especially through lenses that consider homeless youths' diverse gender identities, expressions, and sexualities. This study qualitatively explores homeless youths' attitudes and experiences regarding condom and other contraceptive use. Data were obtained from interviews with 30 youth experiencing homelessness, ages 18-21. Youth reported inconsistent use of condoms and other contraceptives, which youth often attributed to their perceptions of contraceptive inaccessibility and exorbitant cost. Most youth also did not know where to obtain contraceptive information and services, and reported transportation barriers and fear of being stigmatized in health care settings, particularly in relation to their gender identities and sexualities. Findings suggest that reproductive and sexual health information and services are urgently needed by all homeless young people, and from low-barrier, non-judgmental, and empathetic sources.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Food insecurity (FI) is a major public health problem in Lebanon, a small middle-income country with the highest refugee per capita concentration worldwide and prolonged political and economic challenges. The present study aimed to measure the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of household FI and to explore the association of household FI with anthropometric measures of children and their mothers. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey (2014-2015). SETTING: Lebanon.ParticipantsNationally representative sample of Lebanese households with 4-18-year-old-children and their mothers (n 1204). RESULT(S): FI prevalence (95 % CI), measured using the Arabic-translated, validated Household Food Insecurity Access Scale, was found to be 49.3 (44.0, 54.6) % in the study sample. Mild, moderate and severe FI were found in 7.0 (5.5, 9.2) %, 23.3 (20.1, 26.8) % and 18.9 (14.9, 23.5) % of households, respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that low maternal and paternal education, unemployment and crowding were significant correlates of household FI (P<0.05). No significant associations were observed between FI and anthropometric measures of children and their mothers, after adjusting for other socio-economic correlates. Food-insecure households reported various mechanisms to cope with food shortage, such as reducing the number of meals/d (49.6 %), borrowing food (54.4 %), spending savings (34.5 %) and withdrawing children from schools (8.0 %). CONCLUSION(S): FI exists among a remarkable proportion of Lebanese households with children. Correlates of household FI should be considered when designing social welfare policies and public health programmes to promote more sustainable, resilient and healthier livelihoods among vulnerable individuals.

N2  - While HIV disproportionately impacts homeless individuals, little is known about the prevalence of HIV risk behaviors in the southwest and how age factors and HIV risk perceptions influence sexual risk behaviors. We conducted a secondary data analysis (n = 460) on sexually active homeless adults from a cross-sectional study of participants (n = 610) recruited from homeless service locations, such as shelters and drop-in centers, in an understudied region of the southwest. Covariate-adjusted logistic regressions were used to assess the impact of age at homelessness onset, current age, age at first sex, and HIV risk perceptions on having condomless sex, new sexual partner(s), and multiple sexual partners (>=4 sexual partners) in the past 12 months. Individuals who first experienced homelessness by age 24 were significantly more likely to report condomless sex and multiple sexual partners in the past year than those who had a later onset of their first episode of homelessness. Individuals who were currently 24 years or younger were more likely to have had condomless sex, new sexual partners, and multiple sexual partners in the past 12 months than those who were 25 years or older. Those who had low perceived HIV risk had lower odds of all three sexual risk behaviors. Social service and healthcare providers should consider a younger age at homelessness onset when targeting HIV prevention services to youth experiencing homelessness.Copyright © 2018 by the authors.

N2  - Introduction Cigarette smoking is associated with many adverse health effects and is an important public health concern. Increased understanding of smokers' behavior is central to developing effective interventions. Cigarette scavenging, a behavior that involves smoking shared or previously used cigarettes has thus far only been shown to be prevalent among homeless or incarcerated populations. The current study examines whether cigarette scavenging is prevalent in a more general population of adult smokers enrolling in a smoking cessation clinical trial, and whether engagement in this behavior is associated with demographic or smoking-related psychosocial factors. Methods Baseline data was obtained from adult smokers (N = 227) enrolling in a randomized clinical trial for smoking cessation. Cigarette scavenging was assessed using three items: a) sharing a cigarette with a stranger; b) smoking a "found" cigarette and c) smoking a previously used cigarette "butt". Participants who endorsed engaging in at least one of these three behaviors were categorized as a scavenger. Results Approximately 32% of participants endorsed at least one cigarette scavenging behavior. A multiple logistic regression analysis found that scavengers were more likely to be: men (p < 0.001), of younger age at smoking onset (p = 0.012), unemployed (p = 0.003), more likely to have used marijuana in the past 30 days (p = 0.005), single or living alone (p = 0.003), and to have experienced higher withdrawal symptoms during previous quit attempts (p = 0.044) as compared to non-scavengers. Conclusions Scavenging is common among adult smokers. Interventions that address cigarette scavenging behaviors may better meet the needs of this unique smoking subgroup.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Background Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW, ages 15-24) are at high risk of HIV in Swaziland. Understanding more about their male sexual partners can inform HIV prevention efforts for both. Methods Using the PLACE methodology across all 19 DREAMS implementation districts, 843 men ages 20-34 were surveyed between December 2016-February 2017. Surveys were conducted at 182 venues identified by community informants as places where AGYW and men meet/socialize. Descriptive and multivariate analyses examined characteristics and risk behaviors of male partners of AGYW. Results Men's average age was 25.7. Sixty-three percent reported female partners ages 15-19, and 70% reported partners ages 20-24 in the last year; of those, 12% and 11% respectively had five or more such partners. Among the 568 male partners of AGYW, 36% reported consistent condom use with their current/last partner. Forty-two percent reported testing for HIV in the last year; 6% were HIV-positive, and of those, 97% were currently on treatment. Onethird (37%) reported being circumcised; among uncircumcised, 81% were not considering it. In multivariate analyses, men who reported three or more AGYW partners in the last year were more likely to be HIV-positive (aOR 3.2, 95% CI 1.1,8.8). Men were also less likely to disclose their HIV status to adolescent versus older partners (aOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4,0.9) and partners more than 5 years younger than themselves (aOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4,0.9). Results also revealed relatively high unemployment and mobility, substantial financial responsibilities, and periodic homelessness. Conclusions Most men identified through community venues reported relationships with AGYW, and these relationships demonstrated substantial HIV risk. Challenging life circumstances suggest structural factors may underlie some risk behaviors. Engaging men in HIV prevention and targeted health services is critical, and informant-identified community venues are promising intervention sites to reach high-risk male partners of AGYW.Copyright © 2018 Reynolds et al.

N2  - Objectives We compared the US-derived Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) home visiting programme when added to usually provided health and social care for first-time teenage mothers, to usual care alone. We aimed to: Establish the nature of usual care, measure service usage and assess performance bias in core usual care services. Design Within trial process evaluation. Local professionals completed a survey mapping local health and social care services in seven domains. This focused on services available to young women, especially those relevant to pregnant teenagers. Descriptive data were assessed thematically to establish the range of services. Quantitative data collection with FNP supervisors enumerated service provision by site. Services identified were included in main participant trial follow-up interviews at four time points to quantify usage. Usage was described descriptively by domain. We explored predictors of health visitor visits. Setting 18 partnerships of local authority and healthcare organisations in England. Outcomes Descriptive framework of services. Rates of service usage reported by trial participants. Results 161 separate services were identified, with multiple service models in each domain, broadly categorised as universal or specialist (eg, for teenage mothers). FNP supervisors identified 30-63 universal services per site and 22-67 specialist services. Use of core maternity care services was similar across trial arms and with only small differences in use of health visiting services. Participants accessed a wide range of services. Women who had ever been homeless, who had a higher subjectively defined social status, and poorer mental health received more visits from a health visitor. Conclusions The large number of services available to teenage mothers in England may limit the incremental benefit achievable through enhanced home visiting. There was little evidence of compensatory practice, such as additional care for women in the usual care arm. Measuring usual care when trialling complex interventions is challenging and essential.Copyright © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

N2  - Inadequate housing and homelessness among families represent a substantial challenge for child and adolescent well-being. Child welfare services confront housing that threatens placement into foster care with little resources and evidence to guide practice. The present study provides the first rigorous test of the Family Unification Program (FUP) - a federal program that offers housing subsidies for inadequately housed families under investigation for child maltreatment. A randomized controlled trial assesses program impact on foster care placement and costs. The experiment referred intact child welfare-involved families whose inadequate housing threatened foster placement in Chicago, IL to FUP plus housing advocacy (n = 89 families with 257 children) or housing advocacy alone (n = 89 families with 257 children). Families were referred from 2011 to 2013, and administrative data recorded dates and costs of foster placements over a 3-year follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses suggested families randomly assigned for FUP exhibited slower increases in rates of foster placement following housing intervention compared with families referred for housing advocacy alone. The program generates average savings of nearly $500 per family per year to the foster care system. Housing subsidies provide the foster care system small but significant benefits for keeping homeless families together. Findings inform the design of a coordinated child welfare response to housing insecurity.Copyright © 2018

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In 2012, Massachusetts changed its emergency shelter eligibility policy for homeless families. One new criterion to document homelessness was staying in a location "not meant for human habitation, " and the emergency department (ED) fulfilled this requirement. Our aim for this study is to analyze the frequency and costs of pediatric ED visits for homelessness before and after this policy. METHOD(S): This is a retrospective study of ED visits for homelessness at a children's hospital from March 2010 to February 2016. A natural language processing tool was used to identify cases, which were manually reviewed for inclusion. We compared demographic and homelessness circumstance characteristics and conducted an interrupted time series analysis to compare ED visits by homeless children before and after the policy. We compared the change in ED visits for homelessness to the number of homeless children in Massachusetts. We analyzed payment data for each visit. RESULT(S): There were 312 ED visits for homelessness; 95% (n = 297) of visits were after the policy. These visits increased 4.5 times after the policy (95% confidence interval: 1.33 to 15.23). Children seen after the policy were more likely to have no medical complaint (rate ratio: 3.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.18 to 9.01). Although the number of homeless children in Massachusetts increased 1.4 times over the study period, ED visits for homelessness increased 13-fold. Payments (average: $557 per visit) were >4 times what a night in a shelter would cost; 89% of payments were made through state-based insurance plans. CONCLUSION(S): A policy change to Massachusetts' shelter eligibility was associated with increased pediatric ED visits for homelessness along with substantial health care costs.Copyright © 2018 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Managed alcohol programs (MAP) aim to reduce harms experienced by unstably housed individuals with alcohol use disorders by providing regulated access to beverage alcohol, usually alongside housing, meals and other supports. This study compares two methods of estimating participants' outside alcohol consumption in order to inform program policies and practices around alcohol dosing and reducing risks of alcohol-related illnesses. METHOD(S): The total alcohol consumption of 65 people participating in Canadian MAPs was assessed comparing daily MAP records (1903 client days) with researcher-administered surveys over the same time period. A sub-sample of more complete daily MAP records for 39 people (696 client days) was also compared with the equivalent survey data on drinking. RESULT(S): Significantly more standard drinks per day (SDs, one SD=17.05mL ethanol) were reported in research interviews than recorded by program staff, whether for program administered drinks alone (means 16.04 vs. 8.32 SDs, t=5.79, P<0.001) or including outside-program drinks as reported to staff (16.04 vs. 8.89 SDs, t=5.37, P<0.001). Consistent results were found in the sub-sample. The number of outside drinks estimated by comparing program records with the research interviews, varied between 2.71 and 9.94 mean drinks per day per site. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION(S): At two sites, MAP participants reported consuming more than twice the amount of alcohol administered on the program. At most sites, there was significant under-reporting of outside drinking. Addressing the problem of outside drinking and total daily consumption is critical for achieving program goals of both short and long-term harm reduction.Copyright © 2017 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Kids Cafe Program (KCP) nutrition education and assess its impact on children's diet quality and body mass index (BMI) percentile. DESIGN: An experimental design consisting of pretest-posttest comparison groups using mixed methods to evaluate a 6-session nutrition education intervention. SETTING: Four Boys and Girls Club sites PARTICIPANTS: A total of 120 9- to 12-year-old children in the KCP (60 intervention and 60 comparison); 89% completed posttest evaluations. INTERVENTION: Trained KCP site staff taught the nutrition education curriculum at intervention sites. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Healthy Eating Index-2010 using 24-hour dietary recall data (primary) and BMI percentile (secondary) ANALYSIS: Repeated-measures mixed-effects modeling RESULTS: Mean age of children was 10.2 years; mean BMI percentile was about 79; 95% were from food-insecure households. The total Healthy Eating Index-2010 score for both groups at baseline and posttest ranged from 50 to 60. At posttest, compared with baseline scores, children from both groups scored significantly lower for total vegetables, and greens and beans; the intervention group children had significantly higher sodium scores. Process evaluation indicated that 60-minute lecture-based sessions were too long after children were in school all day. CONCLUSION(S): This pilot study suggests that the KCP nutrition education curriculum needs improvement. Further research based on behavioral constructs is needed to refine the curriculum to encourage healthier food choices among children and using the MyPlate and the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.Copyright © 2017 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior.

N2  - We employ a social stress framework, which examines the influence of multiple stressors (e.g., physical abuse, foster care placement) on an individual's ability to function (e.g., mental well-being), to longitudinally examine the effects of stressful life events on mental health and the role of the social environment in this process among 150 homeless youth. Results revealed that numerous stressors, such as physical abuse and running away from home more frequently, were associated with greater depressive symptoms and elevated anxiety. Having mentors and family and friends from home that youth can rely on resulted in more positive social support, which subsequently lowered the risk for depressive symptoms and anxiety at wave 2.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

N2  - Physical inactivity is estimated to be the fourth leading cause of global mortality. Strategies to increase physical activity (PA) increasingly emphasize environmental and policy changes including the modification of neighborhood environments to promote walking and other forms of healthy activity. Open Streets (OS) initiatives, an important and growing strategy to modify neighborhood environments for PA, create temporary parks for recreational activity by closing streets to motor vehicle traffic, thereby offering health and community building benefits. We used the Stanford Neighborhood Discovery Tool (DT)-photo/voice software on a tablet-to train neighborhood residents to act as "citizen scientist" observers of the local built environment on a non-event day and during an OS initiative. The purposes of this project were as follows: (1) to assess adult residents' perceptions of neighborhood characteristics of the OS initiative in three socioeconomically diverse sites and (2) to test the DT for use in three international urban settings with OS initiatives; Bogota, Colombia; San Francisco, USA; and Temuco, Chile, among a multigenerational, multiethnic sample of adults including, for the first time, a vulnerable population of homeless adults (Bogota). Using the DT, participants walked an OS route taking photos and recording reasons for the photos, then completed a 25-item demographic/environmental observation survey and a 16-item Reflection Survey on perceived environmental changes. A total of 18 themes were reported by participants with areas of overlapping themes (e.g., Community and Social Connectedness) and areas where a single site reported a theme (e.g., Social Isolation in Older Adults). Ten of the 18 themes were identified by at least two sites including "Bike Resources" and "Services", indicating the value of programming at OS initiatives. The themes of "Festive Environment" and "Family Friendly Environment" reflect the quality of the overall environment for participants. Four themes (Community and Social Connectedness, Family Friendly Environment, PA, and Safety) were reported by all sites. Three of the four unifying themes were also ranked among the highest reported categories of "seemed better" on the Reflection Survey (Ease of Walking, Overall Safety of Neighborhood, and Friendliness of Environment), providing additional confirmation of the shared experience of social, health, and psychological benefits from OS initiatives. OS initiatives offer a global strategy for increasing neighborhood opportunities for PA and a potential site for training citizen scientists to document environmental influences on PA.

N2  - Homeless youth frequently experience victimization, and youth with histories of trauma often fail to detect danger risks, making them vulnerable to subsequent victimization. The current study describes a pilot test of a skills-based intervention designed to improve risk detection among homeless youth through focusing attention to internal, interpersonal, and environmental cues. Youth aged 18 to 21 years ( N = 74) were recruited from a shelter and randomly assigned to receive usual case management services or usual services plus a 3-day manualized risk detection intervention. Pretest and posttest interviews assessed youths' risk detection abilities through vignettes describing risky situations and asking youth to identify risk cues present. Separate 2 (intervention vs. control) x 2 (pretest vs. posttest) mixed ANOVAs found significant interaction effects, as intervention youth significantly improved in overall risk detection compared with control youth. Post hoc subgroup analyses found the intervention had a greater effect for youth without previous experiences of indirect victimization than those with previous indirect victimization experiences.

N2  - Abstract: Poor adherence to antipsychotics, which affects outcome, is frequent in first episode psychosis (FEP). Most randomized studies demonstrate no superiority of long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAI-AP) over oral antipsychotics (OAP). However, participants in these studies represent a minority of patients who may benefit from LAI-AP. Mirror and naturalistic studies generally demonstrate efficacy of LAI-AP on more representative samples, but studies on FEP are scarce. Aim(s): To describe LAI-AP's utilization and impact on FEP outcome in a naturalistic setting. Method(s): A 3-year longitudinal prospective and retrospective descriptive study of all consecutive admissions from two Early Intervention Services for psychosis (EIS) in Montreal, Canada, compared the characteristics and evolution of patients who received LAI-AP for at least 12 months to those who received OAP only. Result(s): From 375 FEP patients included, 26,7% received LAI-AP during their follow-up. They were more likely to have poor prognostic factors (male gender, lower premorbid functioning, homelessness, substance use disorder and schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses). Despite a more severe illness and lower functioning in the LAI-AP group, at admission and study endpoint, clinical and functional improvements were observed. Conclusion(s): Early prescription of LAI-AP seems beneficial in FEP with poor prognostic factors.

T1  - The Effect of a Resilience Enhancement Programme for Female Runaway Youths: A Quasi-Experimental Study
A1  - Noh D. 
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - The effects of a resilience enhancement programme on resilience, depression, anxiety, and problem drinking among female runaway youths living in shelters were evaluated. Participants were 32 youths (16 experimental and 16 control participants), assessed at pre-test, post-test, and one-month follow-up. The programme incorporated five protective factors associated with resilience: self-esteem, self-regulation, relational skills, problem-solving skills, and goal-setting skills. There were significant group-by-time interaction effects for resilience, anxiety, and problem drinking at one-month follow-up. The preliminary results suggest that providing female runaway youths with this programme focusing on protective factors may enhance resilience and mitigate anxiety, and problem drinking.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a combined strategy of human papillomavirus virus (HPV) vaccination and high-risk HPV screening to reduce the occurrence of anogenital and oropharyngeal neoplasms among men who have sex with men, people with HIV, homeless people, transgender women, female sex workers and rape victims. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This mixed methods study evaluates the effectiveness of a combined vaccination-screening strategy to reduce HPV prevalence/incidence and occurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasms grade 2+ and/or anal intraepithelial neoplasms grade 2+, using Kaplan-Meier. The time-to-event method will evaluate time from positive results for specific anogenital HPV to incidence of anogenital lesions containing that HPV type. RESULT(S): People vaccinated against HPV and screened for HPV as a primary test will have lower prevalence and incidence of HPV infection and consequently lower frequency of HPV-related anogenital and oropharyngeal lesions. CONCLUSION(S): Thisstudy will generate scientific evidence on effectiveness of a combined vaccination-screening strategy to reduce the burden of HPV-associated neoplasms.

N2  - It is unknown whether providing housing to persons experiencing homelessness decreases HIV risk. Housing, including access to preventive services and counseling, might provide a period of transition for persons with HIV risk factors. We assessed whether the new HIV diagnosis rate was associated with duration of supportive housing. We linked data from a cohort of 21,689 persons without a previous HIV diagnosis who applied to a supportive housing program in New York City (NYC) during 2007-2013 to the NYC HIV surveillance registry. We used time-dependent Cox modeling to compare new HIV diagnoses among recipients of supportive housing (defined a priori, for program evaluation purposes, as persons who spent >7 days in supportive housing; n = 6447) and unplaced applicants (remainder of cohort), after balancing the groups on baseline characteristics with propensity score weights. Compared with unplaced applicants, persons who received >=3 continuous years of supportive housing had decreased risk for new HIV diagnosis (HR 0.10; CI 0.01-0.99). Risk of new HIV diagnosis decreased with longer duration placement in supportive housing. Supportive housing might aid in primary HIV prevention.

N2  - Data from two studies of transgender women in Los Angeles County that used the same methodology and survey assessment (Study 1: 1998-1999, N=244; Study 2: 2015-2016, N=271), compared structural determinants of health, HIV/STI prevalence, HIV risk behaviors, substance use, gender confirmation procedures, and perceived discrimination and harassment/abuse across a 17-year time period. Findings demonstrated that participants in the latter study reported significantly higher access to healthcare insurance and prescription hormones. However, participants in the latter study also reported lower levels of income; and, elevated prevalence of homelessness, HIV and lifetime STIs, receptive condomless anal intercourse with casual partner(s), and reported physical harassment/abuse. Given the timeframe of these results, these findings elucidate specific areas of transgender women's health and risk profiles that improved or worsened across 17 years. While healthcare access has improved, transgender women continue to face significant barriers to good health, indicating the need for increased attention to this population.

N2  - Background: Homelessness is associated with increased mortality, morbidity and social difficulties and periods of homelessness are sometimes prolonged or repeated. However, there are no long-term follow-up studies focusing upon housing status among homeless people. The aim of this study was to examine morbidity and housing outcomes and to identify factors predicting being independently housed 10 years after shelter use. Method(s): By combining data from several registers we followed all 552 homeless men who stayed in shelter in Helsinki during 2004 and determined their housing situation and morbidity 10 years later. Their situation was compared with an age-matched control group from the general population (N = 946). Using logistic regression analysis, we assessed the predictive effects of socioeconomic factors and health service use at baseline on becoming independently housed. Result(s): By the end of the follow-up 52.0% of the formerly homeless study group had died, compared with 14.6% of the controls. At 10 years, 6.0% were independently housed, 37.5% lived in supported housing and 4.5% were still or again homeless. Psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorder, were present in 77.5% of the homeless, compared with 16.1% among the controls. Being married (OR 8.3, 95% CI 3.0 to 23.2) and having less than four shelter nights in year 2004 (OR 9.1, 95% CI 2.7 to 30.8) strongly predicted being independently housed 10 years later. Conclusion(s): Homeless staying in shelters have high mortality and morbidity and most of those surviving, are in need of support in their everyday lives even years after the shelter period.

N2  - The purpose of this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to compare the 6-month outcomes of a Dialectical Behavioral Therapy-Corrections Modified (DBT-CM) program versus a Health Promotion (HP) program on mitigating recidivism among 130 female parolees/probationers between baseline and 6-month follow-up. The effect of DBT-CM on reducing recidivism was greater among those who expressed a desire for help (risk ratio [RR] = 0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.16, 1.00]; p = .050) and among homeless female ex-offenders (HFOs) who were younger (<50 years of age; RR = 0.46; 95% CI = [0.19, 1.11]; p = .085) and participants with Desire for Help score > 35 (Model 3; RR = 0.40; 95% CI = [0.16, 1.00]; p = .050). Findings from this pilot study suggest that the DBT-CM intervention may be effective in reducing reincarceration rates among some HFOs during reentry. Larger RCTs are needed to validate our findings.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nonmedical prescription opioid (NMPO) use is a problem among young adults, yet young NMPO users are a diverse population that has been challenging to engage in overdose prevention and harm reduction programs. OBJECTIVE(S): This study compared the effectiveness and characteristics of persons recruited through two different sampling strategies to inform research and intervention efforts with young adult NMPO users. METHOD(S): We analyzed data from the Rhode Island Young Adult Prescription Drug Study (RAPiDS), which enrolled persons aged 18 to 29 who reported past 30-day NMPO use. We compared the characteristics of two samples recruited simultaneously between February 2015 and February 2016. One sample was recruited using field-based strategies (e.g., respondent-driven sampling, transit ads), and a second from internet sources (e.g., online classifieds). RESULT(S): Among 198 eligible participants, the median age was 25 (IQR: 22, 27), 130 (65.7%) were male, 123 (63.1%) were white, and 150 (78.1%) resided in urban areas. A total of 79 (39.9%) were recruited using field-based strategies and 119 (60.1%) were recruited from internet sources. Internet-recruited persons were younger (median = 24 [IQR: 21, 27] vs. 26 [IQR: 23, 28] years) and more likely to reside in rural areas (16.2% vs. 5.3%), although this finding was marginally significant. Field-recruited participants were more likely to have been homeless (36.7% vs. 17.7%), have been incarcerated (39.7% vs. 21.8%), and engage in daily NMPO use (34.6% vs. 14.5%). CONCLUSION(S): Multipronged outreach methods are needed to engage the full spectrum of young adult NMPO users in prevention and harm reduction efforts.

N2  - Research indicates that dispositional attachment security fosters empathy, and that short-term increases in security ("security priming") increase empathy and willingness to help others. In two experiments, we examined effects of recalling one's own vulnerability ( feeling hurt by a relationship partner) and security priming on empathy for a recipient in need. In Study 1, the recipient was a middle-aged homeless woman (low similarity to participants); in Study 2, the recipient was a college-aged woman whose boyfriend had been unfaithful (high similarity to participants). In both studies, hurt feelings influenced participants' empathy, but the nature of the influence varied as a function of target-participant similarity. In Study 1, hurt feelings decreased empathy and increased caregiving avoidance. In Study 2, hurt feelings not only increased empathy but also aroused caregiving anxiety. Furthermore, security priming weakened defensive barriers against helping: In Study 1, it reduced caregiving avoidance, and in Study 2, it reduced caregiving anxiety.

N2  - Psychiatric patients are at increased risk of adverse life events, such as being incarcerated and homelessness in their life course. Using data from a cross-sectional multicenter study of 2,475 patients selected from 26 mental health services in Brazil, we examined the association of sociodemographic, clinical, behavioral, and adverse life characteristics with history of homelessness, incarceration or their co-occurrence during lifetime. Odds ratios were obtained by multinomial logistic regression models. The prevalence of homelessness, incarceration and co-occurrence of these two conditions were 8.6%, 16.4%, and 9.4%, respectively. Lower income, living in unstable condition, intellectual disability, and cigarette smoking were associated with homelessness. Being male, lower schooling, sex under effect of alcohol or drugs, and multiple sex partners were associated with incarceration. Psychiatric hospitalizations, substance use, and history of sexually transmitted diseases, and sexual, physical, or verbal violence were associated with co-occurrence of both conditions. Our findings suggest that incarceration and homelessness are very prevalent and correlated in psychiatric patients in Brazil. Many of the associated factors are potentially modifiable, and may act synergistically requiring integrated care.

N2  - Objective: Since the publication of the DSM-5 (APA, 2013), the dimensional conception of the personality disorders is co-existing with the classical categorical paradigm. Tools have been proposed for the evaluations of five big pathological factors to be explored further according to the APA (negative affectivity, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, psychoticism). Despite numerous works using these questionnaires (30 works in 3 years according to Al-Adjani et al., 2015), none of them have yet been translated into French. Also, the main objective of the paper is to present a French translation of the Personality Inventory for DSM -5 by Kruegger et al. (2013) in its brief form of 25 items (PID-5 BF). Method(s): To reach this goal, we have employed the classic translation-retranslation method (Vallerand, 1989) and tested the consistence and the validity of this French version among a non-clinical sample (n = 216) of young adults (age = 31.4, SD = 4.8), in joining some other questionnaires in their short forms to study the external validity of the PID-5 about the psychological distress (SCL-10, Nguyen, 1983), the categorical diagnosis of personality disorders (SAPAS, Moran et al., 2003) and the classical Big Five dimensions of the personality (BDI 10, Ramamstedt and John, 2007). The internal consistency of this translation has been studied through the classical outcomes on factor analysis for the dimensional repartitions of the items in 5 scales and Cronbach's alpha for the consistency of each found dimensions. The external validity has been explored by studying Pearson's correlations between the outcomes on each dimension of the PID-5 BF and both the clinical dimensions of SCL-10, personality dimensions of the BFI-10 or personality disorders (SAPAS). Result(s): Factor analysis led to the same repartition of the 25 items as the original versions. Each of the dimensions is consistent enough (alpha >.65) to be taken into account as clinically significant. The items of the French version of the PID-5 BF follow the expected repartitions in 5 dimensions, which are consistent enough. Although their mean scores are significantly not different from the outcomes found by Krueger with the PID-5 200 items among another non-clinical population (n = 264), one cannot say that is enough to ensure the external validity of our translation, for it uses neither the same tools nor sample. A comparison with a French translation of the PID-5 would be more significant. However, the external validity of the French version seems to be significant enough. Global score on the PID-5 is correlated both to the Global Severity Index of the SCL-10, which reflects global psychological distress, and SAPAS's score, which evaluates the suspicion of personality disorder. The clinical validity of the PID-5 is confirmed by the relationships between negative affectivity and anxiety or depression or antagonism and hostility, although the clinical scale of the SCL-10, with one item by dimension, is less sensitive than the complete original version in 90 items (DeRogatis, 1974). PID-5 score and domains are also correlated with the Big Five personality dimension and global score of personality disorders which led us to think that it is coherent with the evaluation of personality suffering (r =.34) and dimensions. The links between negative affectivity and neurosism (r =.48) or between desinhibition and extraversion (r =.32) or the negative correlation between psychoticism and conscientiousness (r = -0.16) are consistent with the expectations related both to the descriptions of the domains by the DSM and outcomes on the comparisons between PID-5 200 item scales and NEO-PI or BFI 45 items. Discussion(s): This translation offers enough consistency and validity to be used in future studies. This could lead us to either continue studying a more representative general population or testing its validity in focusing on a clinical sample where personality disorders are prevalent, such as homeless men or substance users. As soon as a French version of the PID-5 200 items is published, one can compare the outcomes on PID-5 BF and PID-5 to lead to estimations of personality disorders and pathological domains among French populations and explore personality disorders throughout a dimensional paradigm instead of syndromic perspective. One can also see whether the items that have been kept for each dimension are as saturated in the French version as in the original one. Among general populations, comparisons with clinical distress, syndromic personality disorders or dimensional aspect of personality could be done with complete versions of PID-5, Symptom Check-list, Personality Disorders Questionnaires or Big Five Inventory; therefore, the brief forms of any questionnaire could be used among any people whose psychological distress or side effects impaired their attention and concentration.Copyright © 2016 L'Encephale, Paris

N2  - Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) are designed to enrich maternal and child diets with the objective of preventing undernutrition during the first 1,000 days. Scaling up the delivery of supplements such as SQ-LNS hinges on understanding private demand and creatively leveraging policy-relevant factors that might influence demand. We used longitudinal stated willingness-to-pay (WTP) data from contingent valuation studies that were integrated into randomized controlled nutrition trials in Ghana and Malawi to estimate private valuation of SQ-LNS during pregnancy, postpartum, and early childhood. We found that average stated WTP for a day's supply of SQ-LNS was more than twice as high in Ghana than Malawi, indicating that demand for SQ-LNS (and by extension, the options for effective delivery of SQ-LNS) may be very context specific. We also examined factors associated with WTP, including intervention group, household socioeconomic status, birth outcomes, child growth, and maternal and child morbidity. In both sites, WTP was consistently negatively associated with household food insecurity, indicating that subsidization might be needed to permit food insecure households to acquire SQ-LNS if it is made available for purchase. In Ghana, WTP was higher among heads of household than among mothers, which may be related to control over household resources. Personal experience using SQ-LNS was not associated with WTP in either site.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Maternal and Child Nutrition published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Training rats in a complex olfactory discrimination task results in acquisition of "rule learning" (learning how to learn), a term describing the capability to perform the task superbly. Such rule learning results in strengthening of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections between neurons in the piriform cortex. Moreover, intrinsic excitability is also enhanced throughout the pyramidal neuron population. Surprisingly, the cortical network retains its stability under these long-term modifications. In particular, the susceptibility for long-term potentiation (LTP) induction, while decreased for a short time window, returns to almost its pretraining value, although significant strengthening of AMPA receptor-mediated glutamatergic transmission remains. Such network balance is essential for maintaining the single-cell modifications that underlie long-term memory while preventing hyperexcitability that would result in runaway synaptic activity. However, the mechanisms underlying the long-term maintenance of such balance have yet to be described. In this study, we explored the role of astrocyte-mediated gliotransmission in long-term maintenance of learning-induced modifications in susceptibility for LTP induction and control of the strength of synaptic inhibition. We show that blocking connexin 43 hemichannels, which form gap junctions between astrocytes, decreases significantly the ability to induce LTP by stimulating the excitatory connections between piriform cortex pyramidal neurons after learning only. In parallel, spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitude is reduced in neurons from trained rats only, to the level of prelearning. Thus gliotransmission has a key role in maintaining learning-induced cortical stability by a wide-ranged control on synaptic transmission and plasticity. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We explore the role of astrocyte-mediated gliotransmission in maintenance of olfactory discrimination learning-induced modifications.

N2  - This article presents findings of a pilot test of a Motivational Interviewing social network intervention (MI-SNI) to enhance motivation to reduce high risk alcohol and other drug (AOD) use among formerly homeless individuals transitioning to housing. Delivered in-person by a facilitator trained in MI, this four-session computer-assisted intervention provides personalized social network visualization feedback to help participants understand the people in their network who trigger their alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and those who support abstinence. If ready, participants are encouraged to make changes to their social network to help reduce their own high-risk behavior. Participants were 41 individuals (33 male, 7 female, 1 other; 23 African-American, 5 non-Latino White, 6 Latino, 7 other, mean age 48) who were transitioning from homelessness to permanent supportive housing. They were randomly assigned to either the MI-SNI condition or usual care. Readiness to change AOD use, AOD abstinence self-efficacy, and AOD use were assessed at baseline and shortly after the final intervention session for the MI-SNI arm and around 3-months after baseline for the control arm. Acceptability of the intervention was also evaluated. MI-SNI participants reported increased readiness to change AOD use compared to control participants. We also conducted a subsample analysis for participants at one housing program and found a significant intervention effect on readiness to change AOD use, AOD abstinence self-efficacy, and alcohol use compared to control participants. Participants rated the intervention as highly acceptable. We conclude that a brief computer-assisted Motivational Interviewing social network intervention has potential to efficaciously impact readiness to change AOD use, AOD abstinence self-efficacy, and AOD use among formerly homeless individuals transitioning to permanent supportive housing, and warrants future study in larger clinical trials.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Addressing stigma remains a pressing HIV priority globally. Young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM, ages 18-30; N = 474) completed an in-person baseline survey and reported their experiences of externalized stigma (i.e., racial and sexuality discrimination), internalized stigma (i.e., homonegativity), social support, and psychological distress (i.e., anxiety and depression symptoms). We used structural equation modeling to test the association between stigma and psychological distress, and examined whether social support mediated the relationship between stigma and psychological distress. Recognizing that these associations may differ by HIV status, we compared our models by self-reported HIV status (n = 275 HIV negative/unknown; n = 199 living with HIV). Our findings suggest that YBMSM who experience stigma are more vulnerable to psychological distress and may have diminished buffering through social support. These effects are accentuated among YBMSM living with HIV, highlighting the need for additional research focused on the development of tailored stigma reduction interventions for YBMSM.Copyright © 2018 The Guilford Press.

N2  - Socioeconomic status (SES) is known to have a considerable influence on the development of neuropsychological functions. In particular there is strong evidence for less efficient development of prefrontal-cortex-related functions in children raised in low-SES households. "Street children" are a common feature of low SES in many low- and middle-income countries, and some researchers have suggested that the unique life experiences of street children may drive their neurocognitive development. This study compares a group of 36 former street children in Quito, Ecuador with a control group of 26 never street-connected schoolchildren. All children were assessed with a range of neuropsychological tests. Although the street children group performed significantly below the level of the control group on all measures, they did not demonstrate a generalized lower ability. By controlling the effects of fluid intelligence it was found that there are relatively independent effects on visuospatial ability and executive planning ability. Furthermore, the executive function test scores in general are significantly less affected than the other cognitive functions and may be temporary effects caused by recent substance abuse within the street child sample. The findings generally support results from other countries suggesting that low SES is associated with negative effects on neuropsychological development. However, they also suggest that the local social and economic context, such as in the case of street children, might mitigate the harmful effects of low SES on the development of some executive functions.Copyright © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

T1  - Substance Use and Social Stability of Homeless Youth: A Comparison of Three Interventions
A1  - Zhang J.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - The current study identified subgroups of homeless youth and young adults that exhibited distinct co-occurring patterns of substance use and social stability (e.g., employment, school attendance, and housing), and evaluated the relative effectiveness of the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA), Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), and case management (CM) in interrupting substance use and improving social stability. The differentiating effects of personal characteristics on the co-occurrence of substance use and social stability were also examined. Participants included 270 homeless youth and young adults who were randomly assigned to one of the three intervention conditions: CRA, n 93, MET, n 86, or CM, n 91. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months postbaseline. A dual trajectory latent class growth analysis identified four co-occurring patterns: low-stable substance use paired with low-increasing social stability, high-stable substance use paired with low-stable social stability, high-declining substance use paired with low-increasing social stability, and low-increasing substance use paired with high-stable social stability. Findings showed that CRA was superior in improving substance use and social stability simultaneously compared to MET and CM, and further, CM was more effective than MET. Personal factors including race, age, coping strategies, and behavior problems differentiated the co-occurring patterns of substance use and social stability. The findings underscore the significance in identifying subgroups of homeless youth that vary in problem severity in terms of their substance use and social stability, and offer evidence to help practitioners identify the most effective intervention that responds to the needs of homeless youth.Copyright © 2018 American Psychological Association.

N2  - Background: While the overall incidence of hepatitis A has declined markedly since the introduction of a vaccine, sporadic cases and outbreaks of the disease continue to occur. Objective(s): Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of an electronic health record (EHR) provider alert as part of an outbreak-control vaccination program implemented in the emergency department (ED). Method(s): We conducted a retrospective study assessing the impact of a Best Practice Alert (BPA) built into an EHR to prompt providers when a patient was homeless to consider hepatitis A vaccination in the ED. Data were collected over three 6-month time periods: a historical control period, a pre-intervention period, and an intervention period. Result(s): There were no vaccinations given in the ED in the historical period, which increased to 465 after the implementation of the BPA. During the implementation period, there were 1,482 visits identified among 1,131 patients that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, there were 1,147 (77.5%) visits where the patient either received the vaccine in the ED, had already received the vaccine, or it was not indicated due to the current medical issue. There were also 333 (22.5%) visits where the BPA was active for potential vaccination eligibility, but did not receive it in the ED. Conclusion(s): We leveraged an informatics tool developed within our EHR to identify high-risk patients and remind providers of the availability of vaccination in the ED. Using these tools enabled providers to increase vaccination efforts within our ED to help control the community-wide outbreak.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - A comparison of risk factors for various forms of trauma in the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and heterosexual homeless youth
A1  - Tyler K.A.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Numerous homeless youth experience trauma prior to leaving home and while on the street. Bullying and trading sex (i.e. exchanging sexual favors for survival items such as food) are additional forms of trauma experienced by many homeless youth. Although lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) homeless youth experience higher rates of child abuse compared to their heterosexual counterparts, there is a paucity of research comparing these two groups. As such, we compare whether difficulties finding items of necessity (e.g. food) and different forms of trauma including child sexual abuse, being bullied, trading sex, and street sexual victimization significantly differ for LGB and heterosexual homeless youth. Bivariate results reveal that LGB youth have more trouble finding shelter and are more likely to trade sex compared to heterosexual youth. Logistic regression results show that trading sex is correlated with street sexual victimization. In the second model, we find that being female, experiencing more child sexual abuse, and ever having traded sex are all positively linked with street sexual victimization. LGB youth are over-represented among homeless youth populations and are also more likely to trade sex; therefore, these young people need services that are widely accessible and specific to their needs.Copyright © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

Method(s): Thirteen databases covering academic and gray literature were searched for published reviews and randomised controlled trials, and gray literature (2005-2016) and the results quality-assessed to prioritise best available evidence. We aimed to identify well-conducted systematic reviews and trials that evaluated individual-level interventions, for mental health/well-being outcomes, where the population was adolescents aged 10-24 years in any of 12 vulnerable groups at high risk of poor health outcomes (e.g. homeless, offenders, 'looked after' carers). Result(s): Thirty systematic reviews and 16 additional trials were identified. There was insufficient evidence to identify promising individual-level interventions that improve the mental health/well-being of any of the vulnerable groups. Conclusion(s): Despite Western policy to promote health and well-being among vulnerable young people, the dearth of evidence suggests a lack of interest in evaluating interventions targeting these groups in respect of their mental health/well-being outcomes.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s)

N2  - What housing and service interventions work best to reduce homelessness for families in the United States? The Family Options Study randomly assigned 2,282 families recruited in homeless shelters across 12 sites to priority access to one of three active interventions or to usual care in their communities. The interventions were long-term rent subsidies, short-term rent subsidies, and transitional housing in supervised programs with intensive psychosocial services. In two waves of follow-up data collected 20and 37 months later, priority access to long-term rent subsidies reduced homelessness sand food insecurity and improved other aspects of adult and child well-being relative to usual care, at a cost 9 percent higher. The other interventions had little effect. The study provides support for the view that homelessness for most families is an economic problem that long-term rent subsidies resolve and does not support the view that families must address psychosocial problems to succeed in housing. It has implications for focusing government resources on this important social problem.

N2  - In recent years, there has been a growing concern regarding populations of cats who are homeless. Shelters are constantly overwhelmed by the influx of cats without caregivers and are seeking solutions to enhance positive outcomes for them. In 2014, the Guelph Humane Society implemented a population management program to expedite the movement of cats through the shelter by decreasing the average nonhuman animal's length of stay using scheduled intakes to control for overcrowding and by implementing strategies to increase adoption rates. This study investigated the time trends in admission rates of cats to the Guelph Humane Society to assess the effectiveness of a population management program called Capacity for Care using a generalized linear autoregressive moving average model. From January 2011 to December 2015, a total of 3295 live cats were admitted to the Guelph Humane Society. When the analysis was adjusted to account for admissions of kittens, there was a significant reduction in admissions for adult cats (p <.01) following the introduction of the population management program. The results also showed a strong seasonal peak in total admissions during the summer months.Copyright © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Background: Food insecurity is defined as limited or uncertain access to nutritious food. The effects of food insecurity are detrimental for all, but especially for children given its vast and long-term consequences. Up to 16 million (21%) of US children are affected, and California is ranked 19th in the nation with a child food insecurity rate of 12.5%. Identifying these individuals and intervening expeditiously is crucial as children of food-insecure households are lacking more than just food: they are more likely to become ill, iron deficient, and obese. They are at risk for developmental delay and behavioral/psychiatric problems. These childhood ailments can all lead to chronic disease, mental health and job difficulties in adulthood. Despite the importance of screening our patients for food insecurity, our resident clinic has had low rates of screening (See Figure 1 for identified barriers to screening). Method(s): The goal of this Quality Improvement project is to increase the rate of food security screening during well child visits at resident clinic to 90% by the end of the 2016-2017 academic year. Through retrospective chart review, percent of visits screened were measured prior to intervention (control), and after several iterative intervention modalities (1-email/in-person reminders, 2-flyers of the screening questions, 3-placement of visual reminders). Data was trended following interventions to evaluate for improvement in screening. Result(s): The percent of documented screens performed were variable, as demonstrated by the two weeks of control data: 44% and 9%, respectively. This variability in data persisted following interventions 1 and 2, ranging from 18% to 64% screens per week. The data obtained after intervention 3 showed increased consistency, with approximately 55-60% of documented food security screening over three consecutive weeks (See Figure 2). Discussion(s): Screening at baseline and post-interventions 1 and 2 were quite inconsistent, suggesting that time and synthesis of knowledge into workflow were contributory. Improved consistency of screening post-intervention 3 was likely multifactorial: utilization of a revised template progress note that includes the food security screen and for the subset of residents who chose to use their own note templates, effective visual reminders to screen. The apparent success of intervention 3 seems less likely due to a cumulative effect as progressive improvement was not seen previously. This methodology of iterative interventions will continue until at least 90% of resident well child visits consistently include food security screening. The next intervention will focus on the education of residents on local applicability, communication with families, and available resources. These training sessions will be fundamentally based on the recent toolkit released by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Barriers to full compliance with screening by residents may include short time of visit and adherence in other screening items.

N2  - Purpose: Family homelessness in the U.S. is a growing problem, with one in thirty children homeless annually. Massachusetts is the only "right to shelter" state in the U.S., where eligible families cannot be denied placement. In December 2012, a policy was implemented which requires families to prove risk of homelessness by spending a night in a place "not fit for human habitation," including the emergency department (ED), to qualify for emergency assistance shelter. The aim of this study is to analyze the frequency and costs of ED visits by homeless children presenting for homelessness, before and after this policy. Method(s): This is a retrospective cohort study of ED visits to an urban children's hospital by homeless children from March 2010 to February 2016. We included all children 0-18 years old for whom homelessness was a presenting complaint or affected disposition. We excluded children already housed in a homeless shelter at the time of the ED visit. A natural language processing tool was used to identify cases by searching for key terms in the electronic medical records. Identified records were manually reviewed to determine if they met inclusion/exclusion criteria. We calculated frequencies of visits and demographics. We conducted an interrupted time series analysis to compare rates of homeless children per 1,000 ED visits before and after implementation of the policy in December 2012. We reviewed payment data for each record as a measure of cost to the healthcare system. Result(s): During the study period there were 312 ED visits for homelessness; 94% were after the 2012 policy (Figure 1). The median age was 3.2 years. The overall rate of visits for homelessness per month increased over 6 times from the pre- to the post-policy period (IRR 6.5, 95% CI 2.10, 20.24) (Figure 2). This increase is not explained by an increase in homeless children in Massachusetts or in general ED volume. Sixty-five percent of children after 2012 had no medical complaint, compared to 32% before 2012 (IRR 2.06, 95% CI 1.06, 4.02). The median ED length of stay increased from 6 hours (range 3-17) to 13 hours (range 1-97) between the pre- and post- period. These visits cost $173,950 (inflation adjusted to 2016 dollars): $17,264 before the policy and $156,686 afterwards. Ninety percent of payments ($156,062) were by state-based insurance plans. These costs averaged $566 per ED visit, nearly 5 times more than a night in emergency shelter. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest a policy changing Massachusetts' emergency assistance shelter eligibility increased the number of children presenting to the ED for homelessness, with substantial associated costs to the healthcare system. The cost of this allocation of healthcare resources should be taken into account when evaluating policies to address and alleviate family homelessness.

N2  - Background The demand for Global Health (GH) experiences in pediatric residencies has grown dramatically. These experiences do not need to be limited to international settings. Through the required advocacy training in residency, many residents have experiences with underserved populations similar to populations in GH settings. In addition, there are various GH experiences within the local communities. Two separate institutions (Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center) independently worked to develop a new (hybrid) GH-Advocacy (GHA) rotation. Methods In 2012, both institutions independently developed a global health advocacy rotation, combining experiences from both global health and advocacy curriculum. Both curricula were designed to meet the needs of a variety of learners, with didactic, interactive, group, and reffective activities. Topics addressed in GHA pertain to medical, social, and ethical issues encountered by a global physician. Results Over the past three years two novel curricula were developed in the form of GHA. The third year of global health advocacy rotations were completed in 2015 with a total of 55 residents participating in a GHA, 32 at CMH and 23 at CCHMC. Local GH experiences include medical experiences such as participation in the travel clinics, international adoption clinics, refugee intakes, and immersion in an Indian Health Services Hospital. Non-medical GH experiences include volunteering with refugees, assisting with immigrant community gardens, and home visits with refugee case workers. Advocacy experiences include visiting domestic violence shelters, homeless shelters and local food banks. The strong majority of residents felt this rotation to be a valuable experience. Changes were made to the curricula based on resident feedback and debriefing sessions. Conclusions The GHA has been a successful rotation for two independent institutions. This unique blend of local GH and advocacy specific experiences has allowed residents the opportunity to participate in GH activities without leaving the country. In addition, the residents learned skills working with underserved populations through advocacy experiences that will benefit them abroad someday. These programs may not be generalizable to everyone; however our experience may be valuable to those seeking creative ways to enhance GH opportunities locally.

T1  - 31.4 Adjustment, Loss, and Resilience: Supporting Puerto Rican Child Evacuees to the US Mainland in the Aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria
T3  - AACAP's 65th Annual Meeting. Seattle United States.
A1  - Fortuna L.R. 
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Objectives: The goals of this session are as follows: 1) to consider the impact of Hurricane Maria on the mental health of Puerto Rican youth, especially in the context of resettlement on the mainland United States; 2) to share illustrative case examples of challenges experienced among Puerto Rican youth who have relocated; and 3) to identify ways that schools can help support Puerto Rican children who have relocated. Method(s): This presentation includes a brief overview of how cities with major Puerto Rican enclaves in Massachusetts prepared and responded to the arrival of large numbers of relocated youth and families. The presentation will then provide case examples of how Puerto Rican children have experienced loss and grief and how schools and behavioral health providers have worked to support them in their adaptation. Reflections on how schools, community-based organizations (CBOs), and mental health professionals can collaborate, and a specific example of how a child and adolescent psychiatry program partnered with a local school and CBO to respond to the needs of Puerto Rican families, will be discussed. Result(s): Children and families have suffered displacement, destruction of homes, family separations, homelessness, fatalities, and a need to rapidly adapt to a new environment, culture, and language. Providing supports, including clothing, shelter, and health care, has been part of the first-line response; however, schools and CBOs have begun to create ways to work together to help support children's resilience and connections to their schools and communities. Conclusion(s): Responding to the needs of youth and families relocated from Puerto Rico includes immediate crisis relief and requires a consideration for the longer-term impact of loss and community, family, and environmental changes that can negatively impact mental health in children. Collaborative community and school-based responses help support and promote resilience. COPI, DS, SCCopyright © 2018

N2  - Purpose: To test video games designed to raise awareness of link between weekly marijuana use among youth and psychosis. The Back to Reality Series (the Series trailer https://vimeo.com/140117271)) represents integrated knowledge translation (iKT) products. The Series was inspired by cannabis research and created by an iKT community of youth, youth with lived experiences, clinicians, researchers, and game designers. Method(s): Fifty-five homeless and street-involved youth were interviewed after being randomly assigned in an open trial to play the Series versus a control game. Knowledge about marijuana use, harms, and psychosis was assessed using a quiz- the Psychosis Cannabis Test (PCT). Feedback was qualitatively analyzed for themes regarding gameplay and marijuana use. Result(s): The mean age for the whole sample was 17. 5 (SD = 1.1) with 55% male, 9% gender fluid, and 36% female. Up to 24 % of respondents endorsed past experiences suggestive of psychotic symptoms. The mean PCT score was 5.5 (SD = 1.9) for the 25 participants who played the control game and 6.8 (SD = 1.6) for the 31 participants randomly assigned to the Series. The Series group obtained significantly greater scores (p< .05) on the PCT compared to the control group, indicating greater knowledge of the risks and harms. Most youth (90%) enjoyed playing the Series versus 75% for the control game. Youth believed the Series was educational and felt they could relate to the protagonist's experiences. Conclusion(s): Pilot data provide preliminary evidence that interactive video games can educate youth about the harms associated with marijuana use.

T1  - Feasibility of assessing economic and sexual risk behaviors using longitudinal text message surveys in African-American homeless young adults
T3  - 2018 STD Prevention Conference. Washington, DC United States.

N2  - Background: The EMERGE project aims is to reduce economic drivers of HIV risk in African-American homeless young adults. As part of the design, we conducted a single-group study to examine the feasibility of assessing economic and sexual risk behaviors using text message surveys. Text messages offer the potential of better evaluating HIV behavioral interventions using repeated longitudinal measures at lower cost and research burden. Method(s): We enrolled 17 young adults, aged 18 to 24, who were African-American, homeless, out-of-school, and un/under-employed. Eligible participants reported at least one episode of unprotected sex. Participants were invited to respond to a text message survey once each week for 5 weeks. The survey contained 14 questions with yes-no and numeric responses on sexual risk behaviors (such as condomless sex or sex exchange) and economic behaviors (such as employment or money spent on HIV prevention). We measured the number of participants who responded to the survey, the number of questions to which they responded in each survey, and the number of hours from sending a survey to receiving participant responses. Result(s): Eleven participants responded to at least one text message survey (65%). The average response rate each week was 73% (8 out of 11 active participants). The average number of questions responded to was 9, ranging from 6 to 14. On average, participants responded within 11 hours. Participants were most responsive to questions on number of sexual partners, frequency of condomless sex, sex while drunk or high, and receipt of HIV testing. Non-response rates were highest for sex exchange and money spent on HIV services. Observed strengths of the text message survey were readability and convenience. Observed weaknesses were redundancy, stigma, and non-participation. Conclusion(s): Text message surveys may be a valuable tool for assessing sexual risk behaviors, including economic drivers of HIV, among high-risk urban youth.

T1  - The association between incarceration and transactional sex among HIV-positive young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in the United States

N2  - Background: Criminal justice practices in the United States disproportionately affect sexual and racial/ethnic minority men, who are at higher risk of incarceration. Previous research demonstrates associations between incarceration and sexual risk behaviors for men who have sex with men (MSM). However, little of this work focuses on young MSM (YMSM), particularly HIV-positive YMSM, even though one-third report having ever engaged in sexual risk behaviors such as transactional sex. We therefore explored the association between incarceration and transactional sex among HIV-positive YMSM. Method(s): As part of the CATCH study, we recruited 97 HIV-positive YMSM across 14 Adolescent Trials Network clinical sites from August 2015 to February 2016. Following consent, youth completed an ACASI survey on psychosocial characteristics and medical/behavioral history. We used multivariate logistic regression to examine the association between incarceration (i.e., ever been in jail/prison) and transactional sex (i.e., ever exchanged sex for money or drugs) among YMSM; the Minority Stress Model informed control variable selection. Result(s): The majority of YMSM were 24 years old (78%), identified as racial/ethnic minority (95%), not in school (54%), single (74%), and earned <$12,000/year (67%) nearly half had ever been homeless (41%). Additionally, 42% had been incarcerated and 28% had engaged in transactional sex. In the multivariate model, having ever been incarcerated remained independently associated with having engaged in transactional sex (aOR = 3.20 95% CI: 1.07 to 9.63). Being 24 years old versus younger (aOR = 9.68 95% CI: 1.42 to 65.78) and having ever been homeless (aOR = 3.71 95% CI: 1.18 to 11.65) also remained independently associated with having engaged in transactional sex. Conclusion(s): Incarceration may represent a particularly severe stressor for young men with multiple marginalized identities-HIV-positive, MSM, and racial/ethnic minority-and put them at higher risk for engaging in transactional sex. Tracing the relationship between incarceration and transactional sex highlights a potential key source of health disparities among HIV-positive YMSM it also identifies important targets for subsequent intervention studies-e.g., housing, mental health, employment-that place this population at risk of incarceration and transactional sex. Facilitating HIV-positive YMSM's engagement with community-level and HIV clinic-specific services may serve as a key strategy to promote health and mitigate harms related to incarceration and transactional sex.

N2  - Background Youth represent a growing, and particularly vulnerable, subgroup of the homeless population in urban areas. Social service institutions, health care centers, and voluntary organizations have responded to this growth by creating a variety of programs to assist homeless youth in obtaining food, shelter, and medical care. Still, many of these individuals struggle each day to get the food they need. Only a handful of studies have examined the nutritional quality of meals available to homeless youth and how they obtain food. Lack of data is primarily due to the difficulty in studying this group due to their transiency and distrust of establishment figures. Objective The aim of this study is to create a method to describe how homeless youth access food and the nutritional quality and adequacy of food that they obtain. Methods In this cross-sectional study, investigators orally administer a ~50-item survey, adapted from published research, to homeless youth ages 14 to 24 in the greater Seattle/Tacoma area. Data collection takes place at multiple settings and organizations in which homeless youth access food. Individuals who meet inclusion criteria are invited to participate at these settings and are offered $10 at the completion of the survey. The survey asks information on general demographics; participants' current housing situation; factors relating to their ability to access food; and the kinds of food they acquire. Anonymity of participants is maintained by obtaining verbal assent rather than signed consent. All survey data is entered by researchers on site using REDCapTM software. Summary Creating a method to gain a better understanding of how homeless youth obtain food and the nutritional quality of such food can help social services and nutrition programs improve the network of nutrition services and the quality of food available to this vulnerable population.

N2  - Background: Children and adolescents with deprived backgrounds have high rates of psychiatric problems. Parental and social factors are regarded crucial for children's healthy and positive development but whether children's risk of psychosis in an early age is associated with parental social marginalisation is unknown. We aimed to analyse the association between mothers' and fathers' history of homelessness and the offspring's risk of psychiatric disorders during childhood and adolescence with attention to the specific child and adolescent psychiatric diagnosis: psychosis, as well as to the combined effect of mother's and father's schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and homelessness experiences according to the child's risk of any psychiatric disorder. Method(s): We conducted a nationwide, register-based cohort study of 1,072,882 children aged 0-16 years living or being born in Denmark between Jan 1, 1999 and Dec 31, 2015. Parental homelessness was the primary exposure and offspring's risk of psychosis and other psychiatric disorders the outcome. We analysed the association by survival analysis using Poisson regression and incidence rate ratios (IRRs), adjusted for year and offspring characteristics, and additionally adjusted for parental factors (age at offspring's birth and parental psychiatric disorders). Result(s): In total, 17,238 (2%) offspring had either one or two parents with a history of homelessness, and 56330 (5%) offspring were diagnosed with any psychiatric diagnosis during the study period. Of these, 850 (1.5%) had a diagnosis of psychosis before their 16th birthday. The incidence rate of any psychiatric disorder was 28.2 cases per 1000 person-years (20.7-38.4) in offspring with at least one parent with a history of homelessness and a mother with a schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, compared with 18.3 cases per 1000 person-years (16.8-20.0) in those whose parents had no history of homelessness. The IRR of psychosis in offspring born to a mother with a history of homelessness was 3.1 (95% CI 1.9-5.0) compared with those whose parents had no history of homelessness. A similar risk was found if both parents had a history of homelessness (IRR 5.4, 95% CI 2.7-1.9), whereas no association was found when only the father had experiences of homelessness. Also after full adjustment including parental psychiatric disorders, an increased risk of psychosis was found in offspring if the mother (IRR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0) or both parents (IRR 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-5.9) had a history of homelessness. Highest risk was found for attachment disorder when both parents had a history of homelessness (IRR 32.5, 95% CI 24.6-42.9) and substance use disorder when only the mother experienced homelessness (6.9, 95% CI 4.9-9.7). In offspring whose mother had a history of homelessness and a psychiatric disorder, 36% (95% CI 27%-45%) had received a psychiatric diagnosis themselves by the age of 15. If the mother or father had a schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, homelessness experiences did not add further to the increased risk of any psychiatric disorder in offspring. Discussion(s): Parental homelessness was strongly associated with an increased risk of psychosis and several other severe psychiatric disorders in offspring during childhood and adolescence. These findings have important implications for public health and policy because they suggest a need for improvement in the support of socially marginalised families to help prevent psychiatric illness in offspring. However, our findings also suggested that the risk of any psychiatric disorder in offspring associated with parental homelessness depended on the parental psychiatric diagnoses.

N2  - Background: Nearly one-third of HIV diagnoses among blacks in the United States in 2015 occurred among young people aged 15-24 years, and three-quarters were among men. Viral suppression, which greatly reduces the risk of HIV transmission, increased from 72% in 2009 to 80% in 2013 among persons in HIV care. National data on viral suppression or other clinical outcomes among young black men in HIV care are lacking. Method(s): We analyzed 2009-2014 Medical Monitoring Project (MMP) interview and medical record data collected from 336 black men aged 18-24 years. MMP is a surveillance system that produces nationally representative information about adults with diagnosed HIV in the US. We estimated the proportion of young black men in HIV care who were virally suppressed at last test (current viral suppression) and at all tests in the previous 12 months (durable viral suppression). We also estimated the proportion prescribed antiretroviral therapy (ART) and adherent to ART. We assessed changes over time in all clinical outcomes and certain characteristics associated with each outcome. Result(s): During 2009-2014, 60% of young black men in HIV care were currently virally suppressed, and 36% had durable viral suppression. There was no significant change over time in either viral suppression measure. ART prescription increased from 61% in 2009-2010 to 88% in 2013-2014 (beta=0.13, P for trend <0.05). Overall, 73% of young black men were adherent to ART; this did not change significantly over time. Current viral suppression was lower among the 45% of young black men who used injection or non-injection drugs than among those who did not (49% vs. 68%, P <0.05). Durable HIV viral suppression was lower among the 12% of young black men who were homeless compared with those who were not homeless (23% vs. 38%, P <0.05) and also lower among those who used injection or non-injection drugs than among those who did not (28% vs. 42%, P <0.05). ART adherence was lower among the 20% of young black men who had current depression compared with who did not (53% vs. 78%, P <0.05) and among those who were homeless compared with those who were not (56% vs. 75%, P <0.05). Conclusion(s): Viral suppression among young black men in HIV care was much lower than in the overall population receiving HIV care, and there were no increases in viral suppression or ART adherence among this group during 2009-2014. Improving viral suppression is essential to ensure health and reduce HIV transmission in this key population. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Background The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) provides health, education, and housing services to Palestinian refugees in Lebanon (PRL), and food assistance and welfare support to the most vulnerable refugees. Palestinian refugees recently displaced from Syria (PRS) to Lebanon have placed additional pressures on health and education services, and employment rights of Palestinians remain limited. The objective of this study was to provide an updated profile of the socioeconomic and health status of PRL and PRS after their influx into Lebanon. Methods This nationally representative, multistage, cluster randomised survey of PRL and PRS households was done in April, 2015. Modules on socioeconomic, demographic, health, and food security variables were included. The poverty lines were US$6.84 per person per day for PRL households and $2.47 per person per day for PRS households. Food insecurity was assessed using the Arab Family Food Security Scale. Health conditions were reported for all household members by a household proxy. We used STATA version 13.0 to construct multivariate models to investigate independent predictors of poverty, food insecurity, and chronic disease. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the American University of Beirut. Findings 2974 (88%) of the 3382 eligible PRL and 1050 (89%) of 1171 eligible PRS households gave informed consent and completed the questionnaire. 65% of PRL and 89% of PRS lived under the poverty line, whereas 3% of PRL and 9% of PRS were extremely poor. 62% of PRL and 95% of PRS were food insecure. Household size, unemployment, and low educational attainment of the head of household were associated with both poverty and food insecurity in PRL and PRS households. The prevalence of chronic illness was high in PRL and PRS households, with chronic disease in PRL households reported for 40% of people aged 19-59 years and for 88% of elderly adults (aged >60 years), and chronic disease in PRS households reported for 41% of people aged 19-59 years and for 86% of elderly adults. Chronic illness was independently associated with education and employment, household size, food insecurity, and area of residence. Interpretation Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and those recently displaced from Syria to Lebanon are susceptible to poverty, food insecurity, and chronic illnesses, which vary with similar sociodemographic markers (mainly employment and education). Advocacy is needed to increase employment rights and ensure continued access to education and health services for Palestinians living in Lebanon, particularly with pressures on services resulting from the Syrian crisis.

N2  - Purpose: For this project, Advocates for Youth is collaborating with partners in three communities to pilot and evaluate innovative referral and linkage strategies that build the capacity of health centers and social service agencies to improve contraceptive access for vulnerable youth, and to cull lessons learned to scale these strategies for use in communities across the U.S. Method(s): This 3-year project applies three primary strategies to improving access to contraception, including LARC, to vulnerable populations of teens and young adults: 1) Improving clinical capacity to provide contraceptive care to teens, 2) Youth-led health education and referrals, and 3) networking with and training youth-serving organizations to refer young people for needed clinical services. This project focuses on young people who are at risk of school failure, in foster care or the juvenile justice system, homeless, or recently arrived refugees. In Washington, DC, the project is focused on strengthening a model of drop-in, group-based reproductive health events where young people receive sexual health education and have the option to see a clinician for birth control or STI testing. In Atlanta, GA, the project is developing a coordinated care model that incor-porates a health center and a refugee resettlement agency. In Tucson, AZ, the project is implementing a telehealth model of providing care to youth from community youth-serving organizations. This project is funded by an anonymous private foundation. Result(s): Challenges and lessons learned from the initial year of project implementation in three communities, including needs assessment and focus group findings will be presented, including experiences expanding youth-friendly services, LARC access through pediatric clinics, creating formal linkages and referrals between youth-serving organizations and clinics, and tailoring services to youth with specific needs, such as foster care youth, homeless youth, and recently arrived refugees. Conclusion(s): Despite national decreases in the rate of unintended teen pregnancy, additional strategies are needed to reach youth who are at increased risk or who face increased barriers to obtaining information and clinical services. This project aims to develop strategies to reach vulnerable populations through collaborations between clinics, youth-serving organizations, and youth themselves, and to disseminate models and lessons learned to other communities and organizations.

N2  - Purpose: Adolescent risky sexual behaviors and their associated health concerns are well documented. This program, "Promoting Adoles-cent Health Through School-Based HIV/STD Prevention," addresses such behaviors and the potential negative health outcomes. The overall goal of the program is to reduce HIV/STD rates and births to teens. This collaborative initiative aims to provide equal and ongoing access to evidence-based health education and health services by identifying and addressing health disparities. Method(s): In 2013, the Florida Department of Education was one of 19 state education agencies selected to receive a 5-year grant from the CDC to improve adolescent health. Twelve counties across the state, referred to as "partner districts," were identified based on need and willingness to participate in the program. The steps to reaching the program goal in these partner districts include: 1) the adoption of comprehensive sexual health education policies, 2) implementation of evidence-based, medically accurate sexual health curricula, 3) building the confidence levels of instructors through high-quality professional development, and 4) providing technical assistance to district administrators to identify the value of a referral process for students to receive needed sexual health services. This initiative focuses on building school district capacity to develop, implement and sustain these efforts. The program mirrors national efforts, such as The Future of Sex Education (FoSE) striving to standardize and improve the quality of sex education and the CDC's "16 Recom-mended Topics" for sexual health education. Result(s): Initial results of this program include: 1) the development of a state-wide committee to provide guidance to the program, 2) data collected in seven of the 12 partner districts showing strong support for comprehensive sexual health education, 3) development or re-vision of health education policy to include quality sexual health education in three districts, 4) professional development offered to over 1,200 teachers in the 12 districts, 5) improvements in sexual health curricula in six districts, 6) development or improvements in delivering health services in five districts, and 7) improvements in addressing the sexual health needs of homeless youth in three districts. Conclusion(s): Overall, the majority of partner districts have implemented changes which can have a positive impact on the long-term goal of reducing HIV/STD and teen birth rates. Lessons learned document that many teachers did not know their district policy, most were very supportive to teach this topic and want more professional development in this area, and most community members support youth learning about this topic. Many districts are interested in offering health services on site, and several have begun to do so successfully. Sources of Support: None.

N2  - Purpose: Homeless youths are vulnerable to multiple poor health outcomes owing to substance use and risky sexual behaviors, thus we need to develop and test interventions that assist them in attaining health-promoting skills and habits. These youths are difficult to engage in formalized interventions because they tend to avoid interacting with authorities and they are highly mobile. The purpose of this analysis was to determine if demographic factors differentiated those who became engaged and completed all phases of a randomized intervention study and those who did not. Method(s): This analysis is from an ongoing multi-site longitudinal in-tervention study using a rigorous Solomon four-group design. Youths were enrolled in the study after providing written, informed consent and being screened for current substance use treatment. Each par-ticipant was randomly assigned to one of four groups: intervention or control with pre-tests or intervention or control without pretests. Those assigned to the intervention condition received 6 individualized sessions with a facilitator whereas those assigned to the control condition received services as usual at the recruitment facility. Post-tests were scheduled immediately following the sixth session of the intervention and 3 and 6 months thereafter. For this analysis, we compared those who were randomly assigned to the in-tervention condition (with or without pre-test) and completed all six sessions and all post-tests (i.e., compliant), with those who did not complete all sessions nor all post-tests (noncompliant). Result(s): Male and female participants ranged in age from 18-23 and there were no significant age or sex differences between the compliant and noncompliant groups on sex or age, but there was a significant difference by race/ethnicity (chi2 (9) = 20.34, p =.016) with more Whites in the noncompliant group and more Black and Hispanic in the compliant group. There were significant differences between the compliant and noncompliant groups by school enrollment (chi2 (3) = 7.84, p =.049) and by homelessness owing to parent or guardian's death (chi2 (3) = 10.56, p =.014). Those who were currently enrolled in school or who were homeless owing to a parent's or guardian's death were more likely to be noncompliant. There were no significant differences in the two groups in terms of their primary living arrangements in the past year, sources of earning money in the past six months, having a history of sexual abuse, having been tested for HIV, or for having ever been treated for alcohol or drug abuse. Conclusion(s): Youths who stayed and completed the study and follow-up were more likely to be youths of color, not enrolled in school, and not homeless owing to a parent or guardian's death. Non-significant findings regarding all other demographic variables suggest that this intervention may appeal to a wide variety of homeless youths. Further study is warranted to determine what other factors might account for those who were not able to complete the study and the follow-up measures. Sources of Support: None.

N2  - Purpose: Despite evidence suggesting that they are 16 times more likely to become HIV+ than their housed peers, homeless youth have low rates of uptake and adherence to PrEP or nPEP. Notwithstanding the documented HIV risk and the potential for PrEP and nPEP as feasible prevention strategies, little research has been conducted to determine the knowledge and attitudes regarding PrEP and nPEP among homeless young adults. Method(s): We conducted a cross-sectional survey (2016-2017) among homeless youth 18-25 years old recruited from drop-in centers and shelters in 7 cities in the United States (New York, St. Louis, Denver, Phoenix, Houston, Los Angeles, and San Jose) to assess knowledge and attitudes regarding PrEP and nPEP to inform HIV prevention intervention development. Result(s): Participants (n = 1427) were primarily youth of color (37% Black, 17% Hispanic, 16% mixed, 11% other), 32% LGBTQ, male (58%), female (35%), or transgender (5%), with a mean age of 20.9 years. Re-garding PrEP, 4% of the sample had talked with their provider about PrEP; while 71% had low to no knowledge of PrEP. Despite no/low knowledge, 59% reported they were likely or extremely likely to take PrEP if recommended by their doctor. Significant knowledge differences were found by gender identity and location; transgender youth reported higher knowledge than cisgender males or females (f = 26.48, p <.01), and youth in Los Angeles and New York reported the highest PrEP knowledge (f = 19.45, p <.01). Transgender youth also reported significantly more interest in PrEP than cisgender males or females (f = 12.15, p <.01), though interest was high in the total sample. Access to free PrEP (55%), HIV testing (72%), healthcare (68%), one-on-one counseling on PrEP use (62%), and text messaging support (57%) were all rated as very important or extremely important for PrEP uptake and adherence among participants. Youth had low rates of post-sexual assault healthcare seeking behaviors when nPEP may be indicated for HIV prevention; 71% of youth did not seek post-assault examination despite 24% of youth being sexually assaulted since becoming homeless. Barriers to post-sexual assault examination included not wanting to involve the legal system (21%), not thinking it was important (17%), not knowing what a post-sexual assault exam was (12%), not having health insurance (11%), or being unable to safely leave the situation (9%). Conclusion(s): Results of this study suggest several missed opportunities to prevent new HIV infections among homeless youth. Despite the high risk for HIV among this vulnerable population, PrEP knowledge remains low. Though, once informed, interest in PrEP uptake is high. Efforts to increase PrEP uptake and adherence among homeless youth should consider provider and systems level interventions to decrease PrEP associated healthcare costs, improve access to PrEP providers, and provide both in-person and text messaging support. Further, interventions to address the importance of and reduce system and individual-level barriers to sexual assault examinations can improve HIV prevention efforts among homeless youth. Further re-search is needed to design and test the efficacy of HIV prevention interventions on PrEP and nPEP uptake and adherence among home-less youth.

N2  - Objective: Hard to reach populations need to be included in research studies to ensure proper representation of the general population. This paper explores tracking strategies used in the Youth Matters in London project to retain a sample of homeless youth. Method(s): A total of 187 youth, aged between 16 and 24 years, homeless or precariously housed, and experiencing a serious mental health issue were recruited at a community drop-in center, by word of mouth and by snowball sampling. After the initial interview, three repeat interviews were conducted six months apart. Result(s): The most successful strategy for contacting participants was through a local agency and e-mail. An analysis of the contact data identified participant retention rates as 88%, 86%, and 82% for each successive interview. This longitudinal retention rate is very high compared with research in other vulnerable populations, suggesting a strong willingness to participate in the Youth Matters in London project. Conclusion(s): Retaining a sample of homeless youth is difficult, however, with time, patience and effort it has proven possible. This research underscores the importance of relationships with community agencies to retain vulnerable youth samples in longitudinal research designs.Copyright © 2018, Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

N2  - The Dissociative Symptoms Scale (DSS) was developed to assess moderately severe levels of depersonalization, derealization, gaps in awareness or memory, and dissociative reexperiencing that would be relevant to a wide range of clinical populations. Structural analyses of data from four clinical and five nonclinical samples ( N = 1,600) yielded four factors that reflected the domains of interest and showed good fit with the data. Sample scores were consistent with expectations and showed very good internal consistency and temporal stability. Analyses showed consistent evidence of convergent and divergent validity, and posttrauma elevations in scores and in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder provided additional evidence of construct validity. Item response theory analyses indicated that the items assessed moderately severe dissociative experiences. Overall, the results provide support for the reliability and validity of DSS total and subscale scores in the populations studied. Further work is needed to evaluate the performance of the DSS relative to structured interview measures and in samples of patients with other psychological disorders.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A rapid increase of Medicaid expenditures has been a serious concern, and housing stability has been discussed as a means to reduce Medicaid costs. A program evaluation of a New York City supportive housing program has assessed the association between supportive housing tenancy and Medicaid savings among New York City housing program applicants with serious mental illness and chronic homelessness or dual diagnoses of mental illness and substance use disorder, stratified by distinctive Medicaid expenditure patterns., METHODS: The evaluation used matched data from administrative records for 2827 people. Sequence analysis identified 6 Medicaid expenditure patterns during 2 years prior to baseline among people placed in the program (n=737) and people eligible but not placed (n=2090), including very low Medicaid coverage, increasing Medicaid expenditure, low, middle, high, and very high Medicaid expenditure patterns. We assessed the impact of the program on Medicaid costs for 2 years post-baseline via propensity score matching and bootstrapping., RESULTS: The housing program was associated with Medicaid savings during 2 years post-baseline (-$9526, 95% CI=-$19,038 to -$2003). Stratified by Medicaid expenditure patterns, Medicaid savings were found among those with very low Medicaid coverage (-$15,694, 95% CI=-$35,926 to -$7983), increasing Medicaid expenditures (-$9020, 95% CI=-$26,753 to -$1705), and high Medicaid expenditure patterns (-$14,450, 95% CI=-$38,232 to -$4454). Savings were largely driven by shorter psychiatric hospitalizations in the post-baseline period among those placed., CONCLUSIONS: The supportive housing program was associated with Medicaid savings, particularly for individuals with very low Medicaid coverage, increasing Medicaid expenditures, and high Medicaid expenditures pre-baseline.

N2  - Aims. Incorporating consumer perspectives into mental health services design is important in working to deliver recovery-oriented care. One of the challenges faced in mental health rehabilitation services is limited consumer engagement with the available support. Listening to consumers' expectations of mental health services, and what they hope to achieve, provides an opportunity to examine the alignment between existing services and the priorities and preferences of the people who use them. We explored consumer understandings and expectations of three recovery-oriented community-based residential mental-health rehabilitation units using semi-structured interviews; two of these units were trialling a staffing model integrating peer support with clinical care.Methods. Twenty-four consumers completed semi-structured interviews with an independent interviewer during the first 6 weeks of their stay at the rehabilitation unit. Most participants had a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia or a related psychotic disorder (87%). A pragmatic approach to grounded theory guided the analysis, facilitating identification of content and themes, and the development of an overarching conceptual map.Results. The rehabilitation units were considered to provide a transformational space and a transitional place. The most common reason given for engagement was housing insecurity or homelessness rather than the opportunity for rehabilitation engagement. Differences in expectations did not emerge between consumers entering the clinical and integrated staffing model sites.Conclusions. Consumers understand the function of the rehabilitation service they are entering. However, receiving rehabilitation support may not be the key driver of their attendance. This finding has implications for promoting consumer engagement with rehabilitation services. The absence of differences between the integrated and clinical staffing models may reflect the novelty of the rehabilitation context. The study highlights the need for staff to find better ways to increase consumer awareness of the potential relevance of evidence-based rehabilitation support to facilitating their recovery.Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2017.

N2  - Introduction: Tobacco remains the key modifiable risk factor for the development of a number of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tuberculosis and cancer. Among priority populations, smoking prevalence remains high, smokers tend to relapse more often and earlier and fewer are able to sustain quit attempts. This systematic review provides an update on the literature. Areas covered: Twenty-four randomized controlled trials published from 2010-2017, in English language, were identified after searching on Medline, Ovid, Embase and PsycINFO databases. Studies reported on the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions among six disadvantaged groups known to have high smoking rates: (i) homeless, (ii) prisoners, (iii) indigenous populations, (iv) at-risk youth, (v) people with low income, and (vi) those with a mental illness. Narrative review and assessment of methodological quality of included papers was undertaken. Expert commentary: There is a growing evidence base of methodologically robust studies evaluating a variety of behavioural smoking cessation interventions for priority populations. Multi-component interventions and those examining behavioural interventions incorporating mindfulness training, financial incentives, motivational interviewing and extended telephone-delivered counseling may be effective in the short-term, particularly for smokers on low incomes and people with a mental illness.Copyright © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Purpose Unaccompanied youth homelessness is a serious concern. Response, however, has been constrained by the absence of credible data on the size and characteristics of the population and reliable means to track youth homelessness over time. We sought to address these gaps. Methods Using a nationally representative phone-based survey (N = 26,161), we solicited household and individual reports on different types of youth homelessness. We collected household reports on adolescents aged 13-17 and young adults aged 18-25, as well as self-reports from young adults aged 18-25. Follow-up interviews with a subsample (n = 150) provided additional information on youth experiences and enabled adjustment for inclusion errors. Results Over a 12-month period, approximately 3.0% of households with 13- to 17-year-olds reported explicit youth homelessness (including running away or being asked to leave) and 1.3% reported experiences that solely involved couch surfing, resulting in an overall 4.3% household prevalence of any homelessness, broadly defined. For 18- to 25-year-olds, household prevalence estimates were 5.9% for explicitly reported homelessness, 6.6% for couch surfing only, and 12.5% overall. The 12-month population prevalence estimates, available only for 18- to 25-year-olds, were 5.2%, 4.5%, and 9.7%, respectively. Incidence rates were about half as high as prevalence rates. Prevalence rates were similar across rural and nonrural counties. Higher risk of homelessness was observed among young parents; black, Hispanic, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) youth; and those who did not complete high school. Conclusions The prevalence and incidence of youth homelessness reveal a significant need for prevention and youth-centric systems and services, as well as strategies to address disproportionate risks of certain subpopulations.Copyright © 2017 The Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine

N2  - Background Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that the newest latent tuberculosis (LTBI) regimen, 12 weekly doses of directly observed isoniazid and rifapentine (3HP), is as efficacious as 9 months of isoniazid, with a greater completion rate (82% vs 69%); however, 3HP has not been assessed in routine healthcare settings. Methods Observational cohort of LTBI patients receiving 3HP through 16 US programs was used to assess treatment completion, adverse drug reactions, and factors associated with treatment discontinuation. Results Of 3288 patients eligible to complete 3HP, 2867 (87.2%) completed treatment. Children aged 2-17 years had the highest completion rate (94.5% [155/164]). Patients reporting homelessness had a completion rate of 81.2% (147/181). In univariable analyses, discontinuation was lowest among children (relative risk [RR], 0.44 [95% confidence interval {CI},.23-.85]; P =.014), and highest in persons aged >=65 years (RR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.25-2.35]; P <.001). In multivariable analyses, discontinuation was lowest among contacts of patients with tuberculosis (TB) disease (adjusted RR [ARR], 0.68 [95% CI,.52-.89]; P =.005) and students (ARR, 0.45 [95% CI,.21-.98]; P =.044), and highest with incarceration (ARR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.08-1.89]; P =.013) and homelessness (ARR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.25-2.39]; P =.001). Adverse drug reactions were reported by 1174 (35.7%) patients, of whom 891 (76.0%) completed treatment. Conclusions Completion of 3HP in routine healthcare settings was greater overall than rates reported from clinical trials, and greater than historically observed using other regimens among reportedly nonadherent populations. Widespread use of 3HP for LTBI treatment could accelerate elimination of TB disease in the United States.Copyright © Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America 2017.

N2  - There is limited research on the phenomenology of how young children who have been exposed to trauma express the intrusive symptom of dissociative reactions. The current qualitative study utilized interviews from a semi-structured diagnostic clinical interview with 74 caregivers of young children (ages 3 to 7) who were exposed to trauma to identify parents' descriptions of their children's dissociative reactions during a clinical interview. Based on results from the interview, 45.9% of the children had dissociative reactions (8.5% had flashbacks and 41.9% had dissociative episodes). Interviews were transcribed to identify themes of dissociative reactions in young children. Common themes to flashbacks and dissociative episodes included being triggered, being psychologically in their own world (e.g., spaced out and shut down), and displaying visible signs (e.g., crying and screaming). For flashbacks, caregivers reported that it seemed as if the child was re-experiencing the trauma (e.g., yelling specific words and having body responses). For dissociative episodes, caregivers noted that the child not only seemed psychologically somewhere else (e.g., distant and not there) but also would be physically positioned somewhere else (e.g., sitting and not responding). Caregivers also expressed their own reactions to the child's dissociative episode due to not understanding what was occurring, and trying to interrupt the occurrences (e.g., calling out to the child). Themes, descriptions, and phrases to describe dissociative reactions in young children after trauma can be used to help parents and professionals more accurately identify occurrences of dissociative reactions.Copyright © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Family homelessness is associated with adverse outcomes in mothers and their young children. Evidence-based programs are needed to support the socioemotional needs of these families. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the perceived benefits of participating in a mindfulness program in mother-child dyads receiving services at a therapeutic nursery serving homeless children under the age of 3 years. A convenience sample of 17 predominantly African American mothers participated in in-depth qualitative interviews. Four themes were derived from the data regarding the perceived benefits of the mindfulness program: "me" time, maternal self-regulation, dyadic connectedness, and child well-being. Results demonstrate the perceived benefits of mindfulness on the parent-child relationship and have important implications for families at an increased risk of adverse outcomes. Because homelessness and residential instability confer considerable risk for young children, interventions to support effective parenting are critical.Copyright © 2017 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health

N2  - Objective: The phenomenon of street children in Egypt constitutes a public health concern. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of institutionalised street children in Alexandria, to compare the prevalence of substance abuse and conduct disorder between street children and school children, and to identify predictors of these mental health outcomes among street children. Method(s): Institutionalised street children (n = 102) participated in a cross-sectional comparative study with a matched group of school children (n = 156). An interviewing questionnaire was used to assess demographic characteristics and substance use. Conduct disorder was measured using the Revised Ontario Child Health study scale. Result(s): Poverty, family breakdown, and domestic violence were the main reasons for street children having left home. Street children recorded significantly higher rates of substance use (9.8%) and conduct disorder (35.3%) compared to school children. In street children, smoking was a significant predictor of substance use and conduct disorder. Other predictors of conduct disorder included physical illness and having 5 to 7 siblings. Conclusion(s): Substance abuse and conduct disorder were present among institutionalised street children at higher rates than school children. Absence of basic life needs and disrupted families constituted the main reasons for leaving home. Interventions at the governmental and non-governmental levels are needed.Copyright © 2017 NISC Pty Ltd.

N2  - Background: People who inject drugs (PWID) frequently engage in injection risk behaviours exposing them to blood-borne infections. Understanding the underlying causes that drive various types and levels of risk behaviours is important to better target preventive interventions. Method(s): A total of 2150 PWID in Swedish remand prisons were interviewed between 2002 and 2012. Questions on socio-demographic and drug-related variables were asked in relation to the following outcomes: Having shared injection drug solution and having lent out or having received already used drug injection equipment within a 12month recall period. Result(s): Women shared solutions more than men (odds ratio (OR) 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03; 2.21). Those who had begun to inject drugs before age 17 had a higher risk (OR 1.43, 95% CI 0.99; 2.08) of having received used equipment compared to 17-19year olds. Amphetamine-injectors shared solutions more than those injecting heroin (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.64; 3.62). A housing contract lowered the risk of unsafe injection by 37-59% compared to being homeless. Conclusion(s): Women, early drug debut, amphetamine users and homeless people had a significantly higher level of injection risk behaviour and need special attention and tailored prevention to successfully combat hepatitis C and HIV transmission among PWID.

N2  - Homeless young adults exhibit high rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and sexual risk behaviors. This study is a secondary analysis of data collected in a randomized clinical trial of AWARE, a new 4 session group motivational interviewing intervention. AWARE mainly focused on alcohol use and sexual risk behavior given focus group feedback. We used sequential coding to analyze how the group process affected both AOD use and sexual risk behavior at 3-month follow up among homeless young adults by examining facilitator behavior and participant change talk (CT) and sustain talk (ST). We analyzed 57 group session digital recordings of 100 youth (69% male, 74% heterosexual, 28% non-Hispanic white, 23% African American, 26% Hispanic, 23% multiracial/other; mean age 21.75). Outcomes included importance and readiness to change AOD use and risky sexual behavior, AOD use and consequences, number of partners and unprotected sex, and condom self-efficacy. Sequential analysis indicated that facilitator open-ended questions and reflections of CT increased Group CT. Group CT was associated with a lower likelihood of being a heavy drinker 3 months later; Group ST was associated with decreased readiness and confidence to change alcohol use. There were no associations with CT or ST for drug use or risky sexual behavior. Facilitator speech and peer responses were related to CT and ST during the group sessions with this high risk population, which were then associated with individual changes for alcohol use. Further research is needed to explore associations with drug use and sexual risk behavior.Copyright © 2017 American Psychological Association.

N2  - Objective: Foreign-origin street children are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS mainly due to poverty, violence, early sexual activity and poor access to health care services. This study aimed to highlight the effectiveness of peer education intervention to reduce HIV-risky behavior among street children with Afghan nationality. Method(s): Sixty-one street children were stratified by sex and then randomly allocated to either an intervention or control group by assigning each participant computerized random numbers. The intervention provided peer education services, focused on mode of disease transmission, prevention approaches and awareness of HIV/AIDS services by peers. Result(s): At least 80% of participants in the intervention and control groups completed the study period, respectively. At the end of the study, statistically significant increase of knowledge and attitude improvement as well as a decreased tendency to do risky sexual intercourse among the intervention subjects was shown. Moreover, there was a time intervention interaction for knowledge and attitude improvements followed by intervention (interaction p value = 0.001), while it was not significant for risky sexual behavior (interaction p value = 0.44). Conclusion(s): Peer education was an effective and easy-to-apply educational method that increased knowledge and improved attitudes about HIV/AIDS among foreign-origin street children, while it was less efficient with regard to long-term reduction in risky sexual behavior.Copyright © 2017

N2  - Objective To assess the extent to which housing instability is associated with gaps in health insurance coverage of preschool-age children. Methods Secondary analysis of data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort, a nationally representative study of children born in the United States in 2001, was conducted to investigate associations between unstable housing-homelessness, multiple moves, or living with others and not paying rent-and children's subsequent health insurance gaps. Logistic regression was used to adjust for potentially confounding factors. Results Ten percent of children were unstably housed at age 2, and 11% had a gap in health insurance between ages 2 and 4. Unstably housed children were more likely to have gaps in insurance compared to stably housed children (16% vs 10%). Controlling for potentially confounding factors, the odds of a child insurance gap were significantly higher in unstably housed families than in stably housed families (adjusted odds ratio 1.27; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.61). The association was similar in alternative model specifications. Conclusions In a US nationally representative birth cohort, children who were unstably housed at age 2 were at higher risk, compared to their stably housed counterparts, of experiencing health insurance gaps between ages 2 and 4 years. The findings from this study suggest that policy efforts to delink health insurance renewal processes from mailing addresses, and potentially routine screenings for housing instability as well as referrals to appropriate resources by pediatricians, would help unstably housed children maintain health insurance.Copyright © 2017 Academic Pediatric Association

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Purpose No research has examined childbirth from a national perspective among females emancipating from foster care. The present study fills this gap by: (1) documenting the rates of initial and repeat births among females ages 17 and 19 in a national prospective study and (2) identifying risk and protective factors at age 17 that predict childbirth between ages 17 and 19. Methods This study used data from the National Youth in Transition Database and Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System to identify risk and protective factors associated with childbirth in a national sample of transition-age female youth (N = 3,474). Results The cumulative rate of childbirth by age 19 was 21%, with higher rates reported between ages 17 and 19 (17%; n = 602) compared with age 17 or earlier (9%; n = 313). In logistic regression analysis, black race and Hispanic ethnicity, placement with relatives, runaway status, trial home visit placement, early emancipation from foster care, and lifetime incarceration histories were associated with increased likelihood of childbirth. In contrast, school enrollment and employment skills were associated with decreased likelihood of childbirth. The multivariate odds of childbirth between ages 17 and 19 increased 10-fold if youth already had a child by age 17. Conclusions Sexual health and pregnancy prevention programs should specifically target youths who already have children. Increased attention should be paid to adolescents placed with biological families and those with histories of criminal involvement.Copyright © 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine

N2  - Children living in households that have recently become food insecure may be particularly vulnerable to adverse weight and dietary changes, but longitudinal studies examining these associations are lacking. Using data from 501 Head Start preschoolers from Michigan (48% male) who were followed during one school year as a part of a randomized obesity prevention trial, we examined changes in children's adiposity indices and dietary quality according to changes in household food insecurity. Household food insecurity change status was categorized as persistently food secure, became food secure, persistently food insecure, or became food insecure. Linear mixed effects models were used to estimate relative changes in BMI-for-age z scores (BAZ), triceps skinfolds-for-age z scores (TAZ), or diet quality (assessed with the 2010 Healthy Eating Index) over the school year according to food insecurity category. We found that girls from households that became food insecure over the year had a 0.21 unit higher gain in BAZ than girls from households that were persistently food secure, after adjustment for potential confounders (95% CI 0.02 to 0.39, P = 0.03). Girls from households that became food secure had improvements in dietary quality over the year compared to girls from persistently food insecure households (adjusted difference in Healthy Eating Index score change = 9.1 points; 95% CI 3.0 to 15.0; p = 0.003). There were no statistically significant associations with changes in TAZ. Among boys, there were no associations between changes in household food insecurity and changes in BAZ, TAZ, or dietary quality. In summary, we found that BMI and diet quality changes of Head Start preschool girls were correlated with short-term changes in household food insecurity. Continued research efforts should focus on identifying the most effective ways to promote the health of children in food insecure households, especially those who may have recently transitioned or are transitioning into food insecurity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Malnutrition and infection are major barriers to educational access and achievement in low-income countries and also work in conjunction with each other in deteriorating wellness and productivity of school adolescents. A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of school-based nutrition education using a peer-led approach, health promotion through school media and health clubs. Data were collected at baseline, midline and end line from sampled participants. To account for the effect of time trend, the difference was measured using a repeated measure analysis. Variables that have p<=0.25 in the bivariate analyses were entered into multivariables to determine the independent effect of interventions. There is a significant difference in food variety between food secure and insecure households (p<0.01). A significant improvement of animal source dietary intake was observed among intervention schools (p<0.001) that was significantly associated with an intervention [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.26, confidence interval (CI): 0.16, 0.42], male gender (AOR=0.48, CI: 0.31, 0.73) and household economic status (AOR=1.69, CI: 1.01, 2.84). The control group had high body mass index (BMI) at baseline, but a significant improvement was observed among the intervention schools, which positively associated with male gender (AOR=4.13, CI: 2.38, 7.15) and having a middle-income family (AOR=2.93, CI: 1.92, 6.15). This study showed that by integrating a dietary intervention into school-based activities, there might be significant improvements in dietary intake of primary school adolescents. Therefore, school-based nutrition education programs should be a part of comprehensive school health programs to reach the students and potentially their families.Copyright © 2017 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

N2  - Homeless young adults ages 18-25 exhibit high rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use, and sexual risk behaviors such as unprotected sex. Yet few programs exist for this population that are both effective and can be easily incorporated into settings serving this population. This pilot cluster cross-over randomized controlled trial evaluates AWARE, a voluntary four session group-based motivational interviewing (MI) intervention to reduce AOD use and sexual risk behavior. We evaluated AWARE with 200 homeless young adults using drop-in center services in Los Angeles County (mean age = 21.8 years; 73% male; 79% heterosexual; 31% non-Hispanic White, 25% African American, 24% Hispanic, 21% multiracial/other). Surveys were completed at baseline and three months after program completion. Retention in the AWARE program was excellent (79% attended multiple sessions) and participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the program. AWARE participants self-reported positive change in their past 3 month and past 30 day alcohol use (ps <= 0.05), motivation to change drug use (ps < 0.05), and condom use self-efficacy (p = 0.05) compared to the control group. Among those with multiple sex partners, AWARE participants showed a decrease in unprotected sexual events (p < 0.05), whereas the control group did not. Results from this pilot evaluation are promising, suggesting that a brief group-MI risk reduction intervention can be effective in helping homeless young adults make positive changes in their alcohol and condom use. Further work is needed to more fully evaluate the efficacy of AWARE on AOD behavior and sexual risk behavior outcomes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background Nonmedical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD) among youth and young adults is being increasingly recognized as a significant public health problem. Homeless youth in particular are more likely to engage in NMUPD compared to housed youth. Studies suggest that network norms are strongly associated with a range of substance use behaviors. However, evidence regarding the association between network norms and NMUPD is scarce. We sought to understand whether social network norms of NMUPD are associated with engagement in NMUPD among homeless youth. Methods 1046 homeless youth were recruited from three drop-in centers in Los Angeles, CA and were interviewed regarding their individual and social network characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to evaluate the significance of associations between social norms (descriptive and injunctive) and self-reported NMUPD. Results Approximately 25% of youth reported past 30-day NMUPD. However, more youth (32.28%) of youth believed that their network members engage in NMUPD, perhaps suggesting some pluralistic ignorance bias. Both descriptive and injunctive norms were associated with self-reported NMUPD among homeless youth. However, these varied by network type, with presence of NMUPD engaged street-based and home-based peers (descriptive norm) increasing the likelihood of NMUPD, while objections from family-members (injunctive norm) decreasing that likelihood. Conclusions Our findings suggest that, like other substance use behaviors, NMUPD is also influenced by youths' perceptions of the behaviors of their social network members. Therefore, prevention and interventions programs designed to influence NMUPD might benefit from taking a social network norms approach.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Cognitive impairments are common in homeless youth and negatively impact academic and vocational outcomes. We examined the feasibility and efficacy of cognitive interventions provided to 18- to 22-year-old homeless youth living in urban supportive housing. Ninety-one homeless youth were randomized to receive either targeted cognitive training (cognitive remediation) or general cognitive activation (computer skills training). Cognitive and psychological outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 13 and 26 sessions, and 1 month postintervention. A high dropout rate highlighted the feasibility challenges of treating this population. Intent-to-treat analysis found significant improvements across groups in specific and global measures of cognition and psychological distress, with no significant group differences. Transition-age homeless youth show improvements in cognitive and psychological functioning when engaged in interventions that address their cognitive development. This speaks to the malleability of cognitive skills in this cohort and lays the groundwork for future research to address their cognitive health.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Background: In several EU countries, synthetic cathinone (SC) use has spread among injecting drug users (IDUs); it has been linked to risk of dependence and HIV/HCV transmission. Aim(s): To analyze the association between dependence and risky injecting practice with experimental and repeated SC use in the past 12 months among the clients of needle-syringe programs in the Czech Republic. Method(s): IDUs in six locations in the Czech Republic were surveyed in 2013 and 2014 (n = 463). Single-predictor multinomial logit models were run to determine SC use upon the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) and risky injecting practice; the same predictors were included in the multivariate model with confounders. Finding(s): SDS score and risky injecting practice were significantly associated with repeated SC use in single-predictor models but not in the multivariate model; SC experimentation was linked to young and male respondents and those who lived in a larger city (>50,000); predictors of repeated SC use were homelessness (AOR = 3.2), co-occurring use of stimulants and opioids (AOR = 4.3), and use of cannabis (AOR = 2.4) in the past month. Conclusion(s): Repeated SC use was associated with poly-drug use and homelessness; given the rather inferior status of SCs among IDUs, their users face a risk of stigmatization and further marginalization.Copyright © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - One of third of people who require mental health services have at least one personality disorder (PD) characterized by maladaptive inner experience and behavior. Since people with PDs can possess very different personality disturbances, they have at least one thing in common: their mental illness will not remit without professional intervention. However, exactly what that intervention should consist of remains a subject for debate. People with personality disorders exhibit chronic, pervasive problems getting along with people in all kinds of different contexts. As a result, people with the disorders often don't seek treatment, and those who do often drop out. For example, people with borderline personality disorder (BPD)-the most commonly treated personality disorder-quit treatment programs about 70 percent of the time. The bulk of research has focused on BPD. While the challenges are numerous and the research is preliminary, two interventions in particular-dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and cognitive therapy (CT)-show promise for BPD. Still, psychologists seeking to treat the other nine personality disorders face a paucity of existing research. The good news: New theories on the underlying emotional regulation, interpersonal styles and thought patterns characteristic of these less-studied PDs have laid the groundwork for developing interventions. Many people with BPD harm themselves to regulate their emotions. In an effort at self-stabilization, some use physical pain-which has been demonstrated to reduce emotional arousal. Practitioners encourage BPD patients to develop alternative ways to control their frequently overwhelming and confusing feelings. For instance, a therapist may teach mindfulness, a concept borrowed from Zen Buddhism. Practicing mindfulness allows clients to observe their emotions without reacting to them or seeking instant relief through self-harm. At the same time, the therapist needs to appreciate the reality of the client's emotions. BPD patients require emotional acceptance-a DBT staple-because they often lacked it as children. In an invalidating environment, for example, a child might express anger and be told by a parent that she is jealous. They never gain a sense that their needs, wants and desires are reasonable. Adding that such circumstances can lead to emotional difficulties and a problematic sense of self. DBT helps these people restore their sense of self, and legitimizes their emotional experience. Evidence seems to back DBT's efficacy. In one study published 58 women with BPD were either assigned to DBT or treatment as usual-generally a weekly session with a psychotherapist. In the study, a team of clinicians assessed the participants' self-harming and damaging impulsive behavior, such as gambling and substance abuse, using the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index. After seven months of therapy, DBT-treated participants more successfully reduced suicide attempts, self-mutilating and self-damaging behaviors than those who received treatment as usual. Additionally, DBT patients were nearly twice as likely to stay in therapy. This study, shows that DBT can be learned and applied effectively by teams other than her own, she explains. While DBT emphasizes emotional regulation, CT conceptualize all 10 personality disorders as dysfunctional core beliefs about the self, others and the world. The cognitive therapist helps people with these disorders learn to identify and change these core beliefs. This is most often accomplished by weekly sessions with a trained therapist. A person with BPD, for example, may believe "I'm defective, helpless, vulnerable and bad. Everything that they do, everything that happens, ends up maintaining these beliefs.nIf they don't give money to a homeless person, they think they are bad. If they do, they think they should have given more. To root out such dysfunctional beliefs, CT practitioners often must help patients revisit and reinterpret early-childhood experiences. For example, a person may have picked up the belief, "I'm inadequate," because his parents had assigned him responsibilities he was not developmentally ready for. "Perhaps he was asked to take care of his younger siblings, and, not unreasonably, he failed". CT practitioners ask clients to move beyond thinking of such events as proof of inadequacy and instead explore alternative meanings. Ideally, the patient comes to understand the underpinnings of dysfunctional core beliefs and works to change them. However, problems can emerge if a patient interrupts that process by applying his or her dysfunctional beliefs to therapy itself. Axis I patients often come to therapy believing 'I can trust my therapist, this is going to work. Axis II patients may think things like 'I can't trust my therapist, she might hurt me,' or 'If I listen to my therapist it will show how weak I am and how strong she is. To counteract such dysfunctional thinking, therapists should be ready to help patients examine dysfunctional beliefs about the therapist or therapy. Preliminary trials of cognitive therapy for BPD lend support to Beck's theory. In one such study 32 people with BPD benefited from cognitive therapy sessions conducted weekly over one year. Their borderline symptoms came down significantly after a year of therapy. At follow-up, 55 percent of the participants no longer met diagnostic criteria for BPD. While pilot studies have been promising, cognitive therapy has not yet been shown as an effective therapy for personality disorders other than BPD. Despite the divergences of their approaches, many psychologists agree that while treating personality disorders is not easy, it isn't impossible. "That personality disorders are not treatable was a myth that occurred because there was very little empirical research [on treatments]. As more studies get published, we will see that start to change.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Objectives: On August 27 2015, Dominica experienced tropical storm "Erika" after which 574 people were left homeless and 713 were evacuated/displaced. This study aimed to understand the experiences of the impact of the storm on the health of the displaced survivors, including, the perceived health priorities of the survivors, and the government's response. Design and Methods: A focus group discussion was conducted with four key informants from the Ministry of Health, followed by semi-structured individual interviews with 11 displaced survivors ages 22 to 70 years originally from the communities of Dubique, Petite Savanne and Bath Estate. All interviews and the focus group were audio recorded, transcribed, coded inductively for emerging themes, based on a grounded theory approach. Result(s): The primary perceived healthcare need identified by both the Ministry and displaced survivors was mental health services for adults and their children. Other key needs were healthy foods and employment which would reduce the stress of providing for families. The importance of social cohesion also emerged as participants were cognizant of having lost their social support networks from their home communities having been displaced by the disaster. Conclusion(s): The need for continuous counselling was clearly indicated by survivors and key informants alike. It is recommended that the government consider educating the public on the benefits of addressing mental-health issues such as, stress, loss of social support post-disaster, in order for displaced survivors to feel comfortable doing so, due to the stigma attached to accessing these services.

T1  - Exploring the risky sexual behaviour and use of condom among homeless women in New Delhi city, India
T3  - 5th Asia Pacific Conference on Public Health. Kuching Malaysia.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Objectives: The objective of this research is to explore the risky sexual behaviour and the dynamic of contraceptive use among the homeless women in New Delhi city. Method(s): The data was collected during July-December 2015. A total of 300 homeless women above 15 years living in New Delhi were interviewed on various issues; i.e., homelessness, living condition, sexual and reproductive health. A structured interview tool and semi-structured in-depth and key informant tool were developed. The tools were pretested before final data collection. Result(s): About one-third homeless women had intercourse before the age of 13 years and 85% had before age of 18 years. Two-third women reported the first intercourse happened forcefully and only 12% women used condom at that time. About 10% women had sex with multiple partners in last six months. Use of condom during sex is not common among the homeless women as only 40% ever had used condom. Only 5% use condom every time they had sex, while 35% use sometimes or rarely in last six months. As reported by the respondents, sex without concern, lack of information and lack of accessibility for a contraceptive methods are emerged as the major reasons for not using condom. It is also observed that about half of the respondents had five or more number of living children. About 40% suffered from STI. Conclusion(s): The study found that the homeless women have a high risky sexual behaviour as they had to intercourse at early age and don't use condom. This leads to high prevalence of STI as well as higher number of children. The study suggests that it is necessary to make awareness on the benefits of protected sex and also condoms should be distributed frequently among the homeless women to have protected and health sexual life.

N2  - Purpose: There is lack of data on vision problems in homeless children living in shelters. We performed a cross-sectional clinical study to assess the prevalence of visual impairment and to identify unmet eye care needs in children and parents/legal guardians (P/LGs) residing in family shelters. Method(s): From each participating shelter, 10 English-speaking families with at least one child age 16 or younger were randomly recruited. Information regarding each family member's socio-demographics, medical history, visual complaints, and access to eye care was collected through a structured interview. Comprehensive visual screening and funduscopy were performed for P/LGs. All children underwent refraction, slit-lamp, ocular motility and dilated funduscopic examination. Result(s): Forty-nine families from 5 shelters were included: 55 adults and 86 children. Mean age was 34.9 +/- 9.3 years and 6.1 +/- 4.3 years for adults and children respectively. 90.9% of adults and 54.6% of children were females. Despite 49.1% of adults having previously owned glasses, only 25.5% owned them at the time of study. Amongst P/LGs, 38.5% reported dissatisfaction with their own vision and 6.5% had concerns that their children had eye problems. P/LGs reported less likelihood to access care for an eye problem in the last year than to access care for their children (adults 36.4%, children 81.8%). Best corrected visual acuity in the worse seeing eye was 20/50 or worse in 12.7% of adults and 7.8% of children. 43.6% of adults and 26.7% of children had pertinent ocular findings. The commonest finding in adults was refractive error (66.6%). Amongst the children, refractive errors (60.9%) and strabismus (17.4%) were the commonest reasons for further treatment. Other conditions that were identified included glaucoma, penetrating trauma, optic neuropathy, corneal opacity and epiretinal membranes in the adults and in children, nasolacrimal duct obstruction, optic nerve asymmetry, cataract, and phthisis bulbi. Conclusion(s): This is the first study to assess ocular health in children residing in Canadian shelters. This study highlights a gap between P/LGs' perception of vision problems and actual percentage of children found to have ocular abnormalities. Identifying children with ocular needs and directing them to appropriate eye services in a timely fashion is an integral part of addressing health care needs of this vulnerable population.

N2  - Objectives: Pregnancy rates among homeless youth are approximately four to eight times those of their housed peers. Studies pertaining to contraceptive use among this population are notably scarce. Thus, this study explores, in greater depth than past research, homeless youths' experiences, attitudes and decision making regarding contraception. Method(s): Utilizing a semistructured interview guide, phenomenological qualitative data were obtained from interviews with 30 female, male and gender-fluid homeless youth, aged 18-21, who were residing at a youth-serving shelter. Two coders independently analyzed the interview transcripts. To accurately capture homeless youths' experiences regarding contraception, transcripts were examined through three rounds of coding: initial "open" coding; holistic, "middle-order" coding; and final, "focused" coding. Result(s): Though many youth reported that they preferred to wait for pregnancy, few were using contraceptives, and all reported that contraceptive use was rare among homeless youth in general. The most common reasons reported for not using contraceptives were perceptions of exorbitant cost and inaccessibility. Most youth did not know where to obtain contraception and cited additional barriers of transportation, fear of judgment by providers pertaining to their homelessness and not having space to store (oral) contraceptives. Some youth indicated pregnancy ambivalence or "invincibility" against pregnancy, although most expressed interest in learning more about contraception, particularly from caring, nonjudgmental adults or health professionals. Conclusion(s): Findings suggest that unmet need for contraception is particularly high among homeless youth and that aggressive efforts to provide sexual health education and to increase accessibility are urgently needed for this group.

T1  - Abortion among homeless youth: Results from a qualitative study

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Objectives: Homeless youth demonstrate exceptionally high pregnancy rates, although limited research exists on this population's abortion attitudes and experiences. Moreover, several preliminary studies noted that some homeless youth attempt self-induced abortions via unsafe methods. Accordingly, this study explores, in greater detail than prior research, homeless youths' experiences, attitudes and decision making regarding abortion, including self-induced abortion. Method(s): Phenomenological qualitative data were collected from interviews with 30 female, male and gender-fluid homeless youth, aged 18-21, who were staying at a youth-serving shelter. Using a semistructured interview guide, several family planning topics, including abortion, were explored. Qualitative transcripts were independently analyzed by two coders to increase rigor and reduce bias in analyses. To comprehensively, yet concisely, summarize homeless youths' experiences regarding these topics, transcripts underwent three rounds of coding: initial "open" coding; holistic, "middle-order" coding; and final, "focused" coding. Result(s): Youth noted that abortions obtained in the formal medical system are common in this population. Surprisingly, most respondents also knew of others who had attempted self-induced abortions using dangerous strategies, and several youth recounted their own stories of self-induction attempts while homeless. The majority of respondents did not know where and how to access abortions safely, feared abortion-related stigma and reflected inaccurate perceptions regarding abortion cost and legality. Conclusion(s): Findings suggest significant misperceptions about access to and cost of abortion, and an alarmingly high prevalence of self-induction strategies. This indicates an urgent need to develop culturally responsive prevention and family planning outreach for this uniquely vulnerable population.

N2  - Introduction: Vaso-Occlusive Crisis (VOC), the most common manifestation of sickle cell disease (SCD), is the first cause of death, particularly when complicated by an acute chest syndrome (ACS). In the PRESEV1 study, we developed a predictive score of secondary ACS in SCD patient admitted in the hospital for VOC (AUC = 0.840 [95% CI: 0.780-0.900]), with a negative predictive value of 98.8% for the low level risk and a positive predictive value of 39.5%. The aim of the PRESEV-2 study is to validate the predictive score of ACS on adults and children with SCD in Europe and Africa. Herein we present preliminary data on 235 adults with a severe VOC included in 11 referral centers from 4 countries. Patients and Methods: We conduct an international multicenter prospective observational study. The primary outcome measure is the occurrence of an ACS. The ACS is defined as a new auscultatory abnormality (crepitation or bronchial breathing) OR the association of a new radiologic infiltrate AND chest pain or decreased breath sounds. Secondary outcome measures are length of hospitalization, transfusion, morphine consumption, mortality and hospitalization in intensive care unit. Inclusion criteria are: SS or S-b0 thalassemia patients, VOC admitted at the emergency unit (VOC is defined as pain or tenderness affecting at least one part of the body not attributable to other causes) that required hospitalization and opioids (level 3). Exclusion criteria are: no inaugural ACS, homeless patients, pregnancy, deprived of their liberty or under guardianship, unable to understand the purpose and conditions of carrying out the study, unable to give consent. Result(s): From march 201 6 to june 201 7, 11 2 adult patients were included in Africa and 1 22 adults in Europe. Patients in Africa were younger than in Europe with a mean age, respectively, of 26 +/- 7 yrs and 29 +/- 8 yrs (p=0.008). Sex ratio (M/F) in Africa was 0.84 and 0.95 in Europe. Use of hydroxyurea was significantly higher in Europe (65%) than in Africa (6%) (p<0.0001). The ACS incidence was significantly higher in Africa than in Europe, respectively 22% and 11% (OR=2.24; p=0.03), in both areas the time for ACS appearance was the second day. Transfusion was performed in 27% in Africa and 6% in Europe (p<0.001), ACS was the main cause of transfusion (53.3% in Africa and 62.5% in Europe). Patients with ACS were more transfused in Africa than in Europe, respectively 64% and 35.7% but the difference was not significant. Mortality was 3.6% in Africa and was not observed in Europe; circumstances of death were stroke (1), profound anemia (1), kidney failure (1) and VOC (1). Discussion and conclusion: Our preliminary results provide epidemiologic insights about VOC and ACS incidence in Europe and Africa. A better availability of HU treatment in Africa is a health care priority.

N2  - Objectives: A growing body of research shows that transgender- and gender-nonconforming youths experience more harassment, violence, and abuse than peers. A vulnerable population, "gender-expansive" youth, face a higher risk of substance abuse, depression, and suicidality and are disproportionately represented among homeless youth. These patients experience significant barriers to access for gender-affirming healthcare. Given the unique needs of this population, clinics have been developed with the intent of improving and integrating services for gender-expansive youth. This study aims to explore gender clinic models currently in place, with the intent of building a framework for development of future clinics. Method(s): Eighteen clinics providing care to transgender youth younger than age 18 years were identified in nine northeastern states and asked to complete an online survey. Twelve programs (n = 12) responded to the survey, with questions divided into the following: 1) objective data on clinic structure and population characteristics; and 2) subjective responses regarding challenges, strengths, and areas for growth. Result(s): All 12 clinics offer care coordination and hormone therapy. A majority offer primary care, sexual health, and HIV services, endocrinology, gynecology, nutrition, peer support, and individual therapy. A smaller number offer legal services, housing support, crisis intervention, family groups, substance abuse treatment, and surgical support. Among challenges identified were the alignment of goals between parents and children and the structural concerns (e.g., embedding within larger institutions, lack of resources, access to transportation, and lack of shelters). Strengths included the integration of multidisciplinary services, ongoing collection of patient feedback, family-centered care, group information sessions, institution-wide support and trainings, and 24-hour crisis services. Respondents hope to expand to more providers, more support groups, younger patients, wider specialist networks, enhanced websites, and improved medical records. Conclusion(s): Clinics throughout the Northeast have taken creative, multidisciplinary approaches to improve integration and delivery of services for transgender youth that can serve as an inspiration for other institutions nationwide.

T1  - A family intervention for recently homeless youth
T3  - 64th Annual Meeting American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, AACAP 2017. Washington, DC United States.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Objectives: Newly homeless youth are at increased risk for engaging in risky behaviors, including risky substance use and sexual behaviors. However, family-based interventions can be effective among this population. This presentation will discuss the components of the Support to Reunite, Involve, and Value Each Other (STRIVE) intervention, a family-based intervention for recently homeless youth, implementing the intervention among high-risk populations, and will highlight the implications for clinicians working with diverse high-risk youth. Method(s): The STRIVE intervention is a brief five-session family intervention program provided to recently homeless youth and guardians, usually in their home. The sessions consist of skills that involve repeated feedback and practice by the families and focus on improving family climate, enhancing family functioning, and improving problem solving and conflict resolution among the families. The STRIVE intervention was delivered to recently homeless youth in Southern California and was found to significantly decrease alcohol and substance use and sexual risk behaviors as well and is being implemented among other high-risk populations. Result(s): STRIVE is now being used among other high-risk populations, including formerly incarcerated youth. This presentation will describe the components of the STRIVE intervention and implementing this intervention among high-risk youth. Presenters will discuss important lessons from taking a family-based approach to newly homeless youth and provide practical implications for the child psychiatrist and mental health provider working with this high-risk population. Conclusion(s): Newly homeless youth can be a challenging population for child mental health clinicians given the risk of youth engaging in substance use and risky behaviors and traditional lack of family involvement. However, engaging early with a family-based intervention can decrease the risky behaviors and may be an important point of intervention to prevent future homelessness.

N2  - Objectives: High-risk youth and families-including homeless youth and families and foster care youth-represent a significant public health challenge in the United States. Although these youth and families are at risk for poor health, mental health, and social outcomes, there are innovative approaches and psychosocial interventions for these populations that can improve care Methods: Five perspectives on providing care to high-risk youth and families will be presented, including adapting interventions to meet the distinct needs of these populations, findings from unique individual and family-based interventions, and practical skills for providers. Result(s): Dr. Roya Ijadi-Maghsoodi from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) will present the perspectives of homeless veteran families and lessons from partnering with recently homeless parents to adopt a family resilience intervention. Dr. Niranjan Karnik from Rush University will describe a novel mobile health intervention delivered to homeless youth in Chicago. Dr. Norweeta Milburn from UCLA will discuss a brief family-based approach for recently homeless youth, the STRIVE (Support to Reunite, Involve, and Value Each Other) intervention, and implications for providers working with newly homeless adolescents. Dr. Lauren Marlotte from UCLA will deliver an overview of working with foster care families and foster youth in college and tools for providers. Dr. Jeanne Miranda of UCLA will discuss her work developing a manualized Adoption-Specific Intervention (ADAPT), an intervention for families adopting older youth from foster care, and results from a recent randomized trial. Dr. Patricia Lester of UCLA, an expert in familycentered interventions, will serve as a discussant. Conclusion(s): There are emerging interventions and approaches to reaching and improving care for high-risk youth and families. Child psychiatrists and mental health clinicians working on the frontlines can use these approaches and tools to improve care for these important populations.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Objectives: There are increasing efforts to adopt older youth from foster care, given that youth who "age out" of the foster care system are at increased risk for homelessness, incarceration, and poor academic outcomes, yet research demonstrates that older foster care youth often have histories of trauma, substance exposure in utero, and risk of multiple placements, which can affect behavioral and adoption outcomes. Furthermore, there are few evidence-based interventions designed for families adopting older youth from foster care. The goal of this presentation is to describe a unique manualized Adoption-Specific Intervention (ADAPT) intervention, developed specifically for families adopting older foster care youth. Important lessons for mental health clinicians working with families of adopted youth will be discussed. Method(s): We present early results from a small open and recently initiated the randomized trial of ADAPT versus care as usual for older children (ages 5-16 years) adopted from the foster care system. Outcomes include child symptomatology, parent stress, and progress on parent-defined behavioral goals. Result(s): Early results show that children assigned to the ADAPT intervention improve in terms of symptomatology and parent-defined behavioral goals. Parental stress does not appear to improve following the intervention. Implications of this intervention and early findings will be provided for clinicians working with this population in the community. Conclusion(s): The ADAPT intervention holds promise for improving outcomes for older children adopted from foster care.

N2  - Background and objectives: Studies in the urban informal settlements show widespread inappropriate infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices and high rates of food insecurity. These together with unique challenges with regards to child survival in these settings has led to widespread and persistent under-nutrition rates. Globally, few studies have explored the linkage between food security and infant feeding practices. This study assessed the association between household food security and IYCF practices in two urban informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. Method(s): The study adopted a longitudinal study design that involved a census sample of 1110 children less than 12 months of age and their mothers aged between 12-49 years. A researcher-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on infant and young child feeding practices (initiation of complementary foods, dietary diversity, frequency of feeding and minimum acceptable diet); household food security; maternal demographic and socio-economic characteristics. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between food insecurity and IYFC practices having controlled for maternal demographic and socio- economic characteristics as these may influence IYFC practices. Result(s): The findings showed high household food insecurity as only 17.4% of the households were food secure. Infant feeding practices were inappropriate; 41% of the children attained a minimum dietary diversity; only 27% attained minimum acceptable diet and 76% attained minimum meal frequency. With the exception of the minimum meal frequency, adjusted logistic regression findings showed that infants living in food secure households were significantly more likely to achieve appropriate infant feeding practices than those in food insecure households: minimum meal frequency (AOR 1.26, p= 0.530); minimum dietary diversity (AOR 1.84, p= 0.046) and minimum acceptable diet (AOR 2.35, p= 0.008). Conclusion(s): The present study adds to the body of knowledge by showing how household food security relates to infant feeding practices in low-income settings. The findings imply that interventions aimed at improving infant feeding practices and ultimately nutritional status need to also focus on improving household food security.

N2  - Aim: To audit quality of consent with standards against the national consent policy (HSE, 2013) Methodology: This audit involved the retrospective review of the consent forms of 60 randomly selected patients who had a procedure or admission to Temple Street Children's University Hospital, in the period of 2013 to 2015. Patients were chosen randomly from the selection on-hold at the Healthcare Record's office. The tool consisted of 15 statements taken from the National Consent Policy (HSE, 2013). Each statement is a specific requirement for correct and legal consent to be established. Result(s): This audit result highlighted the quality of the consent documentation and process in TSCUH. There was record of obtained/refused consent with dates were present in the patient healthcare record was 98.3%. Consent documentation clearly identified service user by name (98.3%), Date of Birth (95%), Home address (88.5%), with healthcare identification number (95%). Consent documentation clearly identified the consent obtaining doctor's name (85.0%), Irish Medical Council's Number (IMC) (5.0%), Hospital bleep number (3.3%), clear signature (98.3%), and ajob title (81.7%). Only 68.3% cases consent documentation clearly stated the procedure/treatment/care involved and the risks and benefits of that procedure/treatment/care, where appropriate. Conclusion(s): The results of this audit highlighted that there is a need for some targeted, accurate documentation awareness and low-cost interventions, which could significantly improve consent process and documentation compli-ance rate since none of the consent forms in this audit were seen to comply fully with the National Consent Policy (HSE, 2013) guidelines. Recommendation: Add dedicated section to Consent Form for Doctor's IMC. Add dedicated section Consent Form for Doctor's Hospital Bleep Number. Remove "Grade" and replace with "Job title". Inform all incoming Doctors at hospital induction about the legal requirements for consent and requirement of compliance with the National Consent Policy (HSE, 2013).

N2  - Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the major bacterial pathogen causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) worldwide. There are limited data regarding the global burden and risk factors associated with drug-resistant S. pneumoniae (DRSP) in CAP patients. We assessed the prevalence and risk factors for DRSP-CAP in a multicentre, international point-prevalence study. Method(s): We enrolled adults (>18 years of age) hospitalized with CAP in a point-prevalence study from 222 hospitals across 54 countries worldwide. DRSP CAP was defined when a S. pneumoniae was documented resistant to at least one of the following antibodies: penicillin, macrolide, levofloxacin or tetracycline. The prevalence of DRSP-CAP was assessed by the identification of DRSP in blood or respiratory samples. We evaluated 64 potential risk factors to determine their relation with the infection by DRSP. Prevalence and risk factors were compared among patients with antibiotic driven therapy (i.e. patients in whom S. pneumoniae was isolated and the antibiogram was available) and patients with microbiology test performed. Result(s): 3,197 (86%) patients with microbiological testing performed were included in the study. Macrolide resistance was the most frequent patter identified in patients with DRSP-CAP (0.6%, 20/3197) followed by penicillin resistance (0.5%, 17/3197). The global prevalence of DRSP-CAP was 1.3% (41/3,197), 7.0% (9/128) in Africa, 1.2% (5/405) in Asia, 1.0% (2/203) in South America, 1.0% (20/1941) in Europe, and 1.0% (5/484) in North America. Patients enrolled in African participating centres were more likely to be infected with DRSP-CAP compared to participating centres in other continents (OR: 7.6; 95%CI: 3.34-15.35, p<0.001). The risk factors found to be independently associated with DRSP-CAP were healthcare workers (7.01; 2.00-24.5, p<0.001) and homeless patients (OR: 4.59; 1.12-18.8, p <0.001). Conclusion(s): This multinational point-prevalence study finds a low prevalence of DRSP-CAP, with important differences between continents and countries. Health care workers and homeless patients may be required according to the prevalence of DRSP in the community to be managed empirically against DRSP when hospitalized with CAP.

N2  - From monarchs, painters and philosophers to the lowly and homeless, the great mimic, syphilis, has rampaged through societies and nations throughout history. The World Health Organization recently named antibiotic-resistant sexually transmitted infections, including syphilis, which affects 5.6 million worldwide, a major public health problem. Recognizing the disease therefore remains a key skill for any dermatologist, now and historically. Many physicians throughout history dedicated their careers to the study of this disease. One such notable physician and eminent dermatologist was Professor Jean Alfred Fournier (1832-1914), whose many contributions have influenced modern dermatology. Fournier's passion for syphilis began under the influence of his mentor, Phillipe Ricord (1800-1889), who famously classified the nature of syphilis and separated it from other venereal diseases. Fournier described the features of congenital syphilis, alongside another of medical history's greatest figures, Sir Jonathan Hutchinson (1828-1913). Fournier's other great contribution was the recognition and the classification of tabes dorsalis, the parasyphilitic affliction, in the textbook L'Ataxie Locomotrice D'Origine Syphilitique (1882). He went on to describe many other dermatological conditions that are eponymous with his name. He was not only a brilliant physician and dermatologist, and Fournier's many publications also addressed the social aspect of syphilology. He was concerned with the social welfare of his afflicted patients and championed the cause of women and children innocently infected by syphilitic husbands. One of his many great works, 'Syphilis and Marriage' (1881), which was translated to English, discussed the role of the physician in what was a public health issue. He went on to become a founding father of many organizations including the French Society of Dermatology and Syphilology (1889) and the French Society for Sanitary and Moral Prevention (1901). His ideas concerning syphilis control were implemented in many European countries. His prophylactic efforts were recognized internationally and in 1902 he was made a Commander of the French Legion of Honour. Fournier's many publications were not only limited to clinical and social writings. He was also a medical historian, going on to translate and reproduce important historical works on syphilis from the 16th century by Giovanni da Vigo (1460-1525), Girolamo Fracastoro (1478-1553) and Jacques de Bethencourt (1477-c.1527). Many of Fournier's students took after their master and became notable figures in the history of dermatology, notably Darier and Wickham. As a testament to this great man, Darier (1856-1938), who himself has contributed to the field of dermatology, detailed his master's works in a reverential obituary article written in 1915.

T1  - Health disparities in LGB teen parents
T3  - 2017 CALDAR Summer Institute and International Conference Promoting Global Health. Los Angeles, CA United States.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Interventions to reduce pregnancy in adolescence have contributed to a reduction of such pregnancies in the last decade.When considering sexuality and teen pregnancy, lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adolescents experience considerably higher rates of pregnancy: 1 in 5 gay/bisexual males (18.6%) reported they had caused a pregnancy, compared to 11.8% of their heterosexual counterparts. Similarly, 1 in 4 lesbian/bisexual girls (25.0%) reported a history of one or more pregnancies compared to 21.9% of heterosexual girls. Interventions require an examination of sexuality and gender as important factors in adolescent pregnancy. Current scholarship is emerging in the field but has limitations. This preliminary research aims to identify gaps in current scholarship to understand population characteristics, propose interventions, and suggest resources for LGB adolescent parents. A literature review was conducted using multiple databases to identify relevant scholarship in teen pregnancy and LGB adolescents. Search keywords included: LGB teen parents and LGB adolescents. Given the limited research available, local resources were also included. Current literature indicates that LGB teen parents are more likely to engage in sexual risk behaviors, are at greater propensity of abusing substances, are at higher risk of becoming homeless, witness social impacts of stigma on their sexuality, and use pregnancy as a way to cope with their sexuality. The development of resources is needed to address the complex needs of LGB adolescent parents and their families. LGB adolescent families can benefit from comprehensive sexuality education to reduce risk behaviors and victimization. Further research should be conducted on characteristics, trends, and interventions targeting LGB adolescent mothers and fathers.

N2  - Aims The study examined knowledge and attitudes around Sexual Health (SH) and contraceptive use among Young People (YP) who are homelessness and resident in hostels in a large urban area and their key workers. The aim was to improve SH outcomes through building a model of SH care appropriate to the needs of YP. Less is known about SH in homeless young males' than females', thus the study aimed to ensure inclusion of male views. Methods A constructivist theoretical framework was used to underpin this qualitative ethnographic case study. The case under study being homeless YP, girls, boys or transgender, aged 16-21 years resident in homeless hostel accommodation. Participants were selected by purposive sampling in order to ensure maximum variety within the case. Twenty-nine homeless YP, and five key workers were recruited from homeless hostels and a homeless day-centre in a large urban area. One to one semi-structured interviews were carried out examining knowledge and attitudes concerning SH and contraceptive use. Insider observations of resident's meetings and the hostel and centre settings were undertaken. A reflexive approach was used in interviewing. Demographic data was collected from YP participants. Nvivo 10 QSR computer assisted software was used to analyse the data thematically, and demographic data used to stratify and identify trends between males, females and age groups. Results Four overarching themes were identified:. Meaning of sexual health:, Tended to differ between males and females, Females made associations with emotions, relationships and safety, Males with using protection, Life experiences have overriding effect on:, Attitudes, Sexual well-being., Being homeless poses risks and influences priority of SH:, Hygiene, Dangers, Survival, Use of SH services:, Barriers, Stigma and embarrassment, Staff attitudes Facilitators * Using non SH services e.g. GPs Conclusion Homeless YP resident in hostel accommodation require specialised delivery of SH care which is holistic and supports their needs. This could be provided within the familiar hostel or day-centre environment. It should be managed in a way that ensures facilitation of quality therapeutic relationships, with highly skilled workers, and sensitive dissemination of targeted information.

N2  - Background: Childhood malnutrition is associated with increased morbidity due to infectious diseases. Objective(s): A cluster randomized controlled cohort study was conducted to test whether an innovative feeding toolkit improves complementary feeding practices and infant growth. We additionally assessed the impacts of the intervention on morbidity. Method(s): 1,344 households in 3 traditional authorities in Mchinji District, Malawi with at least one child aged 6 to 17 months and whose caregiver participated in community women's groups were enrolled at baseline. In Oct/Nov 2015, community groups were randomized to either the intervention or control, with households in the intervention eligible to receive a toolkit consisting of a bowl with demarcations on age-appropriate meal volumes; a slotted spoon designed to promote optimal food consistency; and nutrition education. Caregivers in the control groups received nutrition education only. 963 households who participated at baseline and 67 additional households were followed up in Jun/Jul 2016 for a mixed methods endline evaluation including a household survey and focus group discussions. Logistic regression models, accounting for a clustering effect, were fitted to determine the impact of receiving the toolkit on morbidity outcomes. Result(s): At endline, the mean age of surveyed children (n=1030) was 21.4+/-3.37 months; 48% were male. Receipt of a toolkit was not associated with the odds of any reported illness in the previous 2 weeks (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.66, 1.30). However, receipt of a toolkit appears to be significantly associated with an increased odds of diarrhea (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.47) in the previous 2 weeks. Qualitative interviews with caregivers at endline indicated that food insecurity was a major barrier to utilization of the intervention toolkit and quantitative analyses revealed a significant interaction between receiving a toolkit and household food security on any illness in the previous 2 weeks (p=0.06). In stratified analyses, while the direction of the intervention effect differed between the two groups, receipt of a toolkit was not statistically significantly associated with the odds of any illness among food secure/mildly food insecure households (OR: 1.49, 95% CI: 0.81, 2.75) or food insecure households (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.52, 1.13). Those who both received a toolkit and were food secure/mildly food insecure had significantly reduced odds of any illness, compared to those who did not receive a toolkit and who were moderately/severely food insecure (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.36, 0.97). Conclusion(s): A feeding toolkit that cues appropriate complementary feeding practices may reduce all-cause morbidity, but effects appear to be modified by food security status. Larger sample sizes may be needed to further explore these relationships. Increased odds of diarrhea may be attributable to hygiene-related issues and merits further investigation.

N2  - Background: Inadequate complementary feeding (CF) is recognized as a cause of growth failure, but there is considerable variability in the ability of interventions to impact growth through CF practices. Objective(s): To evaluate the effectiveness of a feeding toolkit which aims to improve child growth through improved meal frequency, meal volume and food consistency in rural Malawi. Method(s): Households in Mchinji district, Malawi with a child aged 6 to 17 months were selected via single stage cluster sampling based on caregivers' participation in community women's groups; 923 households from 53 communities completed a baseline survey in July/August 2015 and an endline survey in June 2016. In October/November of 2015, women's groups were randomized to either the intervention or control, with households in intervention communities eligible to receive a feeding toolkit consisting of a feeding bowl with demarcations and symbols that cued age-appropriate meal frequency and volume; a slotted spoon designed to promote optimal porridge consistency; and nutrition education. Caregivers in the control groups received nutrition education. Logistic and linear regression was used to assess the impact of the feeding toolkit on CF practices and changes in child weight- and height-for-age (WAZ, HAZ) and weight-forheight (WHZ) z-scores adjusted for covariates. Result(s): The mean child age at endline was 21.3 +/- 3.3 months, with 51% female. Receipt of the toolkit was associated with increased meal volume (beta=30 ml, 95% CI 14 ml, 46 ml) but not with the odds of meeting minimum dietary diversity (P=0.6) or minimum acceptable diet (P=0.7). There was evidence of interaction between toolkit receipt and food security for minimum meal frequency (P=0.06) and consistency (P=0.07). The toolkit improved odds of minimum meal frequency (OR=1.55, 95% CI 1.10, 2.16) and was associated with increased meal thickness (beta=0.24, 95% CI 0.12, 0.36) but only among moderate or severely food insecure households. There was a trend toward improved HAZ in children who received the toolkit (beta=0.12, 95% CI=-0.01, 0.26, P = 0.07), but there were no associations with WAZ (P=0.6) or WHZ (P=0.3). Conclusion(s): A feeding bowl and spoon with nutrition education was associated with improved meal volume in all households, and improved meal frequency and consistency in the most food insecure households. Further studies are warranted to understand the impact of such an intervention on linear growth.

N2  - Food insecurity is very high in northern Ghana and the largest proportion of food insecure households is reported in Upper East region. The situation compounds high burden of malnutrition and notably endemic iron deficiency anemia which worsen during the prolonged dry season when staple nutrient-rich vegetables (e.g. Hibiscus sabdariffa), cereals and legumes/pulse are limited. Inhabitants are largely subsistent farmers of low socioeconomic status; consume monotonous diets consisting of staple cereals, vegetables and legumes with no or little animal products. The Upper East region has a typical savannah woodland vegetation characterized by short scattered drought-resistant trees and grass. It has two main seasons: a 7-8 mo dry season (October-April) and a 4-5 mo rainy season (May-September). We aimed to investigate the feasibility of producing widely consumed iron rich vegetables (Hibiscus sabdariffa) using container garden during the dry season to overcome limited irrigation capacity and access to land. We also investigated the feasibility of generating income to sustain the garden and purchasing micronutrient rich foods (dry fish and iodized salt). Fifty five women from a community based feeding trial were recruited in May 2016 and grouped by their respective communities for the garden containers: Sakaa (n=27) and Chania (n=28). Twenty containers/community were used for hibiscus sabdariffa production and 7 to 8 containers/community for income-generating cabbage production. Containers were assembled in the respective community health centers and fenced. Each community had a small plastic water reservoir for water drawn from a community borehole for watering of vegetables. Groups were given training on container gardening by an experienced gardener. We demonstrated two harvesting cycles (4 wks and 8 wks) for hibiscus sabdariffa and one cycle (14 wks) for cabbage. Hibiscus was harvested by 48 kg and 46 kg in Sakaa (mean 2.3kg of hibiscus/container/cycle) and 34 kg and 33 kg in Chania (mean 1.7 kg of hibiscus/container/cycle). Cabbage heads were harvested by 75 pieces (Sakaa) and 58 pieces (Chania) for marketing to pre-arranged buyers in food service sector and to the open markets. We found that one container is capable of providing motherchild dyad at least 3 hibiscus meals/week and income from one container for cabbage could meet dyad's monthly needs for iodize salt and fish consumption. The results suggest that the container garden would be able to provide hibiscus sabdariffa in the dry season, provide dietary iron and income adequate enough to purchase iodized salt and dry fish.

N2  - Homeless young adults are more likely than their never-homeless counterparts to abuse substances and engage in sexual risk behaviors, yet no brief interventions to simultaneously reduce these behaviors among this vulnerable population have been systematically designed and evaluated. This study evaluated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a smartphone application to self-monitor substance use and sexual risk behaviors plus a briefmotivational intervention (BMI) in reducing substance use and sexual risk behaviors among homeless young adults. A randomized pilot trial (N = 60) compared the smartphone application plus BMI to treatment as usual (TAU) at an inner-city crisis shelter for homeless young adults (18 to 21 years). Participants were assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks after baseline to evaluate alcohol consumption, marijuana use, sexual risk behaviors, and other relevant variables. Kruskal-Wallis tests, which account for the non-normal distribution of data, were performed to determine differences between baseline and postintervention assessments for the entire sample and by condition. Participants in the smartphone application plus BMI condition significantly reduced their past 2-week number of drinks (p = 0.023), times used marijuana (p = 0.046), times engaged in unprotected sex (p = 0.012), and times used drugs before sexual activity (p = 0.019) between baseline and post-intervention. No reductions of substance use or sexual risk behaviors were found among participants in the TAU condition (all ps>0.05). Findings from participant evaluations, collected at post-assessment, revealed that participants were highly satisfied with the overall quality, approach, and content of the smartphone application plus BMI. Though from a small sample, findings suggest that the smartphone application plus BMI is feasible and effective in reducing participant past 2-week substance use and sexual risk behaviors. Even if the smartphone application plus BMI proves to be somewhat less effective in terms of long-term behavior change than lengthy, more intensive approaches, the increased coverage fromease of dissemination, particularly with high risk individuals who are difficult to locate and retain, may eventually result in a larger overall public health effect.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Homeless smokers want to quit smoking but face numerous barriers to doing so, including a lack of social support and pervasive smoking in the setting of homelessness. Mobile phone possession is common among homeless people, and a short message service (SMS) could address challenges to smoking cessation in this population by providing homeless smokers with virtual support to manage ubiquitous social triggers to smoke. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of a freely available but underused stop-smoking SMS program on smoking abstinence among homeless smokers. METHOD(S): In 10/2015-06/2016, we conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a sequential mixed-methods design that used qualitative interviews to explain the quantitative results. Eligibility criteria included age >=18 years, current homelessness, current smoking (>=5 cigarettes/day), and desire to quit smoking in the next month. Control arm (N = 25) and SMS arm (N = 25) participants were offered nicotine patches, weekly in-person counseling, and a mobile phone. SMS arm participants additionally received help with enrolling in Smokefree TXT, a free service administered by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) that sends 1-5 SMS messages daily and offers on-demand tips for managing cravings, mood symptoms, and slips. The primary outcome was smoking abstinence, defined as an exhaled carbon monoxide <8 parts per million, assessed 14 times over 8 weeks of follow-up and analyzed using repeated-measures logistic regression with generalized estimating equations. The secondary outcomes were use of Smokefree TXT, assessed by data obtained from NCI; satisfaction with and appropriateness of Smokefree TXT, assessed by surveys and in-depth interviews; and mobile phone retention, assessed by self-report. RESULT(S): 67% of eligible individuals agreed to participate. Smoking abstinence did not differ significantly between arms at the end of treatment (SMS 16% vs. control 8%; p = 0.67) or averaged across all time points (SMS vs. control OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.30-2.84). 88%of SMS armparticipants enrolled in SmokefreeTXT; of these, 32% responded to >=1 interactive prompts sent by the program. Among SmokefreeTXT enrollees who completed exit surveys (N = 15), 67% were very or extremely satisfied with the program. However, qualitative interviews revealed that some participants felt the messages were "impersonal, like a robot." Several found the number of messages "overwhelming" and wanted "less texts a day." Others noted practical barriers to receiving the SMS messages, including limited phone battery life and lost or stolen phones. 40% of SMS arm participants retained their study-supplied mobile phone for the 8-week duration of the trial. CONCLUSION(S): SmokefreeTXT, when added to nicotine patch therapy and in-person counseling, did not improve smoking abstinence in this RCT of homeless smokers. SMS interventions for homeless smokers may need to be better tailored to their unique needs and combined with efforts to promote mobile phone retention.

N2  - STATEMENTOF PROBLEMORQUESTION(ONE SENTENCE): The opioid epidemic has brought significant morbidity and mortality, particularly among homeless individuals, but to our knowledge no shelter-based treatment for opioid addiction exists. OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREEOBJECTIVES): To evaluate the successes and challenges of a novel family shelter-based opioid treatment (SBOT) program in its first year. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT (E. G. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT, PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS): A family outreach team at our Community Health Center has treated patients facing homelessness in diverse settings since 1985. Between 6/2015-6/2016, the team took care of 669 adults and 405 children. Prevalence of OUD in our patients during that time was 6%. Office-Based Opioid Therapy (OBOT) works for homeless adults as well as it does for housed adults. But homeless adults in families have unique barriers to OBOT including transportation and childcare needs. Our team of a physician, a nurse, case managers, and a therapist works in a twice-a-week outreach clinic at a 120-room family motel-shelter and regularly encounters patients with opioid use disorder. In 2015, our team developed SBOT. Features of SBOT include on-site induction, weekly group or individual therapy, regular urine drug testing and medication counts, intranasal naloxone training, medication lockboxes, and employment, housing and family support. MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVE METRICS WHICH WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE PROGRAM/INTERVENTION): We reviewed the charts of patients who started SBOT from 8/2015 to 8/2016. We reported patient demographics and co-morbidities. We used Chi-squared tests to compare overdose history, urine drug test results, and employment at the beginning of and during treatment. We also reported reason for leaving the program. FINDINGS TODATE (IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TOSTATE FINDINGS WILL BE DISCUSSED): We started 10 patients on SBOT in our first year. Six were women and 6 reported white race. Mean age was 35 (range 32-40) and median number of children was 2 (range 1-5). Thirty percent had a history of illicit oral opioid use only, 20% had a history of heroin use only, and 50% had a history of both. Half tested positive for hepatitis C and none for HIV. All had anxiety and 70% had depression or bipolar disorder. Mean time in SBOT was 7.4 months (range 3-12 months). Four patients had experienced overdose before SBOT, but none did during SBOT (P < 0.01). In the first month of treatment, 77% of urine drug tests showed controlled substances, compared to 51% in the third month (P < 0.01). In their final month of treatment, 3 patients reported being employed, compared to 1 at the beginning (P = 0.04). After the review period, 4 continued SBOT, 5 moved out of the shelter and transferred care elsewhere, and 1 left the motel and did not continue agonist therapy. Two patients relapsed after leaving the shelter and lost custody of their children. KEYLESSONS FORDISSEMINATION(WHATCAN OTHERS TAKE AWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO THEIR PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY?): Shelter-based opioid treatment-SBOT-helped a diverse group of vulnerable adults access treatment. An inter-professional team and the ability to send labs contributed to our success. A significant challenge was transitioning care once patients left the shelter-access to OBOT in the community is limited, and requires solving transportation, childcare and other issues SBOT helped patients overcome.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The homeless population is aging. As people age, their symptom burden often increases. Higher symptom burden is associated with functional impairment, healthcare utilization, and mortality. We describe the prevalence of symptoms in older homeless adults, analyze factors associated with higher somatic symptom burden, and identify symptom clusters. METHOD(S): HOPE HOME is a 3-year prospective cohort study of 350 homeless adults aged 50 and older, recruited using population-based sampling. Trained interviewers asked about demographic information, physical and mental health, and health-related behaviors. At the 18-month or, if missed, next-attended follow-up interview, we administered the Patient Health Questionnaire 15 (PHQ-15) to measure somatic symptoms and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Screening (CES-D), Primary Care Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Screen (PC-PTSD), and the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) to measure psychological symptoms. We determined loneliness or social symptoms using the 3-item Loneliness Scale and regret or existential symptoms using a 6-item regret scale. We examined symptom prevalence and severity, determined factors associated with moderate-high somatic symptom burden (PHQ-15 >= 10) using multivariate logistic analysis, and identified symptom clusters using cluster analyses. RESULT(S): 283 participants completed symptom interviews; 24.4% were female, 82.3% were African American, 41.3% were homeless at time of follow-up interview, and 49.5% had 2 ormore chronic conditions (multi-morbidity). Over a third (34.0%) of participants had moderate-high symptom burden. The most prevalent somatic symptoms were joint pain (65.4%), fatigue (65.2%), back pain (59.0%), and sleep trouble (46.5%). Over half (57.6%) of participants had psychological symptoms; 47.0% reported depression and 36.0% reported anxiety. Over a third (38.2%) of participants were lonely and a quarter (24.7%) had high regret scores. In a multivariate model, anxiety (AOR 5.86, 95% CI 3.02- 11.39), cannabis use (AOR 2.94, 95% CI 1.51-5.75), multi-morbidity (AOR 2.86, 95% CI 1.52-5.38), female sex (AOR 2.32, 95% CI 1.13-4.75), childhood abuse (AOR 2.09, 95% CI 1.09-4.00), recent abuse (AOR 1.98, 95% CI 1.05- 3.72), and inadequate health literacy (AOR 1.38, 95% CI 1.08-1.77) were associated with moderate-high somatic symptom burden. We identified 4 symptom clusters: minimal overall symptoms, moderate overall symptoms, high somatic and high psychological symptoms, and high somatic and low psychological symptoms. There was no cluster with psychological symptoms only. CONCLUSION(S): Older homeless adults have a higher prevalence of symptomatology than general population adults aged 20 years older. High somatic symptom burden is associated with physical, mental, and behavioral health factors. Understanding symptom burden may help in designing appropriate, multi-disciplinary health interventions for older homeless populations.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Three-quarters of homeless adults smoke cigarettes, contributing to 3- to 5-fold higher rates of tobacco-attributable mortality compared with the general population. Homeless smokers want to quit smoking, but the proportion who are able to do so is one-fifth the national average and studies of conventional treatment approaches have yielded modest results. Financial incentives for smoking abstinence have shown promise in non-experimental studies of homeless smokers, but randomized trial data are lacking in this population. We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial of financial incentives for smoking abstinence among homeless smokers in Boston, MA. METHOD(S): All study procedures occurred between October 2015 and June 2016 at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program. Eligibility criteria included age >=18 years, current smoking (>=5 cigarettes/day, >=100 cigarettes lifetime), current homelessness, and desire to quit smoking in the next month. Individuals were not excluded for current drug or alcohol use. Participants randomized to the financial incentives arm (N = 25) could earn escalating monetary rewards ($15-$35) for carbon monoxide (CO)-defined smoking abstinence (<8 parts per million [ppm]), assessed 14 times over 8 weeks. Control arm participants (N = 25) were given $10 at each assessment visit, regardless of their exhaled CO levels. All study payments were made onto reloadable debit cards issued to each participant at enrollment. Participants in both arms were offered nicotine patches and weekly behavioral counseling. The primary outcome was a repeated measure of point-in-time smoking abstinence (CO <8 ppm) across the 14 study visits. The secondary outcome was point-in-time abstinence at 8 weeks. Exploratory smoking outcomes were self-reported past 1-day and 7-day abstinence from 1) any cigarette and 2) any puff of a cigarette. Other outcomes included quit attempts, nicotine patch use, counseling attendance, and changes in alcohol and drug use severity scores. RESULT(S): Compared with control arm participants, financial incentive arm participants had greater point-in-time abstinence overall (OR 7.28, 95% CI 2.89, 18.3) and at the end of treatment (48.0% vs. 8%, p = 0.004). Similar effects were seen for past 1-day abstinence, but the rates of past 7-day puff abstinence were negligible (0-4%) in both arms. Incentive arm participants made significantly more past-month quit attempts at 4 weeks (p = 0.03). Nicotine patch use (p = 0.80) and counseling attendance (p = 0.43) did not differ significantly between groups. There were no significant changes in alcohol or drug use severity scores in either group. CONCLUSION(S): Among homeless smokers, financial incentives increased brief smoking abstinence and quit attempts without worsening substance use. This approach is promising but requires modification to achieve more sustained smoking abstinence in this vulnerable population.

T1  - Pulmonary hemosiderosis caused by cocaine inhalation-An under reported complication of a commonly abused drug

N2  - Background: Cocaine, also known as benzoylmethylecgonine or coke, is a strong stimulant mostly used as a recreational drug. It is commonly snorted, inhaled, or injected into the veins. Mental effects may include loss of contact with reality, an intense feeling of happiness, or agitation. Physical effects are secondary to powerful stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system by inhibiting catecholamine reuptake, stimulating central sympathetic outflow, and increasing the sensitivity of adrenaline nerve endings to norepinephrine (NE). They include a fast heart rate, sweating, and large pupils. Cocaine is the 5th most common substance of abuse. In 2014, the estimate of about 1.5 million people aged 12 or older who were current users of cocaine included about 354,000 current users of Crack cocaine (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015) [1] . Data from the 2011 Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) report showed that cocaine was involved in 505,224 of the nearly 1.3 million visits to emergency departments for drug misuse or abuse. This translates to over one in three drug misuse or abuse-related emergency department visits (40 percent) that involved cocaine, making it the most common drug use leading to ED use. Common reasons include cardiovascular effects, including disturbances in heart rhythm and heart attacks; neurological effects, including headaches, seizures, strokes, and coma; and gastrointestinal complications, including abdominal pain and nausea. Pulmonary and renal effects of acute and long term cocaine use have also been described, though less frequently. Bailey et al. in 1994 have done a pathological study. The authors stated that 58% cocaine abuse group had acute alveolar hemorrhage (Bailey, Fraire, Greenberg, Barnard, & Cagle, 1994). Their Study demonstrated that demonstrate that pulmonary hemorrhage is more frequent than suggested by clinical hemoptysis and that chronic pulmonary diseases such as interstitial fibrosis may develop in long-term users. Bailey et al. in 2002 demonstrated through a prospective study that the alveolar macrophages containing hemosiderin and Endothelin levels were elevated in cocaine smoking group compared to non-cocaine smoking and tobacco smoking groups (Baldwin et al. 2002). The authors stated that there was a correlation between endothelin levels and alveolar macrophage positive for hemosiderin. Itkonen (Itkonen, Schnoll, & Glassroth, 1984) stated that 58% of cocaine users have a diffusion capacity of lungs less than 70% of predicted value. Clinicians are often unaware of these effects which may have a significant impact on presentation and treatment. Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality.(2015).

Method(s): We describe a case of Pulmonary Hemosiderosis secondary to chronic cocaine use in a 53 y/o Homeless African American Male with a Past Medical History of HTN, Anemia, COPD and Cocaine use Disorder. He presented to the ER with complaints of progressively worsening Shortness of Breath and cough of over 2 weeks duration. Clinical presentation, Inpatient course and work up are described. Result(s): The patient was diagnosed to have Pulmonary Hemosiderosis with secondary Hemoptysis and Anemia due to chronic cocaine use. The patient received a through clinical, hematological, radio-logical and histo-pathological work up to confirm the diagnosis, as described in clinical summery. Conclusion(s): Pulmonary effects of acute and long term cocaine use have also been described in literature, though less frequently. The Up to 58% cocaine abuse group has been reported to experience acute alveolar hemorrhage (Bailey et al. 1994). Their Study demonstrated that demonstrate that pulmonary hemorrhage is more frequent than suggested by clinical hemoptysis and that chronic pulmonary diseases such as interstitial fibrosis may develop in long-term users. A prospective study by Baldwin et al. (2002) demonstrated that the alveolar macrophages containing hemosiderin and Endothelin levels were elevated in cocaine smoking group compared to non-cocaine smoking and tobacco smoking groups. As per study by Itkonen (1984), 58% of cocaine users have a diffusion capacity of lungs less than 70% of predicted value. Clinicians are often unaware of these effects which may have a significant impact on presentation and treatment, as well as counseling of the patients with Cocaine Use Disorder. Summary: We describe a case of Pulmonary Hemosiderosis secondary to chronic cocaine use in a 53 y/o Homeless AAM, DC Native with a Past Medical History of Hypertensoin, Anemia, COPD and Cocaine use Disorder (>30 years). He presented to the ER with complaints of progressively worsening Shortness of Breath and cough of over 2 weeks duration. Cough was associated with sputum containing small blood clots. He complained of 8/10 intensity Chest pain, located in the center of the chest, worsening with movement and coughing and getting better on lying down. No Nausea, Vomiting or diarrhea reported. There was no history of night sweats, TB Exposure or recent hospitalization, though subjective history of fever was noted. The client reported similar presentation 5-6 months ago, reported having possibly given blood but no documented history was obtained. He had no Primary Care Doctor and no regular medication. He denied any allergies. He reported smoking 1/2 PPD for 30-40 years. He also endorsed 3-4 times per week cocaine use (Approx. 1.2 gram per session) for past 30 years, his drug of choice through inhalation route; with last use day before presentation. He quit alcohol 30 years ago. No history of recent travel. Work-up revealed severe Anemia with labs (2.5 mg%, Low MCHC, MVC and High RDW) and evidence of physiological adaptation suggesting chronic blood loss. Liver and renal function mildly compromised. UDS positive for Cocaine. Chest X ray showed B/L diffuse ground glass appearance. The client needed to be stabilized with PRBC transfusions, and further work up was carried out to R/O GI bleeding. CT of the Chest was done which showed diffuse extensive ground glass infiltrates of the lower lobes. No hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy and no lesions suspecting malignancy. CT Abdomen and Pelvis had ruled out malignant lesions and lymphadenopathy. HIV Screening test was negative. Pneumonia work up including Urine for streptococcal pneumonia antigen, legionella antigen, Serum mycoplasma antigen was negative. Tuberculosis was ruled out after 3 sets of sputum samples were negative for Acid Fast Bacilli. Hepatitis Panel was negative. Anti-Nuclear antibody, Anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were negative; Complement testing and Protein Electrophoresis were normal ruling out autoimmune pathology. Serum Iron was low [31 mcg/dl (65-175)] Total Iron Binding Capacity upper normal [309 mcg/dl (25-450)], Ferritin 94.6 mcg (26-388). Normal Alfa-Feto Protein, CEA, CA, PSA ruled out Malignancy. Vit. B12, Folate was normal. No thyroid abnormality. Endoscopic Gastro duodenoscopy showed Gastritis and Colonoscopy showed small external and internal hemorrhoids. The laboratory results suggested only one possible explanation for severe anemia and the cause of hemoptysis to be related to cocaine inhalation. Lung biopsy was done which showed pulmonary hemosiderosis with no evidence suggesting malignancy or vasculitis. Patient was diagnosed with alveolar hemorrhage leading to pulmonary hemosiderosis caused by cocaine inhalation. Implications for Clinical Practice/Education/Policy: Review of Literature suggests that very high percentage of cocaine users, particularly in crack users both acute and chronic; through inhalation route develop pulmonary hemosiderosis and hemoptysis. The Hemoptysis may not be clinically apparent or significant, but over a period of time may still lead to complications like pulmonary fibrosis with loss of diffusion capacity in well over half of the users. The pulmonary complications of cocaine use are common but under-reported in literature, possibly reflecting less than optimal clinical awareness and clinical management, and also possible under-treatment which may have negative outcome on patients with cocaine use disorder. As the pulmonary complications of cocaine use are very common, it may be beneficial to routinely include cursory history of pulmonary symptoms in psychiatric history taking/initial counseling encounters, as well as inform the patients about possible signs and symptoms to look for as they may not be always clinically apparent or significant in initial stages.

N2  - Suicide is a significant public health issue, especially among people who use illicit drugs. In the present study, we prospectively assess the incidence and predictors of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA) over a oneyear period in 868 substance-using patients in seven public, safety-net, primary care clinics in King County, Washington. Participants who used illicit drugs or non-prescribed medications within the past 90 days completed baseline measures assessing demographics, psychiatric symptoms, substance use, psychosocial stressors, treatment service utilization, health-related quality of life, past-month SI, and lifetime SA. SI and SA were then assessed 3, 6, 9, and 12 months later. Participants endorsed high rates of SI (25.9%) and SA (7.1%) during the one-year follow-up. Several baseline variables were associated with subsequent SI and SA. In multivariable analyses that controlled for other risk factors, only past 30-day SI, any lifetime SA, violent behavior, and impairment due to anxiety or depression uniquely predicted SI or SA beyond other variables (ORs=1.78 to 6.05). Primary care providers may be in key positions to screen and intervene with suicidal, substance-using patients. Among these patients, those with recent SI, any lifetime SA, functionally impairing depression or anxiety, or violent behavior may particularly benefit from increased suicide assessment and intervention. Over 40,000 people die annually from suicide in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015), and suicide risk is 10 to 14 times higher among individuals who use substances compared to those who do not (Yuodelis-Flores & Ries, 2015). Primary care providers are in unique positions to assess and address suicidality and substance use, as individuals who use substances or attempt suicide are more likely to interact with primary care providers than with specialty mental health or addiction treatment services (Luoma et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2005). While previous studies have identified risk factors associated with subsequent suicidality in the general population, fewer studies have examined risk factors specifically within substance-using populations, and no studies have identified which risk factors prospectively predict suicidal ideation or attempt among substance users in primary care. Method(s): The present study assessed the incidence and predictors of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA) over a one-year period after substance-using individuals were seen in primary care clinics. Participants (N=868) were recruited from waiting rooms of seven safety-net primary care clinics in King County, Washington State. All participants were 18 years or older, used an illegal drug or non-prescribed medication in the 90 days prior to screening, and planned to continue receiving care at the clinic. Participants were excluded if they engaged in formal substance abuse treatment in the past month or reported imminent suicidality at baseline. Baseline measures assessed past-month use of alcohol and various classes of drugs, psychiatric symptoms, psychosocial stressors, employment status, housing status, pending legal charges, treatment service utilization, health-related quality of life, past 30-day SI, and lifetime SA. At 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after baseline, past-month SI and any SA since the previous assessment were re-assessed. One-year incidences of SI and SA were estimated as the proportion of participants endorsing SI or SA in at least one follow-up. Univariate logistic regression was then used to identify which patient characteristics were associated with increased risk of subsequent SI and SA. Multivariable logistic regression was then used to identify which variables predicted subsequent SI and SA after accounting for other risk factors. Result(s): Baseline demographics indicated that participants were predominantly male, largely unmarried, unemployed, and receiving welfare benefits, and almost a third of the sample reported homelessness in the last 90 days. Rates of psychiatric symptoms and non-psychiatric medical treatment utilization were high. Over the one-year follow-up, 25.9% of participants endorsed SI on at least one occasion (95% CI: 22.8-29.3%), and 7.1% (95% CI: 6.0-9.9%) endorsed at least one SA. Several baseline variables had univariate associations with SI and SA, including younger age, female gender, lacking high school education, unemployment, psychiatric symptoms, previous SI or SA at baseline, stimulant use, nicotine use, heavier drug-use involvement, emergency and outpatient psychiatric treatment utilization, and lower health-related quality of life. However, after controlling for other risk factors in multivariable regression models, fewer risk-factors remained significant. Specifically, only baseline depression and anxiety symptoms, past 30-day SI, and any lifetime SA predicted subsequent SI, and only baseline violent behavior, past 30-day SI, and any lifetime SA predicted subsequent SA. Conclusion(s): One-year incidence of SI and SA were markedly higher in this sample (25.9% and 7.1%, respectively) compared to one- year incidence in the general population (3.7% and 0.5%, respectively; Crosby et al., 2011). Primary care patients who use substances may be at considerably higher risk for suicidality, but it should also be noted that the present sample had a substantial degree of homelessness, unemployment, psychiatric, and medical problems that may also increase suicide risk. Primary care providers have unique opportunities to intervene with both substance use and suicidality (Office of the Surgeon General, 2012), and these problems commonly co-occur. When working with individuals who use substances, primary care providers are advised to screen for risk factors of SI and SA, including any lifetime SA, recent SI, difficulty with violent behavior, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Educational objectives: At the conclusion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Recall one-year incidence rates of suicide attempt in substance using primary-care patients 2. List three risk factors for suicide attempt and ideation in drug-using primary care patients 3. Summarize recommendations for suicide risk screening with primary care drug-using patients.

N2  - Little is known about pregnancy in underhoused women, possibly because the number of underhoused mothers with babies in Toronto has been significantly underestimated. Using a novel data collection method, it has been found that there are approximately 300 babies being born each year to underhoused women in Toronto. This finding has significant public health implications, as these women are at increased risk of multiple issues related to physical health, mental health, child protection, poverty and safety. This commentary presents a new data collection strategy, highlights the importance of accurate data collection and offers suggestions for supports for this over-looked population.Copyright © The Author 2017.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Homeless female ex-offenders (homeless female offenders) exiting jail and prison are at a critical juncture during reentry and transitioning into the community setting., OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to compare the effect of a dialectical behavioral therapy-case management (DBT-CM) program with a health promotion (HP) program on achieving drug and alcohol abstinence among female parolees/probationers residing in the community., METHODS: We conducted a multicenter parallel randomized controlled trial with 130 female parolees/probationers (aged 19-64 years) residing in the community randomly assigned to either DBT-CM (n = 65) or HP (n = 65). The trial was conducted in four community-based partner sites in Los Angeles and Pomona, California, from February 2015 to November 2016. Treatment assignment was carried out using a computer-based urn randomization program. The primary outcome was drug and alcohol use abstinence at 6-month follow up., RESULTS: Analysis was based on data from 116 participants with complete outcome data. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that the DBT-CM program remained an independent positive predictor of decrease in drug use among the DBT-CM participants at 6 months (p = .01) as compared with the HP program participants. Being non-White (p < .05) and having higher depressive symptom scores (p < .05) were associated with lower odds of drug use abstinence (i.e., increased the odds of drug use) at 6 months., DISCUSSION: DBT-CM increased drug and alcohol abstinence at 6-month follow-up, compared to an HP program.

N2  - Homeless youth have high rates of substance use and often lack connection to social services. Outreach is critical for connecting youth to services, but factors influencing their outreach engagement are unknown. This study examined predictors of meetings with outreach workers among 79 non-service connected, substance using homeless youth between 14 and 24 years of age. Results provide direction to service providers in that older age, higher levels of depressive symptoms, fewer drug-related problems, and no use of hard drugs within the prior 30 days predicted higher meeting attendance. Future research is needed testing strategies that overcome barriers to outreach engagement.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Women who inject drugs and who also exchange sex are at increased risk for HIV infection, but data on this population in the United States remain sparse., METHODS: This study assessed the prevalence of exchanging sex for money or drugs among women who inject drugs using data from the 2009 US National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) system. Prevalence of being HIV-positive (testing positive in NHBS), HIV-positive-unaware (reporting being HIV-negative or unknown status but testing positive in NHBS), and risk behaviors and use of services were compared between women who did and did not exchange sex. The association between exchange sex and being HIV-positive-unaware of the infection was examined using multivariate Poisson models with robust standard errors., RESULTS: Among 2305 women who inject drugs, 39% reported receiving things like money or drugs from >=1 male partners in exchange for oral, vaginal, or anal sex in the previous 12 months. Women who exchanged sex were more likely to be unemployed, homeless, lack health insurance, have multiple condomless vaginal or anal sex partners, and receptively share syringes. In multivariate analysis, exchange sex was associated with being HIV-positive-unaware (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.97, 95% confidence intervals: 1.31 to 2.97)., CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of exchange sex was high in this population. Women who exchange sex were more likely to be socially disadvantaged, report sexual and injection risk, and be HIV-positive-unaware. They represent an important group to reach with HIV prevention, testing, and care services.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC are geographically proximate cities with high HIV prevalence, including among black men who have sex with men (BMSM). Using data collected among BMSM in CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance project, we compared socio-demographic characteristics, HIV risk behaviors, and service utilization to explore similarities and differences that could inform local and regional HIV intervention approaches., METHODS: BMSM were recruited through venue time location sampling, June-December, 2011. Participants completed identical socio-behavioral surveys and voluntary HIV testing. Analyses were conducted among the full sample and those aged 18-24., FINDINGS: Participants included 159 (DC), 364 (Baltimore), and 331 (Philadelphia) eligible BMSM. HIV prevalence was 23.1% (DC), 48.0% (Baltimore), 14.6% (Philadelphia) with 30.6%, 69.0%, 33.3% unrecognized HIV infection, respectively. Among BMSM 18-24, HIV prevalence was 11.1% (DC), 38.9% (Baltimore), 9.6% (Philadelphia) with unrecognized HIV infection 0.0%, 73.8%, 60.0% respectively. Compared with the other 2 cities, Baltimore participants were less likely to identify as gay/homosexual; more likely to report unemployment, incarceration, homelessness, sex exchange; and least likely to use the internet for partners. DC participants were more likely to have a college degree and employment. Philadelphia participants were more likely to report gay/homosexual identity, receptive condomless anal sex, having only main partners, and bars/clubs as partner meeting places. Sexually transmitted disease testing was universally low., CONCLUSIONS: Analyses showed especially high HIV prevalence among BMSM in Baltimore including among young BMSM. Socio-demographic characteristics and HIV infection correlates differed across cities but unrecognized HIV infection and unknown partner status were universally high.

N2  - PURPOSE: HIV prevalence estimates among transgender women in the United States are high, particularly among racial/ethnic minorities. Despite increased HIV risk and evidence of racial disparities in HIV prevalence among transgender women, few data are available to inform HIV prevention efforts., METHODS: A transgender HIV-related behavioral survey conducted in 2009 in 3 US metropolitan areas (Chicago, Houston, and Los Angeles County), used respondent-driven sampling to recruit 227 black (n = 139) and Latina (n = 88) transgender women. We present descriptive statistics on sociodemographic, health care, and HIV-risk behaviors., RESULTS: Of 227 transgender women enrolled, most were economically and socially disadvantaged: 73% had an annual income of less than $15,000; 62% lacked health insurance; 61% were unemployed; and 46% reported being homeless in the past 12 months. Most (80%) had visited a health care provider and over half (58%) had tested for HIV in the past 12 months. Twenty-nine percent of those who reported having an HIV test in the past 24 months self-reported being HIV positive. Most of the sample reported hormone use (67%) in the past 12 months and most hormone use was under clinical supervision (70%). Forty-nine percent reported condomless anal sex in the past 12 months and 16% reported ever injecting drugs., CONCLUSION: These findings reveal the socioeconomic challenges and behavioral risks often associated with high HIV risk reported by black and Latina transgender women. Despite low health insurance coverage, the results suggest opportunities to engage transgender women in HIV prevention and care given their high reported frequency of accessing health care providers.

T1  - Developmental nicotine exposure alters potassium currents in hypoglossal motoneurons of neonatal rat

N2  - We previously showed that nicotine exposure in utero and after birth via breast milk [developmental nicotine exposure (DNE)] is associated with many changes in the structure and function of hypoglossal motoneurons (XIIMNs), including a reduction in the size of the dendritic arbor and an increase in cell excitability. Interestingly, the elevated excitability was associated with a reduction in the expression of glutamate receptors on the cell body. Together, these observations are consistent with a homeostatic compensation aimed at restoring cell excitability. Compensation for increased cell excitability could also occur by changing potassium conductance, which plays a critical role in regulating resting potential, spike threshold, and repetitive spiking behavior. Here we test the hypothesis that the previously observed increase in the excitability of XIIMNs from DNE animals is associated with an increase in whole cell potassium currents. Potassium currents were measured in XIIMNs in brain stem slices derived from DNE and control rat pups ranging in age from 0 to 4 days by whole cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. All currents were measured after blockade of action potential-dependent synaptic transmission with tetrodotoxin. Compared with control cells, XIIMNs from DNE animals showed significantly larger transient and sustained potassium currents, but this was observed only under conditions of increased cell and network excitability, which we evoked by raising extracellular potassium from 3 to 9 mM. These observations suggest that the larger potassium currents in nicotine-exposed neurons are an important homeostatic compensation that prevents "runaway" excitability under stressful conditions, when neurons are receiving elevated excitatory synaptic input. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Developmental nicotine exposure is associated with increased cell excitability, which is often accompanied by compensatory changes aimed at normalizing excitability. Here we show that whole cell potassium currents are also increased in hypoglossal motoneurons from nicotine-exposed neonatal rats under conditions of increased cell and network excitability. This is consistent with a compensatory response aimed at preventing instability under conditions in which excitatory synaptic input is high and is compatible with the concept of homeostatic plasticity.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.

This study was conducted with the aim of assessing associations of women's autonomy and men's involvement with child anthropometric indices in cash crop livelihood areas of South West Ethiopia. Methods Multi-stage stratified sampling was used to select 749 farming households living in three coffee producing sub-districts of Jimma zone, Ethiopia. Domains of women's Autonomy were measured by a tool adapted from demographic health survey. A model for determination of paternal involvement in childcare was employed. Caring practices were assessed through the WHO Infant and young child feeding practice core indicators. Length and weight measurements were taken in duplicate using standard techniques. Data were analyzed using SPSS for windows version 21. A multivariable linear regression was used to predict weight for height Z-scores and length for age Z-scores after adjusting for various factors. Results The mean (sd) scores of weight for age (WAZ), height for age (HAZ), weight for height (WHZ) and BMI for age (BAZ) was -0.52(1.26), -0.73(1.43), -0.13(1.34) and -0.1(1.39) respectively. The results of multi variable linear regression analyses showed that WHZ scores of children of mothers who had autonomy of conducting big purchase were higher by 0.42 compared to children's whose mothers had not. In addition, a child whose father was involved in childcare and feeding had higher HAZ score by 0.1. Regarding age, as for every month increase in age of child, a 0.04 point decrease in HAZ score and a 0.01 point decrease in WHZ were noted. Similarly, a child living in food insecure households had lower HAZ score by 0.29 compared to child of food secured households. As family size increased by a person a WHZ score of a child is decreased by 0.08. WHZ and HAZ scores of male child was found lower by 0.25 and 0.38 respectively compared to a female child of same age. Conclusion Women's autonomy and men's involvement appeared in tandem with better child anthropometric outcomes. Nutrition interventions in such setting should integrate enhancing women's autonomy over resource and men's involvement in childcare and feeding, in addition to food security measures.Copyright © 2017 Abate, Belachew.

N2  - Endogenous extracellular adenosine level fluctuates in an activity-dependent manner and with sleep-wake cycle, modulating synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity. Hebbian-type long-term plasticity introduces intrinsic positive feedback on synaptic weight changes, making them prone to runaway dynamics. We previously demonstrated that co-occurring, weight-dependent heterosynaptic plasticity can robustly prevent runaway dynamics. Here we show that at neocortical synapses in slices from rat visual cortex, adenosine modulates the weight dependence of heterosynaptic plasticity: blockade of adenosine A1 receptors abolished weight dependence, while increased adenosine level strengthened it. Using model simulations, we found that the strength of weight dependence determines the ability of heterosynaptic plasticity to prevent runaway dynamics of synaptic weights imposed by Hebbian-type learning. Changing the weight dependence of heterosynaptic plasticity within an experimentally observed range gradually shifted the operating point of neurons between an unbalancing regime dominated by associative plasticity and a homeostatic regime of tightly constrained synaptic changes. Because adenosine tone is a natural correlate of activity level (activity increases adenosine tone) and brain state (elevated adenosine tone increases sleep pressure), modulation of heterosynaptic plasticity by adenosine represents an endogenous mechanism that translates changes of the brain state into a shift of the regime of synaptic plasticity and learning. We speculate that adenosine modulation may provide a mechanism for fine-tuning of plasticity and learning according to brain state and activity.Copyright © 2017 the authors.

N2  - Background: 'Almajiris' are children and adolescents sent far away from their homes to study in Islamic schools under the care of Muslim scholars. Over the years, there has been a decline in the capacity of the scholars to cater to these pupils. Consequently, Almajiris spend significant periods of time on the streets begging and carrying out menial jobs to earn a living thereby increasing their risk for physical and mental disorders. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among Almajiris and public primary school pupils in Zaria. Method(s): A comparative cross-sectional design was utilized to compare 213 Almajiris and 200 public primary school children and adolescents aged between 5 and 19 years. All participants were administered a Socio-demographic questionnaire and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-aged Children Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL). Data were analyzed using Chi square tests and logistic regression. Result(s): The current prevalence of psychiatric disorders among Almajiris and public school pupils was 57.7 and 37.0% respectively. After adjusting for age and family characteristics, Almajiris were significantly more likely to have any psychiatric diagnosis, depression, enuresis, substance use, and post traumatic stress disorder but less likely to have separation anxiety disorder than the public school pupils. Conclusion(s): Psychiatric disorders are more prevalent among Almajiris and public primary school pupils in Northwest Nigeria than found in other prevalence studies with a significantly higher rate among the Almajiris. Joint efforts need to be made by the Government and Civil Society organizations including religious groups towards reforming the Almajiri education system and the provision of programmes aimed at reducing the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in both Almajiris and the school pupils.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

N2  - Female homeless youths are vulnerable to risky sex and substance use behaviors, yet they have strengths known as psychological capital. A quasi-experimental pre-post research design with repeated measures was used to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a brief intervention to enhance psychological capital, reduce health-risk behaviors, and achieve short-term behavioral goals. Study participants were 80 ethnically diverse homeless women between the ages of 18 and 23 years. Intervention participants had significant improvements in psychological capital, hope, resilience, and self-efficacy to refuse alcohol, social connectedness, and substance use ( p < .05). There was a significant group by time interaction for safe sex self-efficacy; intervention participants had greater self-confidence in negotiating safer sex practices than comparison participants. At the follow-up post-test, 82% of intervention participants who remained in the study had met or exceeded their short-term goals. This brief, street-based intervention was feasible and showed preliminary efficacy.

N2  - Some criminal defendants with mental illness may not be referred to traditional mental health jail diversion programs because they have a history of non-compliance with treatment, or complex personal circumstances such as homelessness. To successfully divert such individuals, Connecticut has developed a specialized program called the Advanced Supervision and Intervention Support Team (ASIST), which offers criminal justice supervision in conjunction with mental health treatment and support services. An evaluation of the ASIST program included a six-month follow-up study of 111 program clients to examine mental health functioning and other outcomes, and a comparison of administrative data for 492 ASIST clients with a propensity-matched group to examine recidivism. Follow-up study clients showed improvements in mental health. Administrative data showed no change in arrest rates, but a significant reduction in re-incarceration. These findings must be viewed with caution due to the quasi-experimental design of the study, but it appears that greater attention to criminogenic needs in addition to defendants' mental illness may help jurisdictions to divert a wider variety of defendants.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although the initiation of injection drug use has been well characterized among at-risk youth, factors that support or impede cessation of injection drug use have received less attention. We sought to identify socioeconomic factors associated with cessation of injection drug use among street-involved youth., METHODS: From September 2005 to May 2015, data were collected from the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), a prospective cohort study of street-involved youth in Vancouver, Canada. Multivariate extended Cox regression was utilized to identify socioeconomic factors associated with cessation of injection drug use for six months or longer among youth who were actively injecting., RESULTS: Among 383 participants, 171 (44.6%) youth reported having ceased injection (crude incidence density 22 per 100 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 19-26) at some point during study follow-up. Youth who had recently dealt drugs (adjusted hazard ration [AHR], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.29-0.87), engaged in prohibited street-based income generation (AHR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.24-0.69), and engaged in illegal income generating activities (AHR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06-0.61) were significantly less likely to report cessation of injection drug use., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that socioeconomic factors, in particular engagement in prohibited street-based and illegal income generating activities, may pose barriers to ceasing injection drug use among this population. Effort to improve access to stable and secure income, as well as employment opportunities may assist youth in transitioning away from injection drug use., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Our study is not a randomized controlled trial; thus the trial registration is not applicable.

N2  - Background The number of welfare recipients has steadily increased in Japan during recent years, although the number of homeless persons has decreased. Despite there being many reports regarding medicolegal death among homeless persons, medicolegal death among welfare recipients has not been fully investigated. Methods We identified 10,293 individuals who received welfare aid during their lifetime among the 81,867 cases that were examined by the Tokyo Medical Examiner's Office (2008-2013). We retrospectively compared the proportions of medicolegal death to total population, age, sex, family status, clinical history, and manners/causes of death among non-indigent persons (controls), homeless persons, and welfare recipients. Results A higher proportion of medicolegal death to total population was observed among the welfare recipients, compared with the controls. The welfare recipients (65.5 years) were younger than the controls (68.9 years), and the proportions of male sex and living alone were higher among the welfare recipients. Hypertension and circulatory disease were the leading clinical conditions among the welfare recipients. Death due to disease was the leading manner of death, and circulatory disease was the leading cause of death among the welfare recipients. The proportion of individuals with a long period between death and discovery (which made determining the cause of death difficult) was also higher among the welfare recipients. Conclusion Welfare recipients have a greater risk of sudden death compared with non-indigent persons. Preventive strategies should target middle-aged to elderly men who live alone, and should address their risks of circulatory diseases and solitary death.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Stunting affects close to 2.4 million children in Uganda, and it is among the major contributors to the annual loss in productivity of the equivalent of US$899 million., OBJECTIVE: This study sought to identify the key underlying causes of the persistently high stunting rates in a region of Uganda known to have low poverty rates and a high agricultural output., METHODS: A matched case-control study was conducted in Buhweju district, southwest Uganda to compare prior exposures between stunted children (cases) and nonstunted children (controls)., RESULTS: The sample comprised 56 cases and 112 controls, totaling 168 children aged 6 to 59 months. There were almost equal numbers of boys and girls in the sample. Boys were significantly more likely to be stunted compared to girls (odds ratio [OR]: 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-4.2; P < .05). Stunted children were significantly less likely to be introduced to complementary foods at an appropriate age and their primary caregivers lacked knowledge about stunting. The odds of stunting were 2.4 times greater for children in food-insecure households compared to those in food-secure households (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1-5.0; P < .05) and 4.5 times greater among children who resided in poor quality houses (OR: 4.5, 95% CI: 1.4-13.0; P < .05)., CONCLUSION: Low access to appropriate complementary diets, sex of child, food insecurity, poor socioeconomic status, and low knowledge about stunting were the main predictors of childhood stunting in the study population.

T1  - Dream homes and dead ends in the city: a photo essay experiment
A1  - Fast D. 
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Research focused on the relationship between place and health demonstrates that it is complex and shifting, as overlapping social, historical, institutional and political and economic processes continually transform the landscapes in which lived experiences are embedded. Understanding this relationship requires knowledge of the situated meanings and local worlds that ethnographic methods are well suited to investigate. However, even conventional ethnographic methods can be inadequate to capture the embodied, lived experience of place - experiences in which the sensory and inner processes of memory and imagination are often privileged. Accessing these experiences and processes can require more experimental methodological approaches. In this article, I present work from a series of photo essays created between 2011 and 2016 by 15 young people who inhabit the social, spatial and economic margins of Vancouver, Canada, and discuss some of the challenges and opportunities presented by this methodology. Created over 5 years, and broadly focused on how they understood, experienced and navigated their 'place' in the city in the midst of poverty, addiction, violence and physical and mental health crises, the photo essays young people produced are embedded with personal biographies and trajectories, as well as shared experiences of geography, precarity and possibility in Vancouver.Copyright © 2017 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The literature is clear that adults who are currently homeless also have higher rates of intentional injuries, such as assault and suicide attempts. No study has assessed whether intentional injuries are exacerbated because of substance use among adults with a history of homelessness., METHODS: Data were obtained from a cohort of adults admitted to 3 urban emergency departments (EDs) in Texas from 2007 to 2010 (N = 596). Logistic regression analyses were used to determine whether a history of homelessness was associated with alcohol use at time of injury in intentional violent injuries (gunshot, stabbing, or injury consistent with assault)., RESULTS: 39% adults with a history of homelessness who were treated at trauma centers for a violent injury. Bivariate analyses indicated that adults who had ever experienced homelessness have 1.67 increased odds, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.11, 2.50], of any intentional violent injury and 1.95 increased odds (95% CI [1.12, 3.40]) of a stabbing injury than adults with no history of homelessness., CONCLUSIONS: Adults who experienced homelessness in their lifetime were more likely to visit EDs for violencerelated injuries. Given our limited knowledge of the injuries that prompt ED use by currently homeless populations, future studies are needed to understand the etiology of injuries, and substance-related injuries specifically, among adults with a history of homelessness.

N2  - PROBLEM: Street-involved youth experience many barriers to accessing health and social services. There is a literature gap in the literature regarding evidence-based interventions to facilitate engagement with street-involved youth., METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study of preliminary findings from a large mixed-methods study was undertaken to assess the impact of a resilience-based motivational intervention. This intervention was grounded in frameworks including strengths-based and resilience-based communication using the Seven C's Model of Resilience, positive youth development, and motivational interviewing that are particularly relevant to youth. Individual interviews were conducted with two subsets of youth who participated (n = 3) or did not participate (n = 3) in the intervention. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify themes between the intervention and comparison groups., FINDINGS: Preliminary themes identified across the sample include (1) establishing a trusting relationship, (2) strengthening self-worth and resilience, (3) focusing on goals, and (4) perceiving a sense of hope and possibility., CONCLUSIONS: The themes identified the importance of positive relationships with care providers built upon a foundation of trust to engage youth to remain motivated and focused on their goals.Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - This study addresses whether providing housing vouchers through the Family Unification Program (FUP) to families involved in the child welfare system reduces child maltreatment and the need for child welfare services. The study uses child welfare administrative data on 326 children in Portland, Oregon, and 502 children in San Diego, California from the point at which their families were referred to the program through 18 months post-referral. Using a quasi-experimental waitlist comparison design, probit regressions show little impact of FUP on preventing child removal from home, but some positive impact on reunification among children already placed out of home. Hazard estimations show receipt of FUP speeds up child welfare case closure. Impacts on new reports of abuse and neglect are mixed, but point toward reduced reports. Low rates of removal among intact comparison families and high rates of reunification for children in out-of-home care suggest poor targeting of housing resources. Housing vouchers are being given to families not bearing the risks the program is intended to address. The presence of some positive findings suggests that housing vouchers might help reduce child welfare involvement if better targeting were practiced by child welfare agencies.Copyright © Society for Community Research and Action 2017.

The present study uses rich longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, augmented with Census, American Community Survey and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development administrative data, to unpack these nil effects. Analyses include 194 children ( X age = 6.2 years) living in assisted housing in 1995 or later who were 13-17 years old in 2002 or 2007, and an unassisted comparison group of 215 children who were income-eligible for, but never received, housing assistance. Results suggested no mean effects of living in assisted housing during childhood on adolescent cognitive, behavior, and health outcomes, addressing selection through propensity score matching and instrumental variables. However, quantile regressions suggest assisted housing provides an added boost for children with the best cognitive performance and fewest behavior problems but has opposite effects on children with the lowest cognitive scores and most behavior problems. Further tests indicate that these differences are not explained either by neighborhood effects or housing quality. A potentially fruitful avenue for future research investigates differences in how parents take advantage of the housing affordability provided by assisted housing to benefit their children.Copyright © Society for Community Research and Action 2016.

T1  - Can Housing and Service Interventions Reduce Family Separations for Families Who Experience Homelessness?
A1  - Shinn M.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Family break-up is common in families experiencing homelessness. This paper examines the extent of separations of children from parents and of partners from each other and whether housing and service interventions reduced separations and their precursors among 1,857 families across 12 sites who participated in the Family Options Study. Families in shelters were randomized to offers of one of three interventions: permanent housing subsidies that reduce expenditures for rent to 30% of families' income, temporary rapid re-housing subsidies with some services directed at housing and employment, and transitional housing in supervised facilities with extensive psychosocial services. Each group was compared to usual care families who were eligible for that intervention but received no special offer. Twenty months later, permanent housing subsidies almost halved rates of child separation and more than halved rates of foster care placements; the other interventions did not affect separations significantly. Predictors of separation were primarily homelessness and drug abuse (all comparisons), and alcohol dependence (one comparison). Although housing subsidies reduced homelessness, alcohol dependence, intimate partner violence, and economic stressors, the last three variables had no association with child separations in the subsidy comparison; thus subsidies had indirect effects via reductions in homelessness. No intervention reduced partner separations.Copyright © Society for Community Research and Action 2016.

T1  - Permanent Housing for Child Welfare-Involved Families: Impact on Child Maltreatment Overview
A1  - Fowler P.J.
A1  - Schoeny M. 
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - A longitudinal randomized controlled trial tested whether access to permanent housing reduces child maltreatment among inadequately housed families under investigation for child abuse and neglect. The study followed homeless and child welfare-involved families randomly assigned to receive a referral for housing subsidies plus housing case management (n = 75, 196 children) or housing case management alone (n = 75, 186 children). Latent growth models examined change in caregiver-reported frequencies of psychological aggression, physical abuse, and neglect toward children at five time points across 2.5 years. Intent-to-treat analyses suggested treatment differences for minor assault and neglect that approached significance; families randomly assigned to permanent housing plus case management exhibited marginally greater declines compared to families referred for housing case management only. Caregiver psychological aggression remained high over time, regardless of treatment condition. No evidence indicated higher risk families benefitted more from permanent housing. Results show some promise of permanent housing and highlight the complex needs of homeless families under investigation for child maltreatment. Findings emphasize the importance of continued involvement from the child welfare system to connect families with important resources.Copyright © Society for Community Research and Action 2017.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Individuals experiencing homelessness are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity. The At Home/Chez Soi study provides a unique opportunity to first examine baseline levels of food security among homeless individuals with mental illness and second to evaluate the effect of a Housing First (HF) intervention on food security in this population., DESIGN: At Home/Chez Soi was a 2-year randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of HF compared with usual care among homeless adults with mental illness, stratified by level of need for mental health services (high or moderate). Logistic regressions tested baseline associations between food security (US Food Security Survey Module), study site, sociodemographic variables, duration of homelessness, alcohol/substance use, physical health and service utilization. Negative binomial regression determined the impact of the HF intervention on achieving levels of high or marginal food security over an 18-month follow-up period (6 to 24 months)., SETTING: Community settings at five Canadian sites (Moncton, Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver)., SUBJECTS: Homeless adults with mental illness (n 2148)., RESULTS: Approximately 41 % of our sample reported high or marginal food security at baseline, but this figure varied with gender, age, mental health issues and substance use problems. High need participants who received HF were more likely to achieve marginal or high food security than those receiving usual care, but only at the Toronto and Moncton sites., CONCLUSIONS: Our large multi-site study demonstrated low levels of food security among homeless experiencing mental illness. HF showed promise for improving food security among participants with high levels of need for mental health services, with notable site differences.

N2  - Despite its increasing popularity, little is known about the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model in primary care settings serving homeless populations. Our objective was to understand how patient experience differs between a PCMH demonstration practice designed for homeless people in Massachusetts and other practices participating in the same statewide initiative. The study population included 194 homeless patients and 1,868 patients from comparison practices. Patient experience was compared on key measures of patient-centeredness, while applying case-mix adjustment to control for sociodemographic and clinical factors. The practice for homeless patients scored higher than the comparison group on self-management support and behavioral health integration, while being equivalent on three other measures. Potential areas for improvement include measures related to communication, front desk staff, and timely appointments. We discuss possible explanations for the observed pattern of results in the context of the unique challenges faced by a practice designed to serve individuals experiencing homelessness.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Homelessness is associated with increased prevalence of mental health disorders, substance use disorders and mental health/substance use disorder comorbidity in the United States of America. Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) living in the United States are at increased risk for homelessness, and have also evidenced elevated mental health and substance use disorder prevalence relative to their non-MSM male counterparts., DESIGN AND METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from a randomised controlled trial estimating the diagnostic prevalence of substance use/mental health disorder comorbidity among a sample of homeless, substance-dependent MSM (DSM-IV verified; n=131)., RESULTS: The most prevalent substance use/mental health disorder comorbidities were stimulant dependence comorbid with at least one depressive disorder (28%), alcohol dependence comorbid with at least one depressive disorder (26%) and stimulant dependence comorbid with antisocial personality disorder (25%)., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION(S): Diagnostic depression and antisocial personality disorder both demonstrated high rates of prevalence among homeless, substance-dependent (particularly stimulant and alcohol dependent) MSM.

N2  - Permanent supportive housing (PSH) is an evidence-based health intervention for persons experiencing homelessness, but the impact of individual mechanisms within this intervention on health requires further research. This study examines the longitudinal impact of the mechanism of supportive housing within a peer-delivered PSH model on overall health and mental health (as measured by psychological distress and self-report of bothersome symptoms) outcomes in an ethnically diverse population. The 237 participants in the study included persons who were homeless or at risk of homelessness and who also had been diagnosed with a serious mental illness. Sixty-one percent of all participants received supportive housing. All 3 outcomes were significantly associated with quality of life indicators, recovery, and social connectedness. In addition, overall health was significantly associated with employment, age, and psychological distress. Psychological distress was associated with gender, type of housing, and history of violence or trauma. Experiencing bothersome symptoms was associated with drug use, history of violence or trauma, and psychological distress. Longitudinal models of these 3 outcomes showed that supportive housing was significantly associated with good to excellent health 6 months after baseline (odds ratio = 3.11, 95% confidence interval [1.12, 8.66]). The models also demonstrated that the supportive housing and comparison groups experienced decreased psychological distress after baseline. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of supportive housing within the context of PSH, particularly for the overall health of participants, and the positive overall impact of PSH on mental health in a diverse population.

N2  - Substance use is highly prevalent among youth living with HIV (YLWH) and negatively impacts HIV care. This study sought to determine whether the CRAFFT (Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, and Trouble), designed to screen for problematic substance use, is reliably associated with substance use behaviors among YLWH. A cross-sectional sample of 2216 youth (ages 12-26) were recruited through the adolescent medicine trials network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. Participants completed a self-administered survey. Over half screened positive on the CRAFFT (i.e., >=2). Among frequent substance users, those older in age, behaviorally infected, with history of incarceration or unstably housed were more likely to screen positive on the CRAFFT. Study findings suggest that the CRAFFT reliably identifies youth who use substances. Thus, screening measures such as the CRAFFT should be utilized routinely in HIV clinical settings for youth.

N2  - Individual placement and support (IPS) has not been tested experimentally among people recently housed with a scattered-site Housing First program. Ninety recently housed people were randomized to IPS or usual services. Regression models estimated via GEE were used to compare employment outcomes. Over 8 months of follow-up with good fidelity, fifteen (34 %) people in the IPS group versus nine (22 %) in the control group found competitive employment (p = 0.16). Adjusted odds of obtaining competitive employment were greater in the IPS group (OR 2.42, 95 %CI 1.13-5.16). Other employment outcomes were not significantly different between groups. Satisfaction with services was greater in the group receiving IPS. In this study, IPS was a modestly useful adjunct to scattered-site Housing First for people with mental illness who have been homeless.

T1  - Relationship between food insecurity, child weight status, and parent-reported child eating and snacking behaviors
A1  - Kral T.V.E.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - PURPOSE: Prior studies showed that food insecurity may increase the odds of obesity in children and adults. We still know very little about the familial aggregation of obesity in food-insecure households or the mechanisms by which food insecurity confers an increased risk of obesity to children. The purpose of this study was to compare children and mothers from food-insecure and food-secure households in their weight status, child eating patterns/behaviors, and maternal feeding practices., DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty mothers of 8-10-year-old children were asked to complete questionnaires, including the U.S. Household Food Security survey, and had their own and their children's heights and weights measured., RESULTS: The odds of a child being obese were five times higher for children from food-insecure households compared with children from food-secure households (95% confidence interval 1.15-20.8). In univariate analyses, children from food-insecure households showed significantly greater external eating, both past satiation and in the absence of hunger (p < .03), and mothers from food-insecure households expressed significantly greater concern about their children's weight and used restrictive feeding practices to a greater extent (p < .03) when compared with families from food-secure households. A greater proportion of children from food-secure households consumed three to four snacks per day (45.9 vs. 15.4%), while a higher proportion of children from food-insecure households consumed five or more snacks per day (15.4 vs. 0%; p = .02)., PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: These findings provide further support for an association between food insecurity and childhood obesity and suggest that differences in external eating, child snacking patterns, and select maternal feeding practices may be implicated in food-insecure children's overconsumption of calories. When caring for food-insecure children, healthcare providers should screen for problematic eating patterns and feeding practices.Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - A randomized controlled trial was conducted with homeless gay and bisexual men to assess the impact of two culturally sensitive intervention programs on reduction of drug use and risky sexual behavior. In this study, gay and bisexual men between 18 and 46 years of age were randomly assigned to one of two culturally sensitive behavioral intervention programs: a Nurse Case Management Plus Contingency Management (NCM + CM; n = 204) or a Standard Education Plus Contingency Management (SE + CM; n = 210) program. Regardless of group assignment, significant and clinically relevant reductions were observed in stimulant use over time. Multivariable predictors of stimulant use at 4- and 8-month follow-up evaluations were recent injection drug use, tested positive for HIV, or for use of amphetamine. Data revealed a significant linear decline over time for those who had sex with multiple partners. Furthermore, being HIV positive was associated with reporting multiple partners, while higher homophobia scores and having children were inversely related to reports of having sex with multiple partners at follow-up. Culturally sensitive approaches are needed to successfully reduce drug use and risky sexual activities among gay and bisexual populations.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The current study sought to test hard drug use outcomes for youth receiving a strengths-based outreach and advocacy intervention that linked youth to either a shelter or a drop-in center., METHODS: Homeless youth (14-24 years old) were engaged by research assistants (RAs) at soup kitchens, parks, libraries, and other locations that homeless youth were known to frequent. Youth were randomly assigned to receive six months of advocacy that focused on linking youth to a drop-in center (n = 40) or to a crisis shelter (n = 39). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Hard drug use over time was the main outcome. Intervention condition and service connection were used as predictors for the baseline level and the slope of change in hard drug use over time. Data analysis was conducted with Bernoulli Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling in HLM7., RESULTS: The current study found that those who were in the drop-in linkage condition exhibited a greater reduction in their odds of using hard drugs during the follow-up points than their counterparts in the shelter linkage condition. And finally, those who utilized services more often during the follow-ups were those who exhibited less hard drug use at baseline and less reduction in their odds of using hard drugs., CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that drop-in centers, which are often characterized by low-demand programming and few behavioral restrictions, are effective for addressing hard drug use among homeless youth.

N2  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening has taken on new importance as a result of updated guidelines and new curative therapies. Rew studies have assessed HCV in homeless populations including women. The SHADOW cohort in San Francisco recruited and studied homeless and unstably housed women; sampling was systematically conducted at free meal programs, homeless shelters, and low-cost single room occupancy hotels, and HIV-infected women were oversampled. Study inclusion criteria included female sex, age >=18 years, and a lifetime history of housing instability (slept in a public place, a shelter, or stayed with a series other people because they had no other place to sleep). In this paper, we estimated: (1) prevalence and correlates of HCV exposure; (2) the proportion who were unaware of their status; and (3) assessed correlates of both outcomes. Among 246 women, 45.9% were anti-HCV positive, of whom 61.1% were HIV coinfected. Consistent with the recruitment strategy, just over half of the sample (n=127; 51.6%) was HIV-infected. A majority (72%) of the women were in the 'baby-boomer' cohort (born between 1945 and 1965); 19% reported recent (past 6-months) injection drug use (IDU). Factors independently associated with anti-HCV positivity were: being born in 1965 or earlier (Adjusted Odds Ratio ((AOR) 3.94; 95%CI: 1.88, 8.26), a history of IDU (AOR 4.0; 95%CI: 1.68, 9.55), and number of psychiatric diagnoses (AOR 1.16; 95%CI: 1.08, 1.25). Women with symptoms of current depression had lower adjusted odds of HCV seropositivity (AOR 0.24; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.48). Overall, 26.8% reported never being HCV tested, and among anti-HCV positives, 27.4% were unaware of their status. Factors independently associated with women not knowing their HCV status (controlling for birth cohort status and IDU) included: lower income (per $100 increase), AOR; 0.78 (95%CI: 0.65, 0.94); fewer psychiatric diagnosis (per diagnosis), AOR: 0.80 (95%CI: 0.70, 0.95); and any recent cocaine use (yes vs. no), AOR; 5.63 (95%CI: 1.16, 27.36). Results fill an important gap in information regarding HCV among homeless women, and confirm the need for enhanced screening in this population where a high proportion are baby-boomers and have a history of drug use and psychiatric problems. Due to their age and risk profile, there is a high probability that women in this study have been infected for decades, and thus have significant liver disease. The association with mental illness and HCV suggests that in addition increased screening, augmenting mental health care and support may be needed to enhance treatment success.

T1  - Racial differences in cigarette smoking among homeless youth

N2  - Introduction: Several studies have reported pronounced racial/ethnic differences in smoking behavior among homeless youth. Better understanding the factors underlying racial/ethnic differences in daily smoking among homeless youth may help inform programs to reduce smoking in this population. Method(s): Data come from a probability sample of homeless youth in Los Angeles County collected between 2008 and 2009. The sample includes 116 African American, 99 Hispanic, and 119 White youth with ages ranging from 13 to 24 years. Chi-square tests were used to test the differences in daily smoking among African American, Hispanic, and White youth. Propensity score and doubly robust methods were used to produce a less biased estimate of the association between daily smoking and race/ethnicity after having removed the effect of potential confounders. Result(s): The daily smoking rate for White youth was 70.1%, more than 31 percentage points than the rates for either African American or Hispanic youth. Propensity score analysis revealed that the majority of the racial/ethnic differences in smoking rates could be explained by differences in homelessness severity, although background characteristics and comorbidity were relevant as well. Conclusion(s): As programs are developed to reduce smoking among homeless youth, results suggest that additional outreach may be needed to engage White youth in services. Also, smoking prevention programs may benefit from incorporating a social network-based approach that assists youth in fostering relationships with lower-risk peers, as well as addressing other forms of substance use. Incorporating these elements may help reduce the large racial/ethnic disparities in daily smoking among homeless youth. Implications: This report extends the small existing literature on racial/ethnic differences in smoking among homeless youth in two important respects. First, it confirms differences in daily smoking, an important indicator of dependence, across racial/ethnic groups. Second, it seeks to understand the extent to which differences in smoking can be explained by demographic characteristics (other than race/ethnicity), background factors, homelessness severity, and comorbidity characteristics known to be associated with substance use among homeless youth.Copyright © The Author 2016.

N2  - Background: Out-of-home care (OoHC) refers to young people removed from their families by the state because of abuse, neglect or other adversities. Many of the young people experience poor mental health and social function before, during and after leaving care. Rigorously evaluated interventions are urgently required. This publication describes the protocol for the Ripple project and notes early findings from a controlled trial demonstrating the feasibility of the work. The Ripple project is implementing and evaluating a complex mental health intervention that aims to strengthen the therapeutic capacities of carers and case managers of young people (12-17 years) in OoHC. Method(s): The study is conducted in partnership with mental health, substance abuse and social services in Melbourne, with young people as participants. It has three parts: 1. Needs assessment and implementation of a complex mental health intervention; 2. A 3-year controlled trial of the mental health, social and economic outcomes; and 3. Nested process evaluation of the intervention. Result(s): Early findings characterising the young people, their carers and case managers and implementing the intervention are available. The trial Wave 1 includes interviews with 176 young people, 52% of those eligible in the study population, 104 carers and 79 case managers. Conclusion(s): Implementing and researching an affordable service system intervention appears feasible and likely to be applicable in other places and countries. Success of the intervention will potentially contribute to reducing mental ill-health among these young people, including suicide attempts, self-harm and substance abuse, as well as reducing homelessness, social isolation and contact with the criminal justice system.

T1  - Mental health and psychosocial interventions for children and adolescents in street situations in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review
A1  - Watters C.
A1  - O'Callaghan P. 
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - This article reviews the available quantitative literature on mental health and psychosocial interventions among children and adolescents in street situations (CASS) in low- and middle-income countries (LAMIC). PRISMA standards for systematic reviews were used to search five databases as well as grey literature. There were four inclusion criteria; studies had to involve a description of an external (i.e. outside of the home) mental health or psychosocial intervention/treatment, must be focused in LAMIC, must be focused on CASS, and must empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention described. A quality assessment tool was used to assess the risk of bias in included articles. Five studies were included. A multidisciplinary care approach was significant in reducing psychological distress, substance use and improving sleeping arrangements (p < 0.001, n = 400). Residency step programmes were on average 52% successful in reintegrating children back into communities (n = 863). Resilience training significantly increased psychological well-being components (p < 0.001, n = 60). Emotional regulation training had a beneficial improvement in emotional regulation. FORNET (Forensic Offender Rehabilitation Narrative Exposure Therapy) (n = 32) reduced the number of self-reported offenses committed [t(19.26) = 1.81, p = 0.043]. There are not enough credible studies available to develop a firm conclusion on the effectiveness of mental health and psychosocial interventions delivered to CASS in LAMIC. The limited amount of studies, inconsistent outcome measures, interventions and imperfect study designs maintain that this is an area in need of greater attention and research focus.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Objectives (1) To determine whether street children who visit drop-in centers experience better physical and mental health, and engage in less substance use than street children who do not visit centers. (2) To determine whether the duration of attendance at a center has an impact on the above outcomes. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study with 69 street children from two drop-in centers in New Delhi, India (attenders) and a comparison group of 65 street children who did not visit drop-in centers (non-attenders). We used pretested questionnaires to assess their physical health, substance use status and mental health. Results Attenders experienced fewer ill health outcomes, engaged in less substance use, and had better mental health outcomes than non-attenders (p < 0.01). For every month of attendance at a drop-in center, street children experienced 2.1% (95% CI 0% to 4.1%, p = 0.05) fewer ill health outcomes per month and used 4.6% (95% CI 1.3% to 8%, p = 0.01) fewer substances. Street children were also less likely to have been a current substance user than a never substance user for every additional month of attendance at a center (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.66-0.96, p = 0.02). Duration of drop-in center attendance was not a significant factor in predicting mental health problems. Conclusion Drop-in centers may improve the physical health of street children and reduce their substance abuse. Rigorous longitudinal studies are needed to better determine if drop-in centers impact the health and substance use status of street children in LMICs.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Objective: Although youth homelessness presents a significant public health problem, the needs of homeless youths with mental illness, as distinct from adults, are not well understood. This study examined the unique demographic, clinical, and service use characteristics of homeless youths. Method(s): At Home/Chez Soi was a large randomized controlled trial of the Housing First model in five cities in Canada. Of 2,255 participants, 7% (N=164) were youths ages 18 to 24. Youths were compared with older participants on baseline demographic, clinical, and service use characteristics. Result(s): More youths than adults had not finished high school (76% versus 54%), had a drug use disorder (66% versus 52%), and had been assaulted in the past six months (44% versus 36%) (all p<.05). Fewer than half the youths (49%) had a regular medical doctor, 50% reported unmet need for health care, and 61% visited an emergency department in the past six months. Conclusion(s): This sample of homeless youths with mental illness had low education, high rates of substance use disorders and victimization, and problems accessing services. These findings suggest that youths have trajectories to homelessness and service needs that are distinct from adults and may guide future planning for this vulnerable population.

N2  - Background: Inappropriate child feeding and caring practices are a major cause of malnutrition. To date, no studies have examined concordance and discordance of child feeding and preventive behavior and their predictors in developing countries. Method(s): We used baseline data generated from A 2-year-longitudinal agriculture-nutrition panel survey conducted from February 9 to April 9, 2014, in nine districts encompassing 20 randomly selected counties in Oromiya Region and Southern Nation, Nationality and Peoples Region in Ethiopia. Households were recruited using the Expanded Program on Immunization sampling method. A total of 623 children under the age of 5 years and their respective caregivers were included in the analyses. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for clustered observations. Result(s): Concordance of poor child feeding and preventive behavior was observed in 45.1% of the children, while 45.5% of the children were suffering from discordance of poor child feeding and preventive behavior. Concordance and discordance of poor child feeding and preventive behavior had almost different predictors. Concordance of poor child feeding and preventive behavior was significantly associated with the age of the caretaker of >=40 years (odds ratio (OR) = 2.14; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 4.41), low household dietary diversity (OR = 3.69; 95% CI: 1.93, 7.04), medium household dietary diversity (OR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.17, 4.00), severe household food insecurity (OR = 1.72; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.93), and increase with increasing child age. Conclusion(s): A substantial number of children in the southwest of rural Ethiopia are exposed to both poor child feeding and preventive behavior. Low household dietary diversity and extreme food insecurity household were predictors of concordance of poor child feeding and poor preventive behavior and provide useful entry points for comprehensive interventions to address child feeding and caring in the area.Copyright © 2016 Netsanet Fentahun et al.

N2  - Purpose The rising numbers of alcohol intoxicated adolescents (AIA) treated in emergency care units in several European countries have drawn attention to this target group for prevention. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess a broad array of developmental hazards and their stability in AIA and to compare their distribution with representative samples (RS). Methods A multisite cohort study of AIA aged 13-17 years assessed, in the hospital (t0) and 6 months later (t1), (family) violence, cannabis and alcohol use, school problems, delinquency, homelessness, depression, and suicidality, using items from representative German surveys: Children and Adolescent Health Survey (KiGGS), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and Communities That Care Youth Survey. We calculated the differences between AIA and RS and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. For AIA respondents who completed t0 and t1 information, we calculated prevalence/persistence/incidence of developmental hazards and corresponding 95% confidence interval. Results A total of 342 AIA participated at t0, 228 at t1 (67%). AIA had a significantly higher burden of concomitant risks regarding physical and emotional family abuse, (sexual) victimization, cannabis use, binge drinking, school expulsion, police arrest, gang membership, and being violent. Six months after hospitalization, emotional family abuse (34.1%), cannabis use (23.5%), depression (14.8%), and being violent (13.2%) were especially prevalent. Conclusions Developmental hazards are up to six times more prevalent in AIA than in RS. Therefore, when assessing the risk profile of AIA, it is important to consider developmental hazards as well as detrimental alcohol use.Copyright © 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine

N2  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to better understand the prevalence and correlates of substance use behaviors among HIV-infected adolescents in HIV care settings. Methods A cross-sectional sample of 2216 youth living with HIV (YLWH; ages 12-26) were recruited through the Adolescent Trials Network for HIV Interventions. Participants completed a one-time survey on sociodemographic factors, substance use and health behaviors. We used logistic regression models to understand the correlates of substance use outcomes. Results Overall, weekly or more frequent tobacco use was reported by 32.9% of participants, 27.5% marijuana use, and 21.3% alcohol use; and 22.5% reported any other illicit drug use. In multivariable models, young MSM had higher odds of reporting each substance use behavior, and transgender women had increased odds of marijuana and other illicit drug use. Criminal justice involvement, unstable housing, condomless sex, and suboptimal antiretroviral therapy was associated with increased risk of substance use behaviors. Conclusions Study findings highlight the need for regular screening for substance use in HIV care settings in order to improve access to and delivery of culturally competent substance use prevention and treatment services.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

N2  - The homelessness and child protective services (CPS) systems are closely linked. This study examines the patterns and sequence of families' involvement with homeless shelters and CPS, as well as whether involvement in each system predicts involvement in the other using linked administrative records for 258 families recruited in emergency shelters in Alameda County, California. More than half of families were reported to CPS at some point, but less than one-fifth ever had a report substantiated. Reports that were uninvestigated or unfounded increased in the months leading up to shelter entry and spiked immediately afterward, but substantiations and child removals increased only later. Shelter use before study entry was associated with CPS referrals and investigations after study entry, although not with substantiated cases or child removals. However, CPS involvement before study entry was not associated with returns to shelter after study entry. These results imply that an unsubstantiated report of neglect or abuse may serve as an early warning signal for homelessness and that preventive strategies aiming to affect both homeless and child protective systems should focus on reducing homelessness. CPS workers should evaluate families' housing needs and attempt to link families to appropriate resources. Black families were disproportionately referred to CPS after shelter entry after controlling for other family characteristics, but race was not associated with substantiations of neglect or abuse or with child removals. Findings lend modest support to human decision-making and institutional explanations of racial disproportionalities in CPS involvement, especially for reporters outside of the CPS system.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background and Objectives: "Housing First" has been shown to improve housing stability in homeless individuals with mental illness, but had not been empirically tested in homeless youth. We aimed to evaluate the effect of "Housing First" on housing stability in homeless youth aged 18 to 24 years participating in At Home/Chez Soi, a 24-month randomized trial of "Housing First" in 5 Canadian cities. METHOD(S): Homeless individuals with mental illness were randomized to receive "Housing First" (combined with assertive community treatment or intensive case management depending on their level of need) or treatment as usual. We defined our primary outcome, housing stability, as the percent of days stably housed as a proportion of days for which residence data were available. RESULT(S): Of 2148 participants who completed baseline interviews and were randomized, 7% (n = 156) were youth aged 18 to 24 years; 87 received "Housing First" and 69 received treatment as usual. In an adjusted analysis, youth in "Housing First" were stably housed a mean of 437 of 645 (65%) days for which data were available compared with youth in treatment as usual, who were stably housed a mean of 189 of 582 (31%) days for which data were available, resulting in an adjusted mean difference of 34% (95% confidence interval, 24%-45%; P <.001). CONCLUSION(S): "Housing First" was associated with improved housing stability in homeless youth with mental illness. Future research should explore whether adaptations of the model for youth yield additional improvements in housing stability and other outcomes.Copyright © 2016 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - Objective/Background: The diagnostics of latent tuberculosis infection in Poland using the tuberculin skin test is challenging due to the obligatory Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccinations. Interferon-gamma release assays are still very rarely used for diagnostics. We compared the tuberculin skin test and the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test to evaluate the degree of latent tuberculosis infection in at-risk groups for tuberculosis (homeless, close contacts, periodic contacts, nursing-home attendees) and in healthy individuals. Method(s): QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube tests were carried out on 785 individuals from the homeless (n = 150), close contacts (n = 171), periodic contacts (n = 163), nursing-home attendees (n = 152), and healthy individuals (n = 149). The tuberculin skin test was performed on 129, 156, 147, 148, and 121 participants, respectively. We evaluated the (a) correlation between serum concentrations of interferon gamma and the tuberculin-skin-test induration diameter; (b) between the number of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube-positive results and the tuberculin-skin-test diameter in the studied groups; and (c) agreement between both tests and the kappa coefficient using the tuberculin-skin-test diameters of 5, 10, and 15 mm. Result(s): Larger tuberculin-skin-test induration diameters were associated with elevated serum concentrations of interferon gamma. We found a positive correlation between the number of positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube screening results and the tuberculin-skin-test induration diameter. The agreement between QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube and tuberculin-skin-test screening results improved with increasing tuberculin-skin-test induration diameter. Conclusion(s): Based on measures of tuberculin-skin-test induration diameter alone, it is difficult to diagnose latent tuberculosis infection with certainty. The agreement of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test increases with the tuberculin-skin-test diameter. Tuberculin-skin-test diameters larger than 15 mm are more likely to be associated with active infection.Copyright © 2015 Asian African Society for Mycobacteriology.

N2  - Objective To assess the rate of visual impairment and quantify the unmet eye care needs within Toronto's homeless youth community. Design Prospective and cross sectional. Participants Ninety randomly selected homeless youth aged 16-24 years. Methods From each of 9 participating homeless youth shelters and drop-in centres in Toronto, 10 English-speaking youths between ages 16 and 24 were randomly recruited. Information regarding sociodemographics, medical history, subjective visual acuity, and access to eye care was collected. Comprehensive visual screening and undilated direct fundoscopy were also performed. Results The median age of participants was 21 years (interquartile range = 19-23 years), and 62.2% were male. Most participants were homeless for less than 5 years (90%) and earning less than $500 monthly (57.8%). Despite 51.1% of participants having previously owned corrective lenses, only 20% of participants currently owned them when assessed/at study time. When analyzing the better-seeing eye, presenting visual acuity was 20/50 or worse in 18.9% (95% CI 10.8%-27.0%) of participants. Pinhole occlusion decreased the number to 2.2% (95% CI 0%-5.3%). The most common cause of visual impairment was uncorrected refractive error. Ocular pathology was observed in 8 participants. Compared to adults, youth have similar functional visual impairment (adults 24.0%, youth 18.9%) but less impairment uncorrectable by pinhole occlusion (adults 11.0%, youth 2.2%) and are less dissatisfied with their vision (adults 70.0%, youths 36.7%). Although a higher proportion of homeless youths have visited an eye specialist in the past year (adults 14.0%; youths 17.8%), neither group is visiting as frequently as the Canadian average (41%) (p < 0.01). Conclusions Homeless youth have a high prevalence of visual impairment, even when living within a system of universal health insurance. Ongoing vision-screening programs, readily accessible free eye clinics, and particularly low-cost glasses may help address this need.Copyright © 2016 Canadian Ophthalmological Society.

N2  - Background: Universal access to the School Breakfast Program (SBP) is intended to help low-income and food-insecure students overcome barriers to eating breakfast. However, SBP participation is often still low despite universal access. Further information is needed with regard to these children's breakfast behaviors, and in particular breakfast behaviors among youth from food-insecure families, to inform effective breakfast interventions. Objective(s): The objective of this study was to examine breakfast behaviors among a large sample of urban students with universal access to the SBP and to identify differences in breakfast behaviors among children from food-secure compared with food-insecure households. Method(s): A cross-sectional study of 821 fourth- through sixth-grade students and their parents from 16 schools was conducted. Students reported the foods/drinks selected and location of obtaining food/drink on the morning of data collection, parents reported household food security status using the 6-itemFood Security Survey Module, and the school district provided SBP participation data during the fall semester of 2013. Multivariable linear regression models accounting for school-level clustering were used to examine differences in breakfast behaviors across 3 levels of household food security: food secure, lowfood secure, and very lowfood secure. Result(s): Students participated in the SBP 31.2%of possible days, with 13%never participating in the SBP. One-fifth (19.4%) of students purchased something from a corner store for breakfast, and 16.9% skipped breakfast. Forty-six percent of students were food insecure; few differences in breakfast behaviors were observed across levels of food security. Conclusion(s): Despite universal access to the SBP, participation in the SBP is low. Breakfast skipping and selection of foods of lownutritional quality in the morning are common, regardless of household food security status. Additional novel implementation of the SBP and addressing students' breakfast preferences may be necessary to further reduce barriers to students obtaining a free, healthful breakfast. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01924130.

T1  - An fMRI investigation of the effects of culture on evaluations of stigmatized individuals
A1  - Krendl A.C. 
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Certain groups (e.g., women, older adults, and the economically disadvantaged) are universally stigmatized. Numerous studies, however, have identified cross-cultural differences in the attitudes expressed toward stigmatized groups. These differences may potentially be due to existing cross-cultural dissimilarities in social status for some groups. The current study used fMRI to examine whether Chinese and Caucasian-American participants engage the same cognitive and affective mechanisms when perceiving stigmatized individuals with similarly low social status in both cultures (homeless individuals), but different cognitive and/or affective processes when evaluating stigmatized individuals whose status differs across cultures (older adults). Using a social neuroscience approach can provide unique insight into this question because the neural regions involved in cognitive and affective evaluations of stigmatized individuals have been well characterized. Results revealed that Chinese participants and Caucasian-American participants engaged similar patterns of negative affective processing associated with disgust (left anterior insula) when evaluating homeless individuals. Moreover, self-reported negative explicit attitudes toward homeless individuals were associated with increased activity in the insula. However, Chinese participants and Caucasian-American participants engaged increased activity in neural regions associated with status (ventral striatum) when they evaluated older adults. Moreover, self-reported attitudes toward older adults and ventral striatal activity were correlated with the extent to which participants reported being affiliated with their respective cultural traditions.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Low levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and its product, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), play a critical role in intestinal homeostasis while high levels of COX-2 and PGE have been implicated in the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). PGE2 acts on 4 EP receptors (EP1-EP4) leading to differential downstream effects. Modulation of COX-2 and PGE2 levels may be a potential treatment for NEC; yet global inhibition of COX-2 may be detrimental for intestinal barrier function. Previous work in our lab has shown that COX-2 can be induced by PGE2 via EP2 receptor activation in vitro likely contributing to the high levels of COX-2 and runaway inflammation seen in NEC. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that selective EP2 inhibition, but not global inhibition of COX-2, would decrease the incidence and severity of experimental NEC. Method(s): Neonatal rat pups were subjected to a regimen of formula feeding and hypoxia three times daily for 4 days. Formula contained a known NEC pathogen, Cronobacter muytjensii (CM), at 10^7 CFU with or without the COX-2 inhibitor, Celecoxib 0.1 mg/kg/day, or EP2 antagonist PF-04418948 10 mg/kg/day. Terminal ileum was harvested on day of life 4 for NEC scoring, real time PCR analysis, and histological staining. A score of 2 or greater was considered NEC. Result(s): Treatment with a COX-2 inhibitor increased mean NEC score from 1.2 to 1.4 and increased the incidence of NEC from 40% to 57% compared with CM controls. However, treatment with an EP2 antagonist decreased mean NEC score from 1.5 to 1 (p < 0.05) and decreased the incidence of NEC from 58% to 24% (p < 0.05) compared with CM controls. Treatment with an EP2 antagonist decreased COX-2 protein expression as seen on histologic staining and decreased COX-2 mRNA expression to 0.37 fold control levels (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): EP2 receptor inhibition, but not COX-2 inhibition, decreases the incidence and severity of experimental NEC. An EP2 receptor antagonist also decreases COX-2 protein expression and mRNA expression in terminal ileal samples. This suggests that blocking specific downstream effects of COX-2 and PGE2 via EP2 may inhibit the inflammatory cascade seen in NEC while maintaining the homeostatic properties of COX-2. Treatment with an EP2 receptor antagonist may have important therapeutic implications in the treatment of NEC.

N2  - Objective: To determine the relationship between food consumption patterns and prevalence of food insecurity among Trinidadian adults. Method(s): A convenience sample of two hundred and twenty selected households participated in the study. Data were collected over a three-month period in the year 2015. A structured paper-based questionnaire was used to collect data on HIV knowledge, food consumption frequency, food security status and sexual risk behaviours. Principal component analysis was used to derive dietary patterns. Multiple logistic regression models were used to determine the association between household food security and HIV knowledge and dietary pattern scores. All models were adjusted for gender, age, ethnicity, employment status and educational status. Result(s): Two dietary consumption patterns were identified, namely westernized and prudent patterns. Overall, household food insecurity was approximately 65%, with food insecurity with children being that of 41% and without children 63%. Average HIV knowledge was 61.48+/-15.16% among participants. Higher HIV knowledge (OR = 0.84; p = 0.002) and prudent dietary factor scores (OR = 0.64; p < 0.001) were associated with a greater odds of being food secure. Conversely, higher westernized dietary factor scores (OR = 1.33; p = 0.008) were associated with a greater likelihood of being food insecure. Conclusion(s): Greater awareness to HIV and healthier dietary patterns were seen among individuals from food secure households while persons who had westernized lifestyles were more likely to be from food insecure households. A greater effort is needed by governmental and public health institutions to help reduce the burden of food insecurity in the Caribbean.

N2  - Background: In the US, there are approximately 1.6 million homeless youth annually. Compared to housed youth, homeless youth are more likely to engage in high risk behaviors, including early sexual debut, inconsistent condom use, multiple sex partners, survival sex and alcohol/drug use, putting them at increased risk for acquiring STDs. However, there is no national estimate of STD prevalence among this population. This review documents STD prevalence among homeless youth and identifies associations with behavioral factors.

N2  - Introduction: The standard approach between Emergency Departments (EDs) and Psychiatric Emergency Services is to medically "clear" a stable patient of organic pathology prior to psychiatric consultation. Medical clearance involves neuroimaging, typically in the form of a computed tomography (CT) head scan. This study examines the clinical impact of ordering CT head scans for patients presenting with bizarre behaviour. Method(s): A 5-year retrospective chart review was conducted at 3 academic, urban ED sites. Inclusion criteria were patients >=18 years of age triaged as "mental health - bizarre behavior" (defined as deviating from normal cognitive behaviour with no obvious cause) with a CT head scan ordered while under the care of the ED. Exclusion criteria were focal neurologic deficits on exam, alternative medical etiology (i.e. delirium, trauma) and/or pre-existing CNS disease. Demographic, administrative, and neuroimaging data were extracted with 10% of charts independently reviewed by a staff Emergency Physician for inter-rater reliability. Result(s): 270 cases met study criteria. CT results were unavailable in 3, leaving 267 cases studied. The population demographics were: 49% percent female, average age 51 years old, 28% homeless, 59% arrived by police and/or ambulance. CT head results demonstrated 1 (0.4%) case with possible acute findings on CT. 108 (40%) had incidental findings (i.e. cerebral atrophy, small hypodensities), none of which impacted clinical management. Average time to physician assessment was 1 hour 58 minutes (sd 1:17) and time to CT head completion was 6 hours 50 minutes (sd 7:20) leaving an average of 4 hours 52 minutes awaiting these results. Ultimately 86% of patients were referred to a consultant of which 92% were to Psychiatry. Conclusion(s): This study of CT head scans for bizarre behavior ED presentations showed that the CT results did not change the clinical management of the patient. Furthermore, awaiting these results prolonged ED length of stay and delayed patient disposition. A prospective trial of a clinical decision tool for ordering CT head scans in these patients is warranted.

N2  - Study Objectives: Emergency care sits at the interface of many aspects of health care and social issues. Public intoxication (PI) is a health care, criminal justice, social, substance use and personal issue that impacts the criminal justice system, Emergency Medical services (EMS) and hospital emergency departments (ED). The purpose is to describe the impact of a natural experiment of an urban jail diversion program to a sobering center (SC). This center was initiated April 2013 as a police department (PD) jail diversion effort and has developed into a community resource. Method(s): The City of Houston created a publicly funded SC facility, focused on jail diversions of public inebriates (PI) who are at least 18 years old and in police custody for PI. Individuals who were driving while intoxicated, violent, combative, involved in criminal activity or non-ambulatory due to impairment were not eligible for SC diversion. Eligible inebriates were brought to the sobering center by PD and could choose to stay in lieu of going to jail. Result(s): After opening of the SC, the city's per month mean of PI arrests decreased from 1395 to 161 (n= 41 pre; 28 post; t=23.8, p <000, F=29.072). In the first 20 months of SC operation the city realized an estimated net positive fiscal impact of $2.9 million which includes facility start-up, operational and lease costs. For the first year of operation (April 2013-2014), the SC received 5,659 diversions. Sobering center diversions were concentrated on the weekends with 39% of clients received on Saturdays and Sundays. SC client demographics were, 54% white, 25% black, 19% Hispanic, with age evenly distributed across 18 to 55 years old. First time SC clients were more likely to be younger, and 34% of all clients were homeless. During the first year, 161 frequent clients, defined as those admitted at least 3 times, represented 972 diversions or 17% of the total. Admission to the SC included formal PD hand off, initial EMT screening and a voluntary stay. Individuals with acute medical issues were transported to an ED by EMS. Logistical issues for start-up included defining appropriate inebriate inclusion criteria; communication of entry process to PD; creation of an efficient hand off of inebriates to SC; and coordinating with existing community resources for recovery referrals. During the clients' stay and at discharge, all individuals were offered recovery information and support, substance use counseling and referrals for services. The SC creation has served as an impetus for improved coordination and funding of community recovery services. Conclusion(s): An urban jail diversion for inebriates in police custody for PI to a sobering center resulted in a significant drop in police arrests for PI and substantial positive fiscal impact for the city. A large population of individuals were voluntarily provided a safe place for sobering, individual peer coaching and counseling. This effort has significant implications for urban areas and may have a substantial impact on the criminal justice system, EMS, emergency care and community recovery services.

N2  - Introduction: Traditionally, assessments of instrumental activities of daily living in the elderly have been based on self-reports, but concerns about underestimating impairment have led to studies of directly observed function (Diehl et al., 1995). The Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program at the Connecticut VA aims to provide housing assistance to patients who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Several studies have reported a high prevalence of both cognitive and functional impairment among homeless adults, even at as young as age 50 (Depp et al., 2015). This population often lacks collateral sources of information to confirm functional status. Therefore, we aim to utilize a directly observed assessment of function in a geriatric syndrome screening clinic that was established in collaboration with the HCHV at VA Connecticut. Method(s): As part of a collaborative quality improvement project, patients presenting to the homeless clinic at VA Connecticut were seen in the Screening PRogram to Identify Needs due to Geriatric Syndromes (SPRING) clinic. Patients were 18 years old or older, eligible for VA benefits, and homeless or at risk for homelessness. Patients received either a full or a partial screening as part of this project. The full screening included a revised form of the Direct Assessment of Functional Status (DAFS-R; McDougall et al., 2010) to assess skills in the domains of communication, finance, shopping, and medication management. In addition, subjective measures of functional status [Modified Katz Activities of Daily Living Scale, Brief Instrumental Functional Scale (BIFS)], depression screening (Patient Health Questionnaire 9), and cognitive assessments [Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Trail Making Test Part B (Trails B) are performed. The DAFS-R contains 55 items that assess the skills required for communication (using a phone and mailing a letter), financial affairs (counting currency and balancing checkbooks), shopping (recalling a shopping list and choosing the shopping list items from a shelf ), and medication management (identifying information on a prescription bottle, using a telephone for prescription refills, and managing medications in a pillbox.) Partial screening includes the subjective measures of functional status, depression screening, and the cognitive assessments. After assessments, clinicians reviewed the results of the full screenings and engaged patients in a planning conversation regarding further evaluation and treatment. The ultimate goal of this project is to identify and address functional impairment as a means of improving housing and health outcomes. Here we report the results of directly observed functional testing, as well as the associations with subjective measures of function and cognitive screening. Result(s): A total of 17 patients received a full assessment including directly observed assessment of function. Average age was 55.8 +/- 10.2 years and 93.4% were male. Patients reported an average education level of 12.7 +/- 1.3 years. Based on chart diagnoses, 50.0% had a mood disorder, 37.5% an anxiety disorder, 12.5% a psychotic disorder, 43.8% an alcohol use disorder, 6.3% an opioid use disorder, and 18.8% a stimulant use disorder. Four patients (25%) had a chart diagnosis of MCI or dementia. None of the patients had a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury or stroke recorded in the chart. One patient (6.3%) had a seizure disorder. On direct assessment of functional status (DAFS-R), the mean score was 45.6 +/- 8.2 (max score possible of 57). DAFS-R score was significantly correlated with MoCA score (r2 = 0.2399, p < 0.05, Spearman correlation, Figure 1), but not with Trails B alone. Patients that had cognitive impairment (MoCA < 26 represented by horizontal red dotted line in Figure 1, or Trails B < -1.5 standard deviations below age and education adjusted norms) scored significantly lower on the DAFS-R than those without cognitive impairment (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Figure 2). Importantly, subjective assessments of function completed by asking a patient about their needs using the BIFS had no correlation with the DAFS-R, MoCA, or Trails B. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates the need for directly observed assessments of function in homeless patients. Impairments are both prevalent and under-recognized by assessments based only on subjective interview. Identification and support of functional impairment may be an important intervention for patients with unstable housing whose impairment may contribute to continued housing instability or homelessness. Future goals of our work are to explore the relationship between housing instability and functional impairment and evaluate the impact of the SPRING clinic intervention on housing outcomes.

N2  - Purpose: Severe frostbite frequently results in ischemia with devastating tissue injury leading to limb amputation. Although historically frostbite injuries were predominantly seen with military work, the last 2 decades have seen a rise in civilian cases, usually associated with winter sports, homelessness, and alcohol consumption. There is a paucity of double-blind randomized trials and grade 1 recommendations regarding the treatment of frostbite injury; however, the last decade has presented a growing body of evidence supporting the use of thrombolytic therapy leading to decreased amputation rates. Our aim is to present a comprehensive review of current management of frostbite injury and what every endovascular specialist needs to know when evaluating and treating frostbite injury. Material(s) and Method(s): We present a case of successful revascularization following catheter-directed intra-arterial thrombolyis in a 20-year-old male who suffered third-degree upper extremity frostbite injury. Angiogram of the right upper extremity demonstrated severe hypoperfusion of the right third, fourth, and fifth digits. Along with a comprehensive literature review of this treatment and current recommendations for the management of frostbite injury, we discuss the indication, techniques, and potential complications of this interventional radiological approach. Result(s): Following infusion catheter placement within the distal ulnar artery and a 24-hour infusion of tissue plasminogen activator and heparin, follow-up angiograph demonstrated complete reperfusion of all digits. The need for surgical amputation was avoided without procedure-related complications. At 1-month clinical follow-up, the patient demonstrated complete return of function and full range of motion of all digits. Conclusion(s): Frostbite injuries are seen at an increasing rate, and there is an increasing body of evidence supporting the use of thrombolytic therapy for its management. Interventional radiologists should be familiar with the current management of frostbite injury and should play a critical role in the multidisciplinary special trauma team to minimize final tissue loss and maximize functionality of the affected limb.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: An estimated 8.4% of Americans suffer from substance-use disorder (SUD). The incidence increases to nearly 50% in patients suffering from concurrent schizophrenia. Current evidence is inconclusive for the effects of antipsychotic medications in patients with schizophrenia and SUD with regards to reducing substance use and SUD-related hospital readmission. RESEARCH QUESTION OR HYPOTHESIS: In patients with concurrent schizophrenia and SUD (amphetamine and cocaine), is the initiation of anti-psychotics upon discharge associated with a reduction in future substance use-related readmission? STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study utilizing electronic medical records (EMR). METHOD(S): Patients admitted with schizophrenia and SUD between 1/1/2005-12/31/2015 at a county hospital were identified. Inclusion criteria were documented schizophrenia, SUD, and no antipsychotic use at index admission; exclusion criteria were patients < 18 years old or unavailable EMR. Included for review were 126 patients. EMRs were then examined for anti-psychotics given at discharge from index admission and subsequent SUD related readmission. Fisher's Exact, Mann-Whitney, and unpaired t-tests were used for analysis with a p-value <= 0.05 deemed statistically significant. The primary endpoint is SUD-related readmission. Secondary endpoints are the number of days to readmission and identifying other potential risk factors for readmission. RESULT(S): The percentage of readmitted patients initially discharged with an antipsychotic medication at index admission was 18.3% compared to 18.2% for patients discharged without an antipsychotic medication (p-value >0.99). Average days to readmission for patients discharged with and without an antipsychotic medication were 441 and 670, respectively (p-value=0.47). Potential risk factors analyzed for readmission were homelessness (p-value=0.14), smoking (p-value=0.85), and alcohol use (p-value=0.60). CONCLUSION(S): Study results indicate that discharging patients with an antipsychotic was not associated with reduced SUDrelated readmission or increase in the number of days to readmission. Furthermore, potential risk factors were not associated with an increase in SUD-related readmissions.

T1  - Housing first "junior": Testing a complex psychosocial intervention designed for homeless adults with mental illness in homeless youth
T3  - 63rd Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. New York, NY United States.

N2  - Objectives: With high rates of mental and substance use disorders, physical illness, and increased mortality, homeless transitional age youth are one of our most vulnerable populations. Despite this statistic, there is a dearth of research on effective interventions for homeless youth. We describe findings from an adult trial and how they may be applied to generate evidence to serve homeless youth. Method(s): At Home/Chez Soi was a 24-month randomized controlled trial of the Housing First model for homeless individuals with mental illness in five Canadian cities. Housing First combines the choice of scattered-site housing (without stipulating receipt of psychiatric treatment or sobriety) with access to intensive psychosocial services according to the level of need. Baseline measures were completed by 2,255 homeless people with serious mental illness, of whom 7 percent (n = 164) were youth aged 24 years and under. We examined differences between youth and older participants and compared the impact of the intervention with treatment as usual on housing stability and other outcomes over 24 months. Result(s): Compared with adults, youth were less likely to have completed high school and received regular medical care and more likely to have a drug use disorder, have been assaulted in the past 6 months, and have a learning disability. In an adjusted analysis, youth in Housing First were stably housed 65.1 percent of the 24 months compared with youth in treatment as usual, who were stably housed 30.7 percent of the time, resulting in an adjusted mean difference of 34.4 percent (95% CI 24.4-44.5, P < 0.0001). Receipt of Housing First was not associated with significant differences in other exploratory outcomes among youth. Conclusion(s): Despite significant differences from homeless adults with mental illness, homeless youth with mental illness seem to benefit from Housing First as designed for adults. Subgroup analysis from adult trials is one way to generate research on complex psychosocial interventions in youth, with the goal of evaluating and adapting interventions more fully to serve the most vulnerable and marginalized populations.

N2  - Objectives: Given the lack of evidence for interventions targeting housing outcomes in transitional-age homeless youth (ages 18-24 years), we aimed to test the effect of Housing First on housing stability among a group of homeless youth with mental illness enrolled in At Home/Chez Soi, a $110 million 24- month randomized controlled trial of Housing First in five Canadian cities. Method(s): Homeless individuals with mental illness were randomized to receive Housing First, a scattered-site choice-based housing intervention (without preconditions of sobriety or psychiatric treatment) and mental health services according to the level of need (assertive community treatment or intensive case management), or usual care. Participants completed interviews every 6 months and measures of housing status every 3 months to a total of 24 months. We assessed housing stability as percent days stably housed as a proportion of days for which residence data were available in youth aged 18-24 years, fit a model with a three-way interaction of treatment group (age 18-24 years vs. >24 years), and compared the effect on housing stability in youth versus adults. We used a repeated measures mixed-effects model to estimate differences/ratios from baseline over 24 months for secondary health and service use outcomes. Result(s): Of the 2,148 total participants who were randomized, 156 were youth aged 18-24 years: 87 received Housing First and 69 received usual care. In an adjusted analysis, youth in Housing First were stably housed a mean of 437/645 (65 percent) days for which data were available compared with youth in usual care, who were stably housed a mean of 189/582 (31 percent) days, resulting in an adjusted mean difference of 34 percent (95% CI 24-45, P < 0.0001). The effect of the three-way interaction of treatment group, age, and time on housing stability was nonsignificant (P = 0.5934). Youth who received Housing First were less likely to have a period of employment (adjusted OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.24-0.99, P = 0.0456), but otherwise, their secondary outcomes were not significantly different from youth who received usual care. Conclusion(s): Housing First led to improved housing stability in homeless youth with mental illness and appears to be no less effective in youth than in older adults. More research is needed to guide adaptations of the model to further improve housing stability and other outcomes in youth.

T1  - New intervention approaches for disruptive behavior disorders: Considering risks and underlying mechanisms
T3  - 63rd Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. New York, NY United States.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Objectives: Disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) constitute one of the most frequent presenting complaints to mental health professionals. DBDs are strongly linked to long-lasting negative outcomes and a high risk for developing antisocial personality disorder (APD) in adulthood, thereby underlining the need for evidence-based intervention programs. Effective treatment approaches for DBD and APD must acknowledge the heterogeneity of underlying psychosocial and biological risk factors. The emerging neuroscience behind DBD and APD combined with research on psychological and social risk factors has opened a new series of promising interventional approaches. Method(s): Drs. Niranjan S. Karnik and Joerg Fegert presented prevalence rates based on multivariate analyses. Dr. Robert L. Trestman describes the treatment effects of an intervention for correctional populations within the United States and its analysis within a zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis. Dr. Lilian Konicar examined the effectiveness of neurofeedback via t-tests and correlational and regression analyses. Result(s): The present symposium will provide data on the prevalence of negative psychosocial experiences and associated psychopathology in children and adolescents living in residential care settings. Subsequent talks will focus on innovative intervention approaches intended to improve the underlying deficient biological mechanisms, such as impaired emotion processing in patients with DBD/APD, or reduce relevant risk factors and improve psychosocial adjustment of incarcerated and homeless populations. An evidence-informed intervention program provided at multiple correctional facilities throughout the United States to reduce problem behavior and enhance emotional stability will be introduced, in addition to an ongoing, multicenter RCT currently conducted in several European countries. Conclusion(s): Adolescents living in high risk environments exhibit a high prevalence of mental health problems, which strongly underlines the need for evidence-based treatments. Each of the presented intervention approaches specifically targeting underserved populations are effective in reducing problem behavior and enhancing emotional stability. Implications for treatment and an enhanced standard of care are discussed, along with challenges and limitations.

N2  - Objectives: Very few studies have investigated executive function (EF) in homeless youth, and those that have studied EF typically used a limited number of subjects and assessment options. By use of a sample group larger than any in the current literature and a full neuropsychological battery, this study examined the relationship between components of EF and engagement in risk-taking behaviors among shelter-living urban homeless youth. Method(s): From 2011 to 2016, 149 homeless youths (aged 18-24 years) underwent neuropsychological testing as part of the Homeless Youth Study. This investigation draws from that larger dataset, specifically the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning Adult Version (BRIEF-A), National Youth Risk Behavior Survey, and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Result(s): Findings indicate a significant relationship between developing EFs and risk-taking behaviors in these homeless youths. Specifically, we found that those with lower EF ability had higher rates of engagement in several risk-taking behaviors. Conclusion(s): Although further investigation is needed, identifying low EF as an indicator of likely engagement in risky behaviors has the potential for guiding earlier intervention and more positive outcomes for these youths.

T1  - Does parental executive function moderate the relationship between household food insecurity, diet quality, and child psychiatric symptoms?

N2  - Objectives: The present study examines the relationships between household food insecurity (HFS) and child psychiatric problems and diet quality and investigates the ways in which parental behavior and cognition may serve as risk or protective factors for children in food-insecure households. Method(s): A total of 70 families, containing three members and at least one child between the ages of 7 and 17 years, participated in the study. The US Department of Agriculture Household Food Security Survey, CBCL/6-18, and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A) were used to measure HFS during the past 12 months, child psychiatric symptoms, and parent executive functioning (EF), respectively. Diet quality was assessed by 24-hour food recall. Multiple ANCOVA and linear regression analyses were performed in SPSS, version 22. Result(s): After controlling for socioeconomic status (SES), there was an independent effect of HFS on scores on the attention (ATT) and somatic (SOM) CBCL subscales, with children in food-secure households showing fewer problems. There was an independent effect of HFS on daily calorie, fat, and protein intake, with children in households with low food security consuming more than children in households that were either food secure or had very low food security. There was also a significant interaction effect of HFS and SES on scores on ATT, thought problems (TP), and anxious-depressed (A/D) subscales. There was a significant moderating effect of parental EF on the relationship between HFS and child psychiatric symptoms. Parental emotional control significantly attenuated children's A/D symptoms and had a marginally significant effect on SOM, TP, and ATT problems. Parental scores in self-monitoring, initiating, and planning/organizing domains also had marginally significant, attenuating effects on the relationship between HFS and A/D symptoms. Conclusion(s): These findings support previous work that suggests that HFS is associated with diet quality and child mental health. These results suggest that parents' EF skills may moderate the association between HFS and child psychiatric symptoms, particularly anxiety/depression. However, these skills do not seem to influence the child's diet quality. Further research is needed to refine the specific mechanisms by which certain domains of parental EF may protect children in food-insecure households from negative psychiatric outcomes and assess the efficacy of interventions designed to enhance these skills.

N2  - Background and aims Coming-out (CO) to parents and siblings is a central moment in LGBTQ's life. If breaking the news is followed by a welcoming attitude, the experience of relief has major implications on health and self-esteem. In contrast, CO can trigger verbal or physical violence, rejection or expulsion from home. Such family conflicts often result in homelessness, and increase the risk of mental health problems and suicide. The role of health care providers in supporting CO is poorly defined. We aimed to identify strategies for pediatricians to support LGBTQ adolescents for their CO to parents and siblings, particularly when family dynamics predict a high likelihood of violence and rejection. Methods Strategies were identified from literature review and through case analysis of LGBTQ adolescents treated in an outpatient clinic, who were at high risk of family rejection and violence. Cases were systematically discussed in an interdisciplinary team, who explored and iteratively refined strategies to support CO. Results We identified 8 dimensions to consider in the planning, support and follow-up of CO, which we organized around the acronym TRANS (see table). Conclusions Health care providers, and in particular pediatricians, can play a central role in supporting youth at high-risk of rejection and violence. Beyond breaking the news; CO is an ongoing process that requires long-term follow-up. Our suggested framework can help pediatricians accompany LGBTQ adolescents across this vulnerable and key moment in their life.(Table Presented).

N2  - Learning Objectives: Homeless patients in the United States are at increased risk for acute illnesses. However, the impact of homelessness on mortality and length of stay (LOS) in patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is understudied. Method(s): A retrospective observational study was conducted using data from the multi-center Premier Perspective Database from 2010 to 2011. Study inclusion criteria included being age 18 or older and in the ICU by Day 2. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and LOS. LOS was analyzed for survivors only as a sensitivity analysis. Homeless patients were identified by ICD-9 code V60.0. Using ICD-9 codes, three subpopulations were identified: sepsis patients treated with antibiotics by Day 2, patients with pneumonia present on admission, and patients with an Alcohol or Drug related DRG. We used multivariable logistic regression to predict mortality and multivariable generalized regression with a logarithmic link function to predict LOS. All models adjusted for age, demographics, insurance type, Elixhauser comorbidities, organ supportive therapies and other treatments. Result(s): 781,540 patients met inclusion criteria. 2,278 (0.29%) were homeless. There were 93,059 sepsis patients (230 (0.3%) homeless), 68,817 pneumonia patients (190 (0.3%) homeless), and 35,620 with Alcohol or Drug DRGs (628 (1.8%) homeless). The regression models showed no significant difference in mortality between homeless and non-homeless patients in the three groups. However, LOS was substantially longer in homeless patients with sepsis (4.2 days longer, 95% CI (1.8, 6.5), p < 0.001) and pneumonia (2.1 days longer, 95% CI (0.3, 4.0), p = 0.03). LOS did not differ in the Alcohol and Drug related DRG group. The sensitivity analysis on LOS for survivors produced similar findings. Conclusion(s): Critically ill homeless patients with sepsis or pneumonia had longer lengths of stay than in non-homeless patients but LOS did not differ in patients with alcohol or drug related diagnoses. Homelessness was not associated with increased mortality in these critically ill groups.

N2  - Background: HIV viral suppression is critical to achieving benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART) not only for individual health, but also for prevention of onward HIV transmission. Limited data on viral suppression derive from key populations in low-and-middle-income countries where these groups continue to experience disproportionately high rates of HIV transmission. Method(s): We recruited 12,022 men who have sex with men (MSM) and 14,481 people who inject drugs (PWID) across 27 cities in India (target=1000 per site) using respondentdriven sampling from 10/2012 - 9/2013. Participants had to be >=18 years old and self-identify as male and report sex with a man in the prior year (MSM) or report injection drug use in the prior 2 years (PWID). 1,146 MSM and 2906 PWID were HIV positive. We characterize barriers and facilitators of viral suppression (HIV RNA<150 copies/ml) among ART initiators using multi-level logistic regression. Result(s): Of HIV positive MSM and PWID, 347 (25%) and 595 (24%) initiated ART, respectively. Median age was 35 years, 33% had primary school education or less and 44% of PWID were female. 67% of PWID reported active drug injection; 16% and 21% of MSM and PWID, respectively, had evidence of alcohol dependence. Of those who initiated ART, 268 (78%) of MSM and 443 (77%) of PWID were virally suppressed. Barriers to viral suppression among both groups included homelessness and harmful/hazardous alcohol use or alcohol dependence (Table). Among PWID, active drug injection was an additional barrier to suppression and women were significantly more likely to be suppressed than men. Among MSM, higher educational attainment was significantly associated with viral suppression. Neither needle exchange nor opioid substitution was associated with suppression among PWID. Adjustment for adherence (visual analogue scale) or premature discontinuation did not substantially attenuate these associations. Conclusion(s): Levels of viral suppression among those on ART in this population were high, but are still short of new UNAIDS targets. Moreover, while viral suppression among those on ART was high, overall viral suppression (19% among MSM and 18% among PWID) was suboptimal such that population viral suppression will only be achieved through broad-based interventions that simultaneously support testing, linkage and adherence. Interventions need to be targeted towards those with active substance use, as they may also be most likely to transmit HIV to others. (Table Presented).

Calls Received: The CF Hotline received 7079 calls in 2015, an increase of 13% over calls in 2014. B. Age of Subject: More calls related to adults with CF at 59% (4183) and 41% (2896) of all calls related to children. C. Caller Type: Calls from adults with CF were 44.4% of all calls (3143), an increase of 24% over 2014. CF center staff made up 31% (2198) of all calls, an increase of 10% over 2014. Calls from a parent of a person with CF were 23.2% (1645) of all calls, an increase of 6% since 2014. Calls from spouses or friends of a person with CF were 1.4% (93) of all calls. D. Subject Matter of Calls: Calls were in five major categories: health benefits and coverage; Social Security benefits; employment; education; and miscellaneous subjects. 1. Health Benefits and Coverage. Calls related to health benefit plans were 27% of all calls (1888/7079), a decrease of 2% compared to 2014. Among the 1888 calls regarding health benefits, 24% (444) related to benefits under individual or group plans, a decrease of 50% from 2014. Most calls in this category, 70% (1313) related to health benefit coverage under Medicare or Medicaid, an increase of 52%. Significantly, only 40 calls were from individuals with no coverage in 2015, a decrease of 48% from 2014. 2. Social Security. Calls related to Social Security benefits were 59% (4166/7079) of all calls, an increase of 40%. Of these, 55% (2305/4166) related to Supplemental Security Income benefits, a 48% increase from 2014. 45% of calls related to Social Security Disability Insurance benefits which is a 30% increase. 3. Education. Accessing education accounted for 9% (654) of all calls, a 17% decrease from 2014. 4. Employment. Employment-related calls were only 5% (342), a decrease of 20% compared to 2014. 5. Miscellaneous Subjects. Miscellaneous subjects accounted for only 0.4% of all calls, a decrease of 77% from 2014. Conclusion(s): Adults with CF continue to need an accurate resource for information on legal issues as nearly two-thirds of all calls related to adults. Also, the CF Hotline remains an important resource for CF care center staff for information on the rights of their patients as 1 in 3 calls is from a member of a CF Center team. The number of calls related to health insurance coverage has decreased as the Affordable Care Act has made obtaining and maintaining health coverage easier. Information on maintaining Social Security benefits or understanding complex benefit eligibility criteria is critical to many with CF who rely on benefits for monthly income support and access to health insurance coverage. Callers repeatedly reported difficulty accessing correct information about Social Security benefits until they spoke to the CF Hotline. Nearly half of all callers had questions about Social Security benefits or eligibility, and nearly half who called about health benefits inquired about Medicare or Medicaid benefits. Based on reports from callers it is clear that without access to the CF Hotline the most vulnerable members of the CF community would be at risk of becoming homeless or have no access to the crucial healthcare they need to fight CF.

N2  - Background: Rotavirus is the leading cause of diarrhoea worldwide in children < 5 years. Although mortality rates are low in Ireland, certain populations are more vulnerable to the associated morbidity and mortality of infection, particularly children with inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs). Rotavirus can result in acute decompensation, lactic acidosis, liver dysfunction and death in this population. The aim of this study was to evaluate children with IMDs who had confirmed rotavirus and compare the investigations, management and outcome with controls with rotavirus. We aim to highlight the importance of introducing the rotavirus vaccination in this vulnerable population. Method(s): Patients with confirmed rotavirus was obtained from the microbiology laboratory over the last 5 years in Temple Street Children's Hospital, Dublin. 14 patients with confirmed IMDs who were admitted with rotavirus were evaluated for details in terms of initial presentation, investigations and management. They were compared with 19 randomly selected age matched controls; children without IMDs who were also admitted with rotavirus infection. A retrospective chart review was conducted along with a review of the hospital laboratory system. Result(s): The median length of stay was 7 days in IMD patients versus 2 days in the controls. IV fluids were required on average for 4.57 days (SD 4.27) in IMD versus 1.05 days (SD 0.8) in controls. 2 IMD patients required a central line and 7 required total parental nutrition (TPN) compared to zero controls. Bloods were performed on average 8.53 times (SD 5.71) in IMD patients versus 2.5 times (SD 2.65) in the controls. Discussion(s): The rotavirus vaccination has been proven to be highly effective in reducing hospital admissions and mortality worldwide. As demonstrated in the IMD cohort, it leads to significant decompensation and morbidity in this population. The introduction of the rotavirus vaccine would offer additional protection to this vulnerable cohort.

N2  - Background/introduction Homeless adults and street based sex workers are a highly vulnerable group of people with specific sexual and general health needs. A specialist outreach clinic was set up in 2010 to support these patients. Aim(s)/objectives To evaluate the uptake of services used including contraception, immunisation, blood-borne virus testing, cytology, STI screening and evaluation of drug use. Methods Data was retrospectively collected from May 2012 until March 2015. Results 82 patients seen in total (female, 53; male, 29), with an average age of 28.6 (range 17-50.) 57% of patients were symptomatic. 57% patients (n = 47) were Hepatitis B immune, 26% (n = 21) received either boosters or full vaccination for HBV. 34% patients (n = 28) had STIs. Hepatitis C (36%) and Chlamydia (32%) were the most common infections. 57% patients (n = 47) were using drugs, the majority using heroin (57%). 3 females were pregnant at baseline review; of the remaining women, 78% (n = 39) were on contraception, LARCs being the most widely used. 34% of women (n = 18) were working as commercial sex workers. 35 of the women had given birth to a total of 97 children, with 70% of them (n = 68) either fostered or adopted. 33% smears taken (n = 10) were abnormal with 3 colposcopy referrals. Discussion/conclusion This specialist outreach clinic facilitates sexual and reproductive healthcare for vulnerable patients who are otherwise hard to reach and often have poor experiences of healthcare. The high rate of sex work in this population emphasises the need for continued screening and treatment. LARC uptake rates are reassuring, but could be further improved.

N2  - Purpose: Mental health symptoms and substance use behaviors are among the most commonly reported health deficits among runaway/homeless youth (RHY). When RHY actively seek out safety in shelter programs, this presents a unique opportunity to extricate a young person from trauma on the streets and address health concerns at point-of-care. The purpose of the current study is to describe initial findings from a feasibility trial of a universal screening and brief intervention pilot in an urban runaway/ homeless youth shelter. Mental health screening was incorporated in the shelter admissions process, and lay youth workers were trained to deliver motivational interview as a brief intervention to address mental health distress and substance use behaviors within days of admission. Method(s): We used Interpretive Description qualitative methods to analyze one-to-one key informant interviews (n= 15) of youth 2-3 weeks after shelter admission. The interview guide included questions about their intake experience, the screening and brief intervention (SBI) procedure, and questions of patient-centered behavior change resulting from the SBI. We also analyzed summary statistics of intake demographic items, and the PHQ-9, the scale used to measure emotional distress at intake, to inform the motivational interview content. Result(s): Just over 50% of our sample reported moderate to severe emotional distress at intake. In the first 3 months, 4 youth reported acute suicidal thinking and were linked to crisis mental health referral within 24 hours of screening. Themes from the interviews included: intake process was simple; case management made youth feel cared for, and their immediate emotional health needs met; and the one-to-one time with case managers helped youth prioritize their mental health in context of the transition to housing . Conclusion(s): In the first three months of our pilot SBI intake procedure, we were able to screen 94% of RHY entering shelter services, and target delivery of brief intervention to 80% of them based on their intake PHQ-9 scores or other subjective admissions needs. Youth report the intake process was innocuous and akin to other residential admission processes. Anecdotal reports from staff validated this finding, adding that there was little additional work added to the intake process. The motivational interview brief intervention appears to prioritize mental health needs in the context of other basic needs during shelter stay for the youth. Social service agencies can implement a SBI program easily, with little added expense for training, to create a more streamlined behavioral health network of care.

N2  - Purpose: Young homeless women are at high risk for substance use and risky sexual behaviors, but few interventions have addressed these issues with this population. The purpose of this analysis was to determine the feasibility of using goal-attainment scaling (GAS) to assess to what extent young women attending an intervention based on enhancing psychological capital met or exceeded short-term goals they set as part of the intervention. Method(s): A quasi-experimental feasibility design was used. Homeless young women between 18-23 years of age were assigned to an intervention or comparison group. The four-session intervention groups discussed concepts of hope, resilience, optimism, social connectedness, self-efficacy, responsible substance use, safe sexual behavior, and goal setting. Sample: 54 young women were assigned to 9 intervention groups with an average age of 21. Thirty-seven percent were Latina, 26% White, 14% Black, and remaining participants declined to answer or gave variable responses. Only 40 participants attended the last session in which they identified goals to work on during the subsequent month, but 12 of these were lost to follow-up. The final sample was 28. Protocol: After obtaining informed, signed consents, participants were assigned to intervention or comparison groups. At the conclusion of the intervention groups, each participant who attended set a goal that could be met within one month's time. These goals were intended to be specific, unidimensional, measurable behaviors, that were realistic, and achievable within one month. Group facilitators translated these goals into a 5-point scale (-2 to +2 with 0 = goal) for each participant. With the zero value set as meeting the goal, behaviors that were more or less than goal achievement were set as -2, -1, or +1, +2. Each participant received a cell phone with a one-month package so they could receive phone calls from their group facilitator who encouraged them to take steps to meet their goals. One month following the conclusion of the intervention group, an assistant who had not delivered the intervention, collected the final goal attainment data and rated the participant's achievement. This was done to reduce social desirability. Result(s): At one-month follow-up, 23 of the 28 participants (82%) had attained or exceeded the goals they set. Goals were directly related to the immediate needs of the young women and included such things as getting housing or finding a job. These goals were personally meaningful to the young women. Discussion(s): A limitation of this study was the large amount of attrition both during the intervention and during the follow-up period. Nevertheless, 70% of women who attended the last session were able to set realistic and achievable goals that were directly related to their lives, which is a new addition to the literature on homeless youth. Conclusion(s): Use of GAS is feasible with this population, at least for achieving relatively short-term goals with direct applicability to these young women's lives. The process of GAS also provided valuable insights into the priorities of this vulnerable group of young women.

N2  - Purpose: Homeless young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 exhibit high rates of alcohol use, as well as drug use and sexual risk behaviors. Yet few risk reduction programs exist for this at-risk population, particularly ones that are both effective and can be easily incorporated into settings serving this population (e.g., drop-in centers). This study addresses an important gap in prevention services for homeless emerging adults by conducting a pilot cluster cross-over randomized controlled trial of AWARE, a group-MI (Motivational Interviewing) brief risk reduction intervention focusing on reducing both substance use and sexual risk behavior. Method(s): AWARE consists of four 45-min sessions. Rolling admission is used so that youth can join the program at any time, regardless of session. The evaluation took place in two drop-in centers for homeless young adults in the Los Angeles area. Homeless young adults ages 18-25 (mean age = 21.8) received the AWARE program (n = 100) or usual care (n = 100). The sample was 73% male, 79% heterosexual, and 31%non-Hispanic white. Surveys were completed at baseline and 3 months after program completion. The 3-months follow-up rate for the sample was 91%. Result(s): Satisfaction with the program was high and nearly half (48%) of AWARE participants completed all four sessions. At follow-up, AWARE participants reported a lower frequency of alcohol use over the past 3 months (p = 0.01), were less likely to be classified as a frequent heavy drinker (compared to a non-drinker) in the past 30 days (p = 0.05), and showed a marginally significant positive difference in their confidence that they could reduce/quit their drinking (p = 0.09), compared to control participants. In addition, AWARE participants showed significant increases in both their readiness (p = 0.02) and confidence (p = 0.02) to change their drug use, compared to control participants. In terms of sex-related outcomes, AWARE participants reported greater condom use self-efficacy than the control group at follow-up (p = 0.05), but intervention effects were not found for number of partners or condomuse. Conclusion(s): Results from this pilot evaluation are promising, suggesting that a brief group-MI intervention can be effective in helping homeless young adults make positive changes in their alcohol use, as well as strengthen their motivation to reduce their drug use and their condom use self-efficacy.

N2  - This study was part of a randomized controlled trial designed to improve hepatitis knowledge and health promoting behaviors and subsequently decrease stimulant use and incarceration with 422 (G/B) homeless men between 18 and 46 years of age. Findings revealed that no significant program differences on incarceration in the 4 months following the intervention. However, younger participants (p = .010), and those with prior incarceration (p = .001) were at greater risk for incarceration at 4 months. An additional factor associated with incarceration at 4 months included living on the street for at least 1 week (p = .049).

N2  - BACKGROUND: While adolescents' access and utilization of health services is critical for ensuring their health, very few seek care, and if they do, it is primarily from family members, friends, or other non-formal sources of care. Examining the influence of the social context on adolescent health care seeking behaviors may provide us with a better understanding for how interventions can increase adolescents' utilization of formal health care services., METHODS: The study is based on qualitative and quantitative data collected as part of the Well Being of Adolescents in Vulnerable Environments (WAVE) study, one of the first global studies to focus on very disadvantaged urban adolescents (aged 15-19 years) across five diverse sites, which include: Baltimore (USA), Ibadan (Nigeria), Johannesburg (South Africa), New Delhi (India), and Shanghai (China). Qualitative data was based on numerous methodologies, including key informant interviews, a Photovoice exercise, community mapping, focus groups and in-depth interviews. Quantitative data was gathered from a cross-sectional Audio Computer Assisted Self Interview (ACASI) survey that was administered to approximately 450-500 adolescents per site, yielding a total of 2,393 adolescents. Respondent-driven sampling was used to ensure the sample include out-of-school youth and unstably housed youth who are often underrepresented in school-based or household-based samples., RESULTS: While adolescents in Baltimore, New Delhi, and Johannesburg were more likely to seek health services if they felt illness symptoms, a fairly large proportion of adolescents indicated that even when they needed health care, they didn't seek it. In Johannesburg, more than 30 % of adolescents did not seek care even when they knew it was needed. Similarly, nearly a quarter of adolescents in Baltimore and in Shanghai indicated not seeking care when needed. Qualitative data indicated that adolescents exhibited a general lack of trust in providers and often felt embarrassed or stigmatized for seeking services. Multivariate analysis revealed that perceived fear and exposure to community violence was associated with a decreased likelihood of seeking care, while adult support from the home increased adolescents' likelihood to seek care in Baltimore and Johannesburg., CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent health care seeking patterns vary substantially by setting and gender. Neighborhood and family environments are important contexts in which health seeking behaviors are shaped. Efforts to connect adolescents to health care will need to target neighborhood safety as well as trust and support among adults outside of provider settings.

N2  - Evidence documenting effects of food assistance programs, household food insecurity, and nutrition knowledge on health outcomes is building. Using data from a sub-sample of adults who are 185% of the poverty line from the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 2,171), we examine whether household food insecurity, food stamp take-up, and use of informal food supports are associated with health risk among low-income households. Findings indicate that while nutrition knowledge provides protection against health risk in food secure households, the health benefits of nutrition knowledge were not evident in food insecure households. We discuss these findings in light of current policy and practice interventions that recognize the importance of providing healthy, affordable food options for food insecure households.

N2  - AIMS: To follow-up hospitalization for physical diseases among homeless men and women compared with a control group from the general population. The study also investigated the changes in the difference between the homeless men and women and the general population over time by comparing two cohorts of homeless people (2000-2002 and 1996)., METHODS: A total of 3887 people (24% women) who were homeless during the period 2000-2002 were compared with 11,661 people from the general population with respect to hospitalization for physical diseases and injuries (2000-2010). Indirect comparisons were used to compare the relative risk (RR) of hospitalization between the cohort of people who were homeless in 2000-2002 with a cohort of those who were homeless in 1996., RESULTS: Homeless people have an RR of being hospitalized for physical diseases twice that of the general population. The largest differences were found in skin diseases, infections, injury/poisoning and diseases of the respiratory system. Indirect comparison between people who were homeless in 2000-2002 and 1996 showed an increasing difference between young (18-35 years) homeless men and men in the control group (RR 1.32). The difference had also increased between homeless men and men in the control group for hospitalization for heart disease (RR 1.35), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR 2.60) and poisoning (RR 1.89). Among women, the difference had decreased between homeless women and women in the control group for skin disease (RR 0.20) and injury/poisoning (RR 0.60). There was no significant difference between the sexes in the two homeless cohorts., CONCLUSIONS: There was no improvement in excess hospitalization among homeless people over time. The difference between young homeless men and young men in the general population increased between 1996 and 2000-2002.

N2  - Background: People seeking treatment for substance use disorders often have additional health and social issues. Although individuals presenting with alcohol as the primary drug of concern (PDOC) account for nearly half of all treatment episodes to the Australian alcohol and other drug (AOD) service system, previous treatment cohort studies have focused only on the profile of Australian heroin or methamphetamine users. While studies overseas indicate that clients seeking treatment primarily for their drinking are less likely to experience social and economic marginalisation than those seeking treatment primarily for illicit or pharmaceutical drug use, very little research has directly compared individuals presenting with alcohol as the PDOC to those primarily presenting with other drugs as their PDOC. Method(s): Seven hundred and ninety-six participants were recruited at entry to specialist AOD treatment in Victoria and Western Australia, and completed measures of demographic and social factors, substance use, quality of life, service use, and criminal justice involvement. We compared those with alcohol as their PDOC to those with other drugs as their PDOC using Pearson chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests. Result(s): Rates of social disadvantage, poor quality of life, high severity of substance dependence, and past-year AOD, mental health, acute health, and social service use were high in all groups. However, participants with alcohol as the PDOC were older; more likely to have an educational qualification; less likely to report criminal justice involvement, housing/homelessness service use, tobacco smoking, or problems with multiple substances; and reported better environmental quality of life; but were more likely to have used ambulance services, than those with other drugs as their PDOC. Conclusion(s): While those seeking treatment primarily for alcohol problems appear less likely to suffer some forms of social and economic disadvantage or to use multiple substances than those with a primary drug problem, they experience similarly high levels of substance dependence severity and mental health and AOD service use. These findings reinforce the need for AOD services to integrate or coordinate care with programs that address the many complexities clients frequently present with, while also acknowledging differences between those seeking treatment for alcohol versus other drug problems.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).

N2  - Facial mimicry and vagal regulation represent two crucial physiological responses to others' facial expressions of emotions. Facial mimicry, defined as the automatic, rapid and congruent electromyographic activation to others' facial expressions, is implicated in empathy, emotional reciprocity and emotions recognition. Vagal regulation, quantified by the computation of Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA), exemplifies the autonomic adaptation to contingent social cues. Although it has been demonstrated that childhood maltreatment induces alterations in the processing of the facial expression of emotions, both at an explicit and implicit level, the effects of maltreatment on children's facial mimicry and vagal regulation in response to facial expressions of emotions remain unknown. The purpose of the present study was to fill this gap, involving 24 street-children (maltreated group) and 20 age-matched controls (control group). We recorded their spontaneous facial electromyographic activations of corrugator and zygomaticus muscles and RSA responses during the visualization of the facial expressions of anger, fear, joy and sadness. Results demonstrated a different impact of childhood maltreatment on facial mimicry and vagal regulation. Maltreated children did not show the typical positive-negative modulation of corrugator mimicry. Furthermore, when only negative facial expressions were considered, maltreated children demonstrated lower corrugator mimicry than controls. With respect to vagal regulation, whereas maltreated children manifested the expected and functional inverse correlation between RSA value at rest and RSA response to angry facial expressions, controls did not. These results describe an early and divergent functional adaptation to hostile environment of the two investigated physiological mechanisms. On the one side, maltreatment leads to the suppression of the spontaneous facial mimicry normally concurring to empathic understanding of others' emotions. On the other side, maltreatment forces the precocious development of the functional synchronization between vagal regulation and threatening social cues facilitating the recruitment of fight-or-flight defensive behavioral strategies.Copyright © 2016 Ardizzi et al.

N2  - Background and purpose: The rising rate of Iranian runaway girls indicates a need for conducting deep studies on this issue. This study aimed at investigating the phenomenon of running away from home by studying the lived experience of the girls in a juvenile correction and rehabilitation center in Tehran, Iran. Material(s) and Method(s): A qualitative phenomenological study was performed in which 12 female in correction and rehabilitation center were selected using purposive sampling. The lived experiences of the participants were studied by semi-structured interview. Then, the transcripts were analyzed applying interpretative phenomenology and Van Manen approach. Afterwards, the main themes, subthemes and semantic units were created. Result(s): The thematic analysis resulted in three subthemes for turmoil in the family including disturbed family, lack of parental support and affection, and family's antisocial behaviors. All subthemes included some semantic units. Conclusion(s): According to this study, deep attention is needed on lived experiences of runaway girls, psychotherapy sessions based on the main themes achieved in this research, and family therapy sessions based on improving the conflicts, especially in presence of key family members. Such actions in correction and rehabilitation centers helps the psychologists to rebuild the life of affected individuals after coming back home and prevent future problems.Copyright © 2016, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

N2  - UNLABELLED: Elevated prevalence estimates of sexually transmitted infections and sexual risk behaviors have commonly been reported among homeless and precariously housed adults. Research has increasingly recognized the importance and impact of structural factors, such as housing, on risk behaviors. Several researchers have argued that supported housing interventions, such as Housing First (HF), may contribute to reductions in sexual risk behavior. The present study is the first analysis of a randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of HF on unprotected sex among formerly homeless and marginally housed adults with mental illness and complex comorbidities., METHODS: Generalized estimating equations were used to examine between-group differences in unprotected sex., RESULTS: Compared with treatment as usual, no association was found between HF and unprotected sex over the 24 months of follow-up. Several other variables were significantly and independently associated with unprotected sex., CONCLUSION: Results suggest that further interventions are needed to reduce unprotected sex among homeless and unstably housed individuals with mental illness.

N2  - Outreach and service linkage are key for engaging marginalized populations, such as homeless youth, in services. Research to date has focused primarily on engaging individuals already receiving some services through emergency shelters, clinics, or other programs. Less is known about those who are not connected to services and, thus, likely the most vulnerable and in need of assistance. The current study sought to engage non-service-connected homeless youth (N=79) into a strengths-based outreach and advocacy intervention. Youth were randomly assigned to receive 6 months of advocacy that focused on linking youth to a drop-in center (n=40) or to a crisis shelter (n=39). All youth were assessed at baseline and 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Findings indicated that youth prefer drop-in center services to the shelter. Also, the drop-in center linkage condition was associated with more service linkage overall (B=0.34, SE=0.04, p<0.01) and better alcohol-l [B=-0.39, SE=0.09, t(75)=-4.48, p<0.001] and HIV-related outcomes [B=0.62, SE=0.10, t(78)=6.34, p<0.001] compared to the shelter linkage condition. Findings highlight the importance of outreach and service linkage for reconnecting service-marginalized youth, and drop-in centers as a primary service option for homeless youth.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Preventing injection drug use among vulnerable youth is critical for reducing serious drug-related harms. Addiction treatment is one evidence-based intervention to decrease problematic substance use; however, youth frequently report being unable to access treatment services and the impact of this on drug use trajectories remains largely unexplored. This study examines the relationship between being unable to access addiction treatment and injection initiation among street-involved youth., METHODS: Data were derived from the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), a prospective cohort of street-involved youth aged 14-26 who use illicit drugs, from September 2005 to May 2014. An extended Cox model with time-dependent variables was used to identify factors independently associated with injection initiation., RESULTS: Among 462 participants who were injection naive at baseline, 97 (21 %) initiated injection drug use over study follow-up and 129 (28 %) reported trying but being unable to access addiction treatment in the previous 6 months at some point during the study period. The most frequently reported reason for being unable to access treatment was being put on a wait list. In a multivariable Cox regression analysis, being unable to access addiction treatment remained independently associated with a more rapid rate of injection initiation (Adjusted Hazard Ratio =2.02; 95 % Confidence Interval: 1.12-3.62), after adjusting for potential confounders., CONCLUSION: Inability to access addiction treatment was common among our sample and associated with injection initiation. Findings highlight the need for easily accessible, evidence-based addiction treatment for high-risk youth as a means to prevent injection initiation and subsequent serious drug-related harms.

N2  - Eligible adolescents (12-17 years old) were recruited from a short-term crisis shelter for runaway adolescents in a large Midwestern city. Adolescents (N = 179) were randomly assigned to Ecologically-Based Family Therapy (EBFT, n = 61), the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA, n = 57), or brief Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET, n = 61) with the primary focus on substance abuse. A significant increase in perceived family cohesion and a significant reduction in perceived family conflict were found among all treatment conditions from baseline to the 24-month follow-up. Adolescents who received EBFT demonstrated more improvement in family cohesion after treatment than those who received CRA or MET, and more reduction in family conflict during treatment than those who received MET.

N2  - BACKGROUND: High attrition among research participants undermines the validity and generalizability of field research. This study contrasted two incentivizing methods--money orders (MOs) or rechargeable incentive cards (RICs)--with regard to rates of participants' study engagement and follow-up contact over a 6-month period., METHODS: Substance abusers (N = 303) in Los Angeles, California were recruited and randomized to either an MO (control) or RIC (experimental) condition. All participants were asked to call the researchers at the beginning of each calendar month for the ensuing 5 months to update their locator information, even if nothing had changed. Each call resulted in a $10 payment, issued immediately via the RIC system or by MO by mail. Research staff located and interviewed all participants at Month 6. Contact logs assessed level of effort required to locate participants and conduct follow-up interviews., RESULTS: Relative to controls, RIC participants, especially those with low ability to defer gratification, initiated more monthly calls. Six-month follow-up rates did not differ between RIC (75%) and controls (79%), though the RIC condition was associated with an average staff time savings of 39.8 minutes per study participant., DISCUSSION: For longitudinal public health research involving itinerant study participants, the RIC method produces a modest benefit in study engagement and reduced staff time devoted to participant tracking and payments. However, the overall cost-effectiveness of this approach will depend on the pricing model of the card-issuing vendor (which in turns depends on the scale of the project, with per-unit costs falling for larger projects).

N2  - This study reports the mental health outcomes of a small randomized clinical trial (n = 60) that compared housing and supportive services (Ecologically-Based Treatment, EBT) to community based housing and support services (treatment as usual, TAU). Mothers receiving EBT, but not those receiving TAU, reported reductions in their children's behavioral health problems. Reductions in mothers' mental health problems and intimate partner violence were observed in both TAU and EBT. The current findings provide evidence supporting the efficacy of independent housing and integrated support services. Given that EBT showed similar, and in some cases superior findings to TAU, EBT may be an effective alternative for communities that do not have shelters available for those families experiencing homelessness.

N2  - While research on homeless adolescents and young adults evidencing substance use disorder is increasing, there is a dearth of information regarding effective interventions, and more research is needed to guide those who serve this population. The current study builds upon prior research showing promising findings of the community reinforcement approach (CRA) (Slesnick, Prestopnik, Meyers, & Glassman, 2007). Homeless adolescents and young adults between the ages of 14 to 20. years were randomized to one of three theoretically distinct interventions: (1) CRA (. n=. 93), (2) motivational enhancement therapy (MET, n=. 86), or (3) case management (CM, n=. 91). The relative effectiveness of these interventions was evaluated at 3, 6, and 12. months post-baseline. Findings indicated that substance use and associated problems were significantly reduced in all three interventions across time. Several moderating effects were found, especially for sex and history of childhood abuse. Findings show little evidence of superiority or inferiority of the three interventions and suggest that drop-in centers have choices for addressing the range of problems that these adolescents and young adults face.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Little attention has been given to how the environment of homeless shelters may impact the mental health of their residents. This study addresses this gap in the literature and presents a cross-sectional analysis of 209 caregivers nested within 10 family shelters across New York City. Multivariate regression was employed using hierarchical modeling to test the association between two shelter related variables (ie, the perceived social environment of the shelter and difficulty following shelter rules) and the mental health status of the caregiver residents. Less favorable perceptions of the social environment of the shelter and difficulty following shelter rules were both found to be associated with poorer mental health after controlling for demographic covariates as well as time in the shelter and first time in the shelter. These findings highlight the potential impact of the perceived social environment of shelters and methods of governance of shelters on the mental health of caregiver residents. In addition, the findings support the notion that interventions such as trauma informed care could potentially aid in addressing the mental health challenges that residents face.Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - The importance of certain neurotrophic proteins found in maternal blood and milk for breastfed infants has remained ambiguous. This study was conducted to present evidence of the impact of an induced deficit of active S100B protein on neonate development. Newborn mice from two groups of mothers, immunized or sham-immunized against S100B, were subjected to various behavioral tests, and the development of their morphological characteristics was recorded from birth until weaning. Morphological problems, including weight gain and fur coating, a delay in the maturation of neurobehavioral systems and a deficit in neuromotor functions, including visual abilities, somato-sensory and posture reactions, muscular strength, locomotion, and fear/orienting processes, were observed in pups of immunized mothers. The S100B protein of external or internal origin in infants may be considered to be a specific factor that determines neuro- and morphological development and a risk-avoidance ('homeward-bent' or fearful) phenotype. The suppression of activity of the S100B protein results in a slower neonatal development and the formation of a risk-tolerant (fearless) phenotype of the offspring. This study thus considers the mechanism of neuroplastic regulation on the extent of sensation-seeking or risk-taking (homeless-like or fearless) and sensation- or risk-avoidance (home-bound or fearful) features in individual phenotypes.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study examines key themes from narrative interviews conducted with 43 homeless adults with mental disorders 18 months after random assignment to Housing First with intensive supports or to treatment as usual (no housing or supports through the study)., METHOD: Coding and thematic analysis of semistructured interviews was based on 2 research questions from participants' perspectives: (a) What changes were perceived over time? (b) What factors facilitated or hindered change?, RESULTS: The majority of participants assigned to Housing First reported positive change across multiple domains as a result of stable housing; whereas the majority of treatment as usual participants reported negative or neutral change. Key themes included feelings of security and pride; adjusting to living alone; housing as a learning process; and developing meaningful activity. The sense of security associated with stable housing was the most influential factor that supported change. Factors that helped or hindered change clustered into 4 key themes: the type and quality of services; the cumulative effects of trauma; social ties; and concurrent substance use., CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our findings provide important context to the emerging body of quantitative research on Housing First and recovery from homelessness. Participants' experiences of recovery, particularly as it relates to housing and supports, shifts in identity, and meaningful activity must be acknowledged and incorporated into the design and evaluation of public services, and policy and service reforms.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Background: To determine the relationship between household food insecurity (HHFI) and symptoms of respiratory infections among infants in rural Ghana. Method(s): The study was cross-sectional. The outcome variables were symptoms of respiratory infections (cough and nasal discharge) in infants. HHFI was measured using a 15-item modified U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) household food security module. Households were classified as food insecure if they had an affirmative answer for at least 1 item. Associations were examined using multiple logistic regression analysis. Data were collected in 32 communities located in 3 rural subdistricts in the Upper Manya Krobo district of the Eastern region of Ghana. The sample included 367 infants aged 6-11 months who attended a community-based growth monitoring session. Result(s): Overall, 20.5% of households reported experiencing food insecurity in the last month. Compared with infants in food secure households, infants living in food insecure households were about twice as likely to experience cough (adjusted odds ratio: 2.25, 95% confidence intervals: 1.25, 4.04) and nasal discharge (adjusted odds ratio: 1.87, 95% confidence intervals: 1.05, 3.36). Conclusion(s): Infants living in food insecure households are at an increased risk of respiratory tract morbidity. Interventions that address HHFI might be important to improve infant health in rural Ghana.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

T1  - History of foster care among homeless adults with mental illness in Vancouver, British Columbia: A precursor to trajectories of risk
A1  - Patterson M.L.

A1  - Somers J.M. 
Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Background: It is well documented that a disproportionate number of homeless adults have childhood histories of foster care placement(s). This study examines the relationship between foster care placement as a predictor of adult substance use disorders (including frequency, severity and type), mental illness, vocational functioning, service use and duration of homelessness among a sample of homeless adults with mental illness. We hypothesize that a history of foster care predicts earlier, more severe and more frequent substance use, multiple mental disorder diagnoses, discontinuous work history, and longer durations of homelessness. Method(s): This study was conducted using baseline data from two randomized controlled trials in Vancouver, British Columbia for participants who responded to a series of questions pertaining to out-of-home care at 12 months follow-up (n = 442). Primary outcomes included current mental disorders; substance use including type, frequency and severity; physical health; duration of homelessness; vocational functioning; and service use. Result(s): In multivariable regression models, a history of foster care placement independently predicted incomplete high school, duration of homelessness, discontinuous work history, less severe types of mental illness, multiple mental disorders, early initiation of drug and/or alcohol use, and daily drug use. Conclusion(s): This is the first Canadian study to investigate the relationship between a history of foster care and current substance use among homeless adults with mental illness, controlling for several other potential confounding factors. It is important to screen homeless youth who exit foster care for substance use, and to provide integrated treatment for concurrent disorders to homeless youth and adults who have both psychiatric and substance use problems. Trials registration numbers: Both trials are registered with the International Standard Randomized Control Trial Number Register and were assigned ISRCTN57595077(Vancouver At Home Study: Housing First plus assertive community treatment versus congregate housing plus supports versus treatment as usual) and ISRCTN66721740(Vancouver At Home Study: Housing First plus intensive case management versus treatment as usual) on September 9, 2012.Copyright © 2015 Patterson et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a clinic-based screening and referral system (Well Child Care, Evaluation, Community Resources, Advocacy, Referral, Education [WE CARE]) on families' receipt of community-based resources for unmet basic needs. METHOD(S): We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial at 8 urban community health centers, recruiting mothers of healthy infants. In the 4 WE CARE clinics, mothers completed a self-report screening instrument that assessed needs for child care, education, employment, food security, household heat, and housing. Providers made referrals for families; staff provided requisite applications and telephoned referred mothers within 1 month. Families at the 4 control community health centers received the usual care. We analyzed the results with generalized mixed-effect models. RESULT(S): Three hundred thirty-six mothers were enrolled in the study (168 per arm). The majority of families had household incomes <$ 20 000 (57%), and 68% had >=2 unmet basic needs. More WE CARE mothers received >=1 referral at the index visit (70% vs 8%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 29.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 14.7-59.6). At the 12-month visit, more WE CARE mothers had enrolled in a new community resource (39% vs 24%; aOR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.7). WE CARE mothers had greater odds of being employed (aOR = 44.4; 95% CI, 9.8-201.4). WE CARE children had greater odds of being in child care (aOR = 6.3; 95% CI, 1.5-26.0). WE CARE families had greater odds of receiving fuel assistance (aOR = 11.9; 95% CI, 1.7-82.9) and lower odds of being in a homeless shelter (aOR = 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9). CONCLUSION(S): Systematically screening and referring for social determinants during well child care can lead to the receipt of more community resources for families.Copyright © 2015 by the American Academy of Pediatrics

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - This study examined gender differences among homeless young adults' coping strategies and homelessness stressors as they relate to legal (e.g., full-time employment, selling personal possessions, selling blood/plasma) and illegal economic activity (e.g., selling drugs, theft, prostitution). A sample of 601 homeless young adults was recruited from 3 cities (Los Angeles, CA [. n=200], Austin, TX [. n=200], and Denver, CO [. n=201]) to participate in semi-structured interviews from March 2010 to July 2011. Risk and resilience correlates of legal and illegal economic activity were analyzed using six Ordinary Least Squares regression models with the full sample and with the female and male sub-samples. In the full sample, three variables (i.e., avoidant coping, problem-focused coping, and mania) were associated with legal income generation whereas eight variables (i.e., social coping, age, arrest history, transience, peer substance use, antisocial personality disorder [ASPD], substance use disorder [SUD], and major depressive episode [MDE]) were associated with illegal economic activity. In the female sub-sample, three variables (i.e., problem-focused coping, race/. ethnicity, and transience) were correlated with legal income generation whereas six variables (i.e., problem-focused coping, social coping, age, arrest history, peer substance use, and ASPD) were correlated with illegal economic activity. Among males, the model depicting legal income generation was not significant yet seven variables (i.e., social coping, age, transience, peer substance use, ASPD, SUD, and MDE) were associated with illegal economic activity. Understanding gender differences in coping strategies and economic activity might help customize interventions aimed at safe and legal income generation for this population.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - AIMS: The concept of subjective age (SA) refers to the age that one feels or looks relative to one's chronological age. A key variable that contributes to SA in North America is health, with poorer health associated with older SA. Only a few studies, however, have focused on individuals from vulnerable populations who frequently experience health challenges. The purpose of this study was to examine levels of SA and age satisfaction, as well as their correlations with health variables, in a sample of homeless or vulnerably housed (HVH) adults. METHOD(S): The sample consisted of 240 HVH adults (50.4 % male) aged 19-72 years (M = 42.4, SD = 11.79). Study participants completed measures with an interviewer. RESULT(S): Results showed that HVH adults, on average, felt and thought they looked slightly younger than their chronological ages. They felt slightly older physically, but mentally the same, as their chronological ages. While HVH adults reported wanting to be slightly younger than their actual ages, generally, they were slightly satisfied with being their age. Participants overall were "neither dissatisfied nor satisfied" with their current health, but reported their health had a slight negative impact on them. Notably, their SF-12 physical (M = 42.7, SD = 11.6) and mental (M = 39.5, SD = 12.1) health composite scores were below average relative to normative values of 50. The average EQ-5D health thermometer score was also low (M = 55 out of 100; SD = 21.2). HVH adults' overall and physically felt SA were significantly and negatively associated with all health variables (r = -.17 to -.48). Mentally felt SA and the age one looks showed low significant correlations with only a few health ratings. The age one wants to be ideally showed a low positive and significant correlation only with the SF-12 physical health composite score. Finally, age satisfaction showed low to moderate positive correlations with all health variables (r = .22 to .43) except the SF-12 physical health composite score (r = .03). CONCLUSION(S): HVH adults reported SAs close to their chronological ages. Despite generally low health scores, those who reported higher physically felt SA tended to have worse health and those who reported higher age satisfaction tended to report better health.

N2  - Original Research. Objective(s): To develop and augment communication skills in the creation of a peer community health worker (CHW) position for a youth services community-based outreach program. Background(s): The positive impact of CHWs has been demonstrated in adult populations in a variety of settings. At-risk youth populations, however, differ significantly, and one important area is trust. In a companion project, interview data identified a high level of healthcare provider distrust by youths compared to other populations. This may be a significant contributor to poor healthcare outcomes for these youths due to the effect on health-seeking behavior. This project was designed to incorporate peer CHWs that received services from the outreach program as a bridge for these youths to build trust, thereby reducing the use of avoidance as a healthcare-seeking behavior for this population. Previous research on the use of youth peer CHWs was not found. Method(s): Two peers receiving services community-based outreach program were hired on a part-time basis. Individual weekly mentoring sessions were scheduled with the clinical pharmacist to identify skills and knowledge areas each would like to improve. These included technology and specific healthcare topics of interest. A plan of action was developed with specific goals and timelines for each peer CHW. Result(s): Each peer CHW identified typing and using the internet as skills to be developed. Resources were identified and each worked independently to develop these skills. Skill development was reviewed during the weekly mentoring sessions. Each reported typing and using the internet improved plus more confidence with these skills. Healthcare topics important to homeless or street youth were areas of interest. Using their typing and internet skills, they identified resources and worked independently to develop information cards to facilitate talking with peers. Topics developed included diabetes and skin infections, lice, scabies and bedbugs, methamphetamine use, and bacterial and viral sexually transmitted infections. Topics targeted for development include drugs of abuse, specifically synthetic cannabinoids (spice, K2). Conclusion(s): The youth peer HCWs reported they were very satisfied with their progress, and the cards would help facilitate approaching their peers to provide information and help peers seek medical care.

N2  - Aims: Drug users are routinely excluded from research participation, but drug use is common and non-medical exclusions unnecessarily bias research results. A NIDA ambassador intervention to increase enrollment of drug users in relevant research and change the research enterprise gave us the opportunity to study differences in the lives of drug users and non-drug users that may be linked to advances in research and treatment access. Method(s): Data came from the Transformative Approach to Reduce Research Disparities Towards Drug Users study that randomized drug users and non-drug users to an ambassador (individual attention and transportation) or a standard navigator intervention (individualized study matching) to increase access to medical care and opportunities to participate in research. Final 60 day assessment of intervention effectiveness will conclude this month. For this analysis, we consider whether the lives of drug users and nonusers differ in ways that are more relevant and less discriminatory than drug use. Result(s): The sample is 285 community recruited adults, 18 to 80, who endorsed no drug use, and 280 who endorsed current drug use. Drug users were significantly more likely to consider themselves homeless (22% vs. 15%), be food insecure (43% vs. 35%), have unpredictable daily activities (51% vs. 39%), feel unsettled (40% vs. 31%), have more days of the month where they felt unable to control important things [8.25 (95% CI 6.91, 9.51) vs. 5.88 (4.74, 7.03)] and have more overall life chaos [4.98 (95%CI 4.61, 5.34) vs. 3.97(95%CI 3.65, 4.3)]. Evictions, jail time, having a child removed, and social support, were not different by drug use. Conclusion(s): Biased attitudes towards drug users, especially given the legalization of marijuana in many states, are untenable. Understanding and measuring daily life challengesamongpotential participants is important to decrease prejudicial enrollment practices, and to improve the ability to fully participate in research and attend relevant services for those who use drugs.

N2  - Aims: The current study aimed to (1) identify classes of trajectories in the frequency of drug use during a 12-month period among homeless youth received one of three treatments, including the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA), Motivation Enhancement Therapy (MET), and Case Management (CM); and (2) examine whether treatment modalities, gender, ethnicity, and history of physical abuse would predict the class membership. Method(s): Participants (N= 270) were recruited from a local drop-in center. Eligible youth met the criteria of homelessness as defined by the McKinney-Vento Act and abuse or dependence for Psychoactive Substance Use or Alcohol Disorder as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-Youth were randomized to receive CRA (n = 93), MET (n = 86), or CM (n = 91). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 3, 6 and 12 months post baseline. Result(s): Growth mixture modeling analysis was conducted using MPlus 7 (Muthen and Muthen, 1998-2012). A three-class model fit the data the best. About half of the sample (n = 125) fell into the "fast decreasing" class, 67 youth fell into the "slow decreasing" class and 73 youth fell into the "increasing" class. Compared to those received CM, youth received CRA showed a lower likelihood of being in the "slow decreasing" class than in the "fast decreasing" class [b =-0.75, S.E. = 0.44, p = 0.085], and youth received MET showed a lower likelihood of being in the "increasing" class than in the "fast decreasing" class [b =-0.70, S.E. = 0.41, p = 0.086]. Being African American [b = 0.17, S.E. = 0.08, p < 0.05] or female [b = 0.64, S.E. = 0.34, p = 0.059] increased the likelihood of being in the "slow decreasing" class than being in the "fast decreasing" class. Conclusion(s): The current findings suggest that CRA and MET may be more effective than CM since homeless youth received CRA or MET were more likely to exhibit fast reductions in the frequency of drug use during a 12-month period.

N2  - Membership in important social groups can promote a positive identity. We propose and test an identity resource model in which personal self-esteem is boosted by membership in additional important social groups. Belonging to multiple important group memberships predicts personal self-esteem in children (Study 1a), older adults (Study 1b), and former residents of a homeless shelter (Study 1c). Study 2 shows that the effects of multiple important group memberships on personal self-esteem are not reducible to number of interpersonal ties. Studies 3a and 3b provide longitudinal evidence that multiple important group memberships predict personal self-esteem over time. Studies 4 and 5 show that collective self-esteem mediates this effect, suggesting that membership in multiple important groups boosts personal self-esteem because people take pride in, and derive meaning from, important group memberships. Discussion focuses on when and why important group memberships act as a social resource that fuels personal self-esteem.Copyright © 2015 Jetten et al.

T1  - The Family Unification Program: A Randomized-Controlled Trial of Housing Stability

N2  - The study tests the short-term impact on housing stability of the Family Unification Program (FUP), a permanent housing program for child welfare- involved families at risk of separation from children due to inadequate housing. Families eligible for FUP (n = 150) received housing case management services as usual, and half were referred for permanent housing vouchers made available through FUP. Families referred for FUP secured more enriched home learning environments, while more precariously housed families exhibited greater housing, stability when referred for FUP. The intervention did not relate with housing affordability or improvements in neighborhood quality. Findings suggest benefits of FUP-especially for more vulnerable families--in key areas that support child developmet; however, families continue to struggle in the context of poverty.

N2  - This article presents preliminary findings from an impact study that drew upon administrative data collected by city agencies and data collected by a supportive housing program for young adults who are aging out of foster care, homeless, or at risk of homelessness. Participation in the program was associated with a reduction in shelter use and jail stays during the two years after program entry. The study demonstrates the benefits of collaboration and the possibilities of using administrative data from multiple public agencies to evaluate program impacts on young adult outcomes.

N2  - The high prevalence of rape and sexual trauma symptomatology among women involved in street-based sex trades is well-established. Because prior research has lacked appropriate, non-sex trade involved comparison groups, it is unknown whether differences exist among similarly situated women who do and do not trade sex. This article explores experiences of childhood and adult rape and symptomatology of sexual abuse trauma among a community-based sample of 322 women who use methamphetamine in San Francisco, California, 61% of whom were involved in the sex trade. Study participants were recruited via respondent-driven sampling and eligible if they were cisgender women, aged 18 or older, current methamphetamine users, and sexually active with at least one cisgender man in the past 6 months. The dependent variable was sexual abuse trauma symptomatology, as measured by the Sexual Abuse Trauma Index (SATI) subscale of the Trauma Symptom Checklist-40 (TSC-40), and the explanatory variable was sex trade involvement. Potential covariates were age, current homelessness, methamphetamine dependence, and experiences of childhood and adult rape. Sixty-one percent of participants had a SATI subscale score suggestive of sexual abuse trauma. The overall prevalence of rape in childhood and adulthood was 52% and 73%, respectively. In bivariate analysis, sex trade involvement and all of the potential covariates except for homelessness and age were associated with a SATI score suggestive of sexual abuse trauma. In multivariate models controlling for significant covariates, there was no longer a statistically significant association between sex trade involvement or childhood rape and an elevated SATI score. Elevated levels of psychological dependence on methamphetamine and experiences of rape as an adult were still associated with a high SATI score. These findings highlight that urban poor women, regardless of sex trade involvement, suffer high levels of rape and related trauma symptomatology. Copyright © The Author(s) 2014.

N2  - We describe data from a multi-center community-based survey of homeless veterans who were not accessing available primary care to identify reasons for not getting this care as well as for not seeking health care when it was needed. Overall, 185 homeless veterans were interviewed: The average age was 48.7 years (SD 10.8), 94.6% were male, 43.2% were from a minority population. The majority identified a recent need for care and interest in having a primary care provider. Reasons for delaying care fell into three domains: 1) trust; 2) stigma; and 3) care processes. Identifying a place for care (OR 3.3; 95% CI: 1.4-7.7), having a medical condition (OR 5.5; 95% CI 1.9-15.4) and having depression (OR 3.4; 95% CI: 1.4-8.7) were associated with receiving care while not being involved in care decisions was associated with no care (OR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5-0.9). Our findings support the importance of considering health access within an expanded framework that includes perceived stigma, inflexible care systems and trust issues.

N2  - PURPOSE: In this study, we report prevalence rates of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and Axis I psychiatric and substance use disorders among randomly selected women who were experiencing episodes of homelessness in three US cities., METHODS: The sample consists of 156 women, 79 from Omaha, NE, 39 from Pittsburgh, PA, and 38 from Portland, OR. It included 140 women from shelters and 16 women from meal locations. Latent class analysis was used to evaluate BPD symptoms., RESULTS: A large majority of the women (84.6 %) met criteria for at least one lifetime psychiatric disorder, about three-fourths (73.1 %) met criteria for a psychiatric disorder in the past year, and 39.7 % met past month criteria for a psychiatric disorder. Approximately three-fourths of the sample (73.7 %) met lifetime criteria for at least two disorders, about half (53.9 %) met criteria for at least three lifetime disorders, and approximately one-third (39.1 %) met criteria for four or more disorders. Latent class analyses indicated that 16.7 % of the women could be categorized as low self-harm BPD and 19.9 % high self-harm BPD., CONCLUSIONS: In shelters and in treatment settings, these women will present with complex histories of multiple serious psychiatric disorders. They are highly likely to manifest symptoms of BPD, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse disorders in addition to other psychiatric symptoms which will add to clinical complications.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - The current study compared offender and offense characteristics of pretrial defendants found incompetent to stand trial (IST) against those described as general offenders by victims in the 2008 Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) survey and evaluated factors that differentiated IST defendants who allegedly used weapons from those who did not during the course of a violent offense. IST defendants were older and used "weapons" more frequently than those reported in the BJS survey; however, other characteristics, including use of firearms, did not differ. No demographic, clinical, or legal factors differentiated pretrial defendants who used weapons from those who did not. Overall, pretrial defendants were frequently diagnosed with a comorbid substance use disorder, and were homeless, unemployed, and had an extensive history of psychiatric hospitalizations and prior arrests at the time of their alleged offenses. Such results indicate that models for comprehensive discharge planning may have utility in addressing the unique needs of this subgroup of mentally disordered offenders. The findings also raise questions about the federal and state prohibition of gun rights to all IST defendants.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - A randomized trial compared effects of a Family Critical Time Intervention (FCTI) to usual care for children in 200 newly homeless families in which mothers had diagnosable mental illness or substance problems. Adapted from an evidence-based practice to prevent chronic homelessness for adults with mental illnesses, FCTI combines housing and structured, time-limited case management to connect families leaving shelter with community services. Families were followed at five time points over 24 months. Data on 311 children-99 ages 1.5-5 years, 113 ages 6-10 years, and 99 ages 11-16 years-included mother-, teacher-, and child-reports of mental health, school experiences, and psychosocial well-being. Analyses used hierarchical linear modeling to investigate intervention effects and changes in child functioning over time. Referral to FCTI reduced internalizing and externalizing problems in preschool-aged children and externalizing for adolescents 11-16. The intervention led to declines in self-reported school troubles for children 6-10 and 11-16. Both experimental and control children in all age groups showed reductions in symptoms over time. Although experimental results were scattered, they suggest that FCTI has the potential to improve mental health and school outcomes for children experiencing homelessness.

N2  - Case management, a widely practiced form of service brokerage, is associated with a variety of positive outcomes for homeless youth, but it may be difficult to implement, as youth face logistical barriers to attending in-person meetings. As part of a larger clinical trial, the current study investigates the feasibility of providing electronic case management (ECM) to homeless youth, using cell-phones, texts, email, and Facebook. Youth were given prepaid cell-phones and a case manager who provided four ECM sessions every 2-3 weeks over a 3-month period. Contact logs were used to record how many youth engaged in ECM, how many attempts were necessary to elicit engagement, and youths' preferred technology methods for engaging. Although engagement in the number of ECM sessions varied, the majority of youth (87.5%) engaged in at least one ECM session. Youth (41%) most commonly needed one contact before they engaged in an ECM session, and the majority responded by the third attempt. While youth most commonly answered calls directly, their chosen method of returning calls was texting. The majority of youth (80%) described ECM positively, reporting themes of convenience, connection, and accountability. The use of ECM, particularly of texting, offers promising implications for providing services to homeless youth. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - This article reports 2-year outcomes from a cluster randomized, controlled trial of the Early Risers (ER) program implemented as a selective preventive intervention in supportive housing settings for homeless families. Based on the goals of this comprehensive prevention program, we predicted that intervention participants receiving ER services would show improvement in parenting and child outcomes relative to families in treatment-as-usual sites. The sample included 270 children in 161 families, residing in 15 supportive housing sites; multimethod, multi-informant assessments conducted at baseline and yearly thereafter included parent and teacher report of child adjustment, parent report of parenting self-efficacy, and parent-child observations that yielded scores of effective parenting practices. Data were modeled in HLM7 (4-level model accounting for nesting of children within families and families within housing sites). Two years' postbaseline, intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses indicated that parents in the ER group showed significantly improved parenting self-efficacy, and parent report indicated significant reductions in ER group children's depression. No main effects of ITT were shown for observed parenting effectiveness. However, over time, average levels of parenting self-efficacy predicted observed effective parenting practices, and observed effective parenting practices predicted improvements in both teacher- and parent-report of child adjustment. This is the first study to our knowledge to demonstrate prevention effects of a program for homeless families residing in family supportive housing.Copyright (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death among homeless people. This study examines CVD risk factors and 30-year CVD risk in a population of homeless individuals with mental illness., METHODS: CVD risks factors were assessed in 352 homeless individuals with mental illness in Toronto, Canada, at the time of their enrollment in the At Home/Chez Soi Project, a randomized trial of a Housing First intervention. The 30-year risk for CVD (coronary death, myocardial infarction, and fatal or nonfatal stroke) was calculated using published formulas and examined for association with need for mental health services, diagnosis of psychotic disorder, sex, ethnicity, access to a family physician and diagnosis of substance dependence., RESULTS: The 30-year CVD risk for study participants was 24.5+/-18.4%, more than double the reference normal of 10.1+/-7.21% (difference=-13.0% 95% CI -16.5% to -9.48%). Univariate analyses revealed 30-year CVD risk was greater among males (OR 3.99, 95% CI 2.47 to 6.56) and those who were diagnosed with substance dependence at baseline (OR 1.94 95% CI 1.23 to 3.06) and reduced among those who were non-white (OR 0.62 95% CI 0.39 to 0.97). In adjusted analyses, only male sex (OR 4.71 95% CI 2.76 to 8.05) and diagnosis of substance dependence (OR 1.78 95% CI 1.05 to 3.00) remained associated with increased CVD risk., CONCLUSIONS: Homeless people with mental illness have highly elevated 30-year CVD risk, particularly among males and those diagnosed with substance dependence. This study adds to the literature by reporting on CVD risk in a particularly vulnerable population of homeless individuals experiencing mental illness, and by using a 30-year CVD risk calculator which provides a longer time-frame during which the effect of modifiable CVD risk factors could be mitigated., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN42520374.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the prevalence of Multiple Comorbid Chronic Disease (MCCD) within homeless and non-homeless Veterans and the association between MCCD and inpatient medical care., METHODS: All individuals seen in the VA North Texas Health Care System between October 1, 2009 and September 30, 2010 (n = 102,034) were evaluated. Homelessness during the year and the number of common chronic diseases were evaluated for an association with likelihood of medical and psychiatric hospitalizations, bed days of care, inpatient substance treatment, rehabilitation admissions, and emergency department visits., RESULTS: Homeless Veterans had higher all-cause mortality rates and rates of use of almost all resources after controlling for chronic disease burden using the Charlson Comorbidity Index, psychiatric illnesses, substance use disorders, and demographic variables., CONCLUSIONS: Homelessness Veterans are vulnerable to a high use of resources and mortality, independent of medical and psychiatric conditions. This finding should focus additional attention on reducing homelessness.Copyright Published by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The housing first (HF) model for individuals experiencing homelessness and mental illness differs by design from traditional models that require consumers to achieve "housing readiness" by meeting program or treatment prerequisites in transitional housing settings prior to permanent housing placement. Given a growing body of evidence for its favorable outcomes and cost effectiveness, HF is increasingly seen as an alternative to and argument against these traditional programs. As such, it is important that the elements and implementation challenges of the HF model be clearly understood and articulated. This qualitative study explored a largely unexamined aspect of the HF model-the need for and meaning of temporary residential settings (interim housing), a place to stay while waiting to secure permanent housing-using interviews and focus groups with service providers and consumers who experienced interim housing during implementation of HF in a large urban center. Although interim housing may not be necessary for all programs implementing the model, our study revealed numerous reasons and demands for safe, flexible interim housing options, and illustrated how they influence the effectiveness of consumer recovery, continuous service engagement, and housing stability.

N2  - Purpose Social capital is essential for the successful development of young people. The current study examines direct measures of social capital in young people in five urban global contexts., Methods The Well-Being of Adolescents in Vulnerable Environments is a global study of young people aged 15-19 years living in disadvantaged, urban settings. Respondent-driven sampling was used to recruit approximately 500 participants from each site. The sample included 2,339 young people (mean age 16.7 years; 47.5% female). We examined the associations between social capital in four domains - family, school, peers, and neighborhood and demographic characteristics - using gender-stratified ordinary least-squares regression. We also examined associations between self-reported health and the four social capital domains, which was minimal., Results School enrollment was positively associated with social capital for young women in Baltimore, Delhi, and Shanghai; the association was less consistent for young men. The same pattern is true for perceived wealth. Unstable housing was associated with low familial social capital in all groups except young women in Shanghai and young men in Ibadan and Johannesburg. Being raised outside a two-parent family has a widespread, negative association with social capital. Self-reported health had a mainly positive association with social capital with the most consistent association being neighborhood social capital., Conclusions Different types of social capital interact with social contexts and gender differently. Strategies that aim to build social capital as part of risk reduction and positive youth development programming need to recognize that social capital enhancement may work differently for different groups and in different settings.Copyright © 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

N2  - The global adolescent population is larger than ever before and is rapidly urbanizing. Global surveillance systems to monitor youth health typically use household- and school-based recruitment methods. These systems risk not reaching the most marginalized youth made vulnerable by conditions of migration, civil conflict, and other forms of individual and structural vulnerability. We describe the methodology of the Well-Being of Adolescents in Vulnerable Environments survey, which used respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to recruit male and female youth aged 15-19 years and living in economically distressed urban settings in Baltimore, MD; Johannesburg, South Africa; Ibadan, Nigeria; New Delhi, India; and Shanghai, China (migrant youth only) for a cross-sectional study. We describe a shared recruitment and survey administration protocol across the five sites, present recruitment parameters, and illustrate challenges and necessary adaptations for use of RDS with youth in disadvantaged urban settings. We describe the reach of RDS into populations of youth who may be missed by traditional household- and school-based sampling. Across all sites, an estimated 9.6% were unstably housed; among those enrolled in school, absenteeism was pervasive with 29% having missed over 6 days of school in the past month. Overall findings confirm the feasibility, efficiency, and utility of RDS in quickly reaching diverse samples of youth, including those both in and out of school and those unstably housed, and provide direction for optimizing RDS methods with this population. In our rapidly urbanizing global landscape with an unprecedented youth population, RDS may serve as a valuable tool in complementing existing household- and school-based methods for health-related surveillance that can guide policy.Copyright © 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

N2  - Objectives: To identify barriers that are common and unique to six selected vulnerable groups: low socioeconomic status; Indigenous; mental illness and substance abuse; homeless; prisoners; and at-risk youth. Design(s): A systematic review was carried out to identify the perceived barriers to smoking cessation within six vulnerable groups. Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycInfo were searched using keywords and MeSH terms from each database's inception published prior to March 2014. Study selection: Studies that provided either qualitative or quantitative (ie, longitudinal, crosssectional or cohort surveys) descriptions of selfreported perceived barriers to quitting smoking in one of the six aforementioned vulnerable groups were included. Data extraction: Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. Result(s): 65 eligible papers were identified: 24 with low socioeconomic groups, 16 with Indigenous groups, 18 involving people with a mental illness, 3 with homeless groups, 2 involving prisoners and 1 involving at-risk youth. One study identified was carried out with participants who were homeless and addicted to alcohol and/or other drugs. Barriers common to all vulnerable groups included: smoking for stress management, lack of support from health and other service providers, and the high prevalence and acceptability of smoking in vulnerable communities. Unique barriers were identified for people with a mental illness (eg, maintenance of mental health), Indigenous groups (eg, cultural and historical norms), prisoners (eg, living conditions), people who are homeless (eg, competing priorities) and at-risk youth (eg, high accessibility of tobacco). Conclusion(s): Vulnerable groups experience common barriers to smoking cessation, in addition to barriers that are unique to specific vulnerable groups. Individual-level, community-level and social networklevel interventions are priority areas for future smoking cessation interventions within vulnerable groups

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is increasing recognition of the cognitive consequences of socioeconomic adversity during childhood, which can impair learning and negatively affect social and emotional development. However, there is a paucity of research on cognitive functioning and mental health among transition-age homeless youth. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap by examining the prevalence and functional significance of cognitive impairment and mental health disorders in a sample of 18- to 22-year-old homeless youth. METHOD(S): Participants (N = 73) were recruited from a vocational support program at Covenant House New York, a care agency for homeless youth. Assessments included diagnostic assessment for mental health disorders and evaluation of neurocognition and vocational outcomes. RESULT(S): Youth demonstrated histories of academic instability, academic achievement below expectation, and high rates of untreated psychiatric disorders, the most prominent of which were anxiety, substance use, and mood disorders. Of those who had a mental health diagnosis, more than half demonstrated cognitive deficits. Performance on measures of working memory and verbal memory was <70% of that of the age-matched normative population. Cognitive impairment was associated with a significant risk for making a wage insufficient for independent living. CONCLUSION(S): These data confirm the need to focus on cognitive as well as emotional and physical health in transition-age youth. Comprehensive intervention at this later developmental stage has the potential to facilitate the acquisition of skills needed for academic, vocational, and independent living success in adulthood.

N2  - Objectives: Little is known about influences of sample selection on estimation in propensity score matching. The purpose of the study was to assess potential selection bias using one-to-one greedy matching versus optimal full matching as part of an evaluation of supportive housing in New York City (NYC). Study Design and Settings: Data came from administrative data for 2 groups of applicants who were eligible for an NYC supportive housing program in 2007-09, including chronically homeless adults with a substance use disorder and young adults aging out of foster care. We evaluated the 2 matching methods in their ability to balance covariates and represent the original population, and in how those methods affected outcomes related to Medicaid expenditures. Result(s): In the population with a substance use disorder, only optimal full matching performed well in balancing covariates, whereas both methods created representative populations. In the young adult population, both methods balanced covariates effectively, but only optimal full matching created representative populations. In the young adult population, the impact of the program on Medicaid expenditures was attenuated when one-to-one greedy matching was used, compared with optimal full matching. Conclusion(s): Given covariate balancing with both methods, attenuated program impacts in the young adult population indicated that one-to-one greedy matching introduced selection bias.Copyright © 2014 Lim et al.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Objectives: This systematic review appraises published studies reporting associations between homelessness, perpetration of physically violent behavior and experience of victimization due to others' physically violent behavior, among young people. Method(s): A comprehensive systematic search of psychology, sociology, and health electronic databases, including PsycInfo and SocIndex was conducted. Search terms examined (a) homeless youth, (b) perpetration of physically violent behavior, and (c) experience of victimization due to others' physically violent behavior. Result(s): Twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Findings showed homeless youth report engaging in physically violent behavior including assault, physical fights, and robbery, and commonly describe victimization experiences such as being physically assaulted, threatened with weapons, and robbed. Rates of perpetration of physically violent behavior and experiences of victimization were inconsistent across reviewed studies. It is unclear whether homelessness is a predictor of the perpetration of physically violent behavior and/or victimization. Findings suggest that perpetration of, and being victimized by others' physically violent behavior, may vary for sub-groups of homeless youth. Conclusion(s): Further research embedded within theoretical perspectives that consider the influence of situational antecedents is warranted to examine whether homelessness is predictive of engagement in physically violent behavior and the experience of victimization due to others' physically violent behavior. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Examining age of onset of health risk behaviors as a mediator in the relationship between child maltreatment and psychosocial outcomes in middle adulthood

N2  - Background: Prior research has documented the wide-ranging and severe effects of child abuse and neglect across the lifespan. In particular, maltreatment has been linked to a number of health risk behaviors that are associated with long-lasting maladaptive psychosocial outcomes. However, it is not yet known whether the age of onset of these health risk behaviors acts as a conduit for later maladjustment for victims of abuse or neglect or increases risk. To fill this gap in knowledge, this study examines the mediating role of age of onset of five health risk behaviors - sexual intercourse, alcohol use, drug use, homelessness, and criminal behavior - in the relationship between abuse/neglect and psychosocial outcomes in middle adulthood. Method(s): This prospective, longitudinal study utilized a cohort design, in which abused/neglected children were matched with controls (N = 1196; 51.7% female; 66.2% White; 32.6% Black). Cases of abuse/neglect were drawn from the records of county juvenile and adult criminal courts in a metropolitan area in the Midwest during the years 1967 through 1971. The control group was matched as closely as possible on the basis of sex, age, race, and approximate family socioeconomic status. Self-reported ages of onset of sexual intercourse, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and homelessness, as well as official records of age of first arrest, were included as mediators. Psychosocial outcomes included self-reports of employment status, welfare receipt, internalizing symptoms (anxiety, depression, and PTSD), and substance use problems, as well as official records of criminal arrests through middle adulthood. Analyses included structural equation modeling to examine the direct and indirect effects of abuse/neglect on psychosocial outcomes in middle adulthood. Result(s): Age of initiation of sexual intercourse and age of first arrest mediated the relationship between child abuse/neglect and three of the outcomes- internalizing symptoms, problematic substance use, and number of arrests by middle adulthood. Sex differences revealed that age of initiation of sexual intercourse mediated these relationships for females only, whereas age of first arrest mediated these relationships for males only. Age of initiation of alcohol, illicit drug use, and homelessness did not mediate the relationship between child abuse/neglect and psychosocial outcomes in middle adulthood. Conclusion(s): These findings may be useful in determining where to focus intervention efforts for abused and/or neglected youths in order to ensure that intervention programs are effective at mitigating the negative impact of child maltreatment.

N2  - Purpose: Homeless young women ages 18-23 years are the most vulnerable of unstably-housed youth. They are prone to sexually transmitted infections, unplanned pregnancies, and substance use/ abuse. The study aim was to determine feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a 4-session intervention delivered at a drop-in site. We wanted to explore differences in indicators of psychological capital between participants in the intervention and those in an attention control group immediately following the intervention and 4 weeks later. Method(s): Following IRB approval and written informed consent, 43 eligible homeless young women enrolled in the study (26 intervention and 18 control group; average age = 21.2 years; 45.5% White, lived away from home approximately 57 days). The intervention and control condition were led by two sets of female group facilitators (one nursing student and one social work student) trained by the investigators to follow a manual with content and strategies to enhance psychological capital (intervention) and street health resources (control). Data were collected using valid scales (Cronbach's alpha = .78-.96) by two other students at three times: prior to start-up of either group, immediately following the completion of the 4 sessions, and at a follow-up date 4 weeks later. Following the 4 sessions, participants in both intervention and control groups were each given a cell phone to use for the 4-week period between the second and third data collections. The purpose was to encourage those in the intervention to meet their goals and to remind those in the control group that we would collect data one more time. Each participant received a total of $45 for providing data at all three collections. Result(s): A statistically significant time effect was found in measures of hope (p < .001), resilience (p = .016), future time perspective (p = .025), safer sex behaviors (p < .043), and psychological capital (p = .034), over time, with intervention group participants showing significant improvement in hope (p = .012) and social connectedness (p = .028), and non-significant, but improved, self-efficacy to negotiate safe sex (p = .066). Although scores on self-efficacy to refuse alcohol also increased from baseline to times 2 and 3, a statistically significant time effect was not found. A time by group effect was found for resilience (p = .062) and optimism (p = .081), approaching significance. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the first intervention for homeless youth based on a Positive Psychology paradigm. The significant preliminary intervention findings, despite the small sample size, are encouraging because they indicate that a brief group intervention delivered in a drop-in center may influence young women to enhance their psychological capital. Positive changes in psychological capital that include positive attitudes about the future can contribute to future healthy behaviors and quality of life.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Limited research exists that investigates hospital admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs) among the homeless, who frequently lack a usual source of care. This study profiled ACSC admissions for homeless patients., METHODS: Bivariate analyses and logistic regression were completed to investigate ACSC and non-ACSC admissions among homeless patients using the 2010 California State Inpatient Database., RESULTS: Homeless patients admitted for an ACSC were mostly male, non-Hispanic white, and on average 49.9 years old. In the predictive model, the odds of an ACSC admission among homeless patients increased when they were black, admitted to the emergency department or transferred from another health facility. Having Medicare was associated with a decreased odds of an ACSC admission., CONCLUSIONS: Specific characteristics are associated with a greater likelihood of an ACSC admission. Research should examine how these characteristics contribute to ACSC hospitalizations and findings should be linked to programs designed to serve as a safety-net for homeless patients to reduce hospitalizations.

N2  - A culturally diverse sample of formerly homeless youth (ages 6-12) and their families (n=223) participated in a cluster randomized controlled trial of the Early Risers conduct problems prevention program in a supportive housing setting. Parents provided 4 annual behaviorally-based ratings of executive functioning (EF) and conduct problems, including at baseline, over 2 years of intervention programming, and at a 1-year follow-up assessment. Using intent-to-treat analyses, a multilevel latent growth model revealed that the intervention group demonstrated reduced growth in conduct problems over the 4 assessment points. In order to examine mediation, a multilevel parallel process latent growth model was used to simultaneously model growth in EF and growth in conduct problems along with intervention status as a covariate. A significant mediational process emerged, with participation in the intervention promoting growth in EF, which predicted negative growth in conduct problems. The model was consistent with changes in EF fully mediating intervention-related changes in youth conduct problems over the course of the study. These findings highlight the critical role that EF plays in behavioral change and lends further support to its importance as a target in preventive interventions with populations at risk for conduct problems.

N2  - When nurses possess negative attitudes toward people with low socio-economic status it can negatively influence patient care. This study examines whether providing care in a service-learning environment positively affects nursing students' world views and empathy toward the poor. Using a pre-post design, the Attitudes about Poverty and Poor People Scale and the Just World Scale were administered to both a control group and nursing students engaged in a clinical rotation at a low-income housing facility or homeless shelter in spring and fall 2010. Findings show the service learning treatment modestly enhanced empathy and students' views on justice, while not improving superficial perceptions of the poor.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - Although meditation is increasingly accepted as having personal benefits, less is known about the broader impact of meditation on social and intergroup relations. We tested the effect of lovingkindness meditation training on improving implicit attitudes toward members of 2 stigmatized social outgroups: Blacks and homeless people. Healthy non-Black, nonhomeless adults (N = 101) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: 6-week lovingkindness practice, 6-week lovingkindness discussion (a closely matched active control), or waitlist control. Decreases in implicit bias against stigmatized outgroups (as measured by Implicit Association Test) were observed only in the lovingkindness practice condition. Reduced psychological stress mediated the effect of lovingkindness practice on implicit bias against homeless people, but it did not mediate the reduced bias against Black people. These results suggest that lovingkindness meditation can improve automatically activated, implicit attitudes toward stigmatized social groups and that this effect occurs through distinctive mechanisms for different stigmatized social groups.Copyright PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved.

N2  - African American women at increased risk of HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) may engage in risky sex as a coping mechanism for depressed economic conditions. This study examines the association between high-risk sexual behavior and structural determinants of sexual health among a sample of young African American women. 237 young African American women (16-19 years old) from economically disadvantaged neighborhoods in North Carolina were enrolled into a randomized trial testing the efficacy of an adapted HIV/STI prevention intervention. Logistic regression analyses predicted the likelihood that young women reporting lack of food at home, homelessness and low future prospects would also report sexual risk behaviors. Young women reporting a lack of food at home (22 %), homelessness (27 %), and low perceived education/employment prospects (19 %) had between 2.2 and 4.7 times the odds as those not reporting these risk factors of reporting multiple sex partners, risky sex partners including older men and partners involved in gangs, substance use prior to sex, and exchange sex. Self-reported structural determinants of sexual health were associated with myriad sexual risk behaviors. Diminished economic conditions among these young women may lead to sexual risk due to hopelessness, the need for survival or other factors.

N2  - This study investigates 500 homeless adults and the associations between childhood maltreatment types and the age of first reported homelessness episode. Those first experiencing homelessness in youth (age 24 years or younger; 46%) were compared with those first experiencing homelessness at a later age (older than age 24 years). In individual models, physical abuse, emotional abuse, and emotional neglect were associated with first experiencing homelessness during youth (p < .02 for all types of maltreatment). In the simultaneous model, only emotional abuse remained significantly associated (p = .002). In addition, increasing numbers of maltreatment were associated with becoming homeless during youth (p < .0001). These results highlight the unique associations between childhood maltreatment types and becoming homeless earlier in life and support the need for early interventions with at-risk families.

N2  - This case-control study describes the health situation, internal and external resources, and utilisation of healthcare facilities by a marginalised population consisting of homeless people in Vienna, Austria, compared with a non-homeless control population. Among the homeless group, participants lived in halfway houses (70%) or permanent housing (30%) in Vienna. Personal interviews were conducted in July 2010 with 66 homeless individuals, and their data were compared with data from non-homeless subjects from the Austrian Health Interview Survey using conditional logistic regression. Compared with the control group, homeless persons suffered more often from chronic diseases (P < 0.001) and rated their health considerably lower than the comparison group (P < 0.001). Homeless people suffered significantly more often from psychiatric disorders, respiratory diseases, hypertension (P < 0.001), digestive system diseases (P = 0.002) and heart diseases (P = 0.015) in comparison with the control group. Additionally, among homeless and non-homeless individuals, the former more often consulted a general practitioner in a period of 28 days (P = 0.002). A significantly greater proportion of homeless people did not have any teeth (P = 0.024) and smoked significantly more (P = 0.002). The results demonstrate deficits in the areas of health, health behaviour, and individual and social resources of homeless people, even though homeless people seek medical care at a higher rate than controls. Continuing health promotion projects for this high-risk group and the strengthening of social resources are recommended.Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

T1  - Setting the stage for chronic health problems: cumulative childhood adversity among homeless adults with mental illness in Vancouver, British Columbia

N2  - BACKGROUND: It is well documented that childhood abuse, neglect and household dysfunction are disproportionately present in the backgrounds of homeless adults, and that these experiences adversely impact child development and a wide range of adult outcomes. However, few studies have examined the cumulative impact of adverse childhood experiences on homeless adults with mental illness. This study examines adverse events in childhood as predictors of duration of homelessness, psychiatric and substance use disorders, and physical health in a sample of homeless adults with mental illness., METHODS: This study was conducted using baseline data from a randomized controlled trial in Vancouver, British Columbia for participants who completed the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) scale at 18 months follow-up (n=364). Primary outcomes included current mental disorders; substance use including type, frequency and severity; physical health; duration of homelessness; and vocational functioning., RESULTS: In multivariable regression models, ACE total score independently predicted a range of mental health, physical health, and substance use problems, and marginally predicted duration of homelessness., CONCLUSIONS: Adverse childhood experiences are overrepresented among homeless adults with complex comorbidities and chronic homelessness. Our findings are consistent with a growing body of literature indicating that childhood traumas are potent risk factors for a number of adult health and psychiatric problems, particularly substance use problems. Results are discussed in the context of cumulative adversity and self-trauma theory., TRIALS REGISTRATION: This trial has been registered with the International Standard Randomized Control Trial Number Register and assigned ISRCTN42520374.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Chronically homeless adults with severe alcohol problems are disproportionately burdened with health-care problems and are high utilizers of emergency medical services (EMS). Single-site Housing First (HF), which provides immediate, permanent, low-barrier, nonabstinence-based, supportive housing, has been associated with reduced publicly funded service utilization. The aims of the current study were to determine whether time spent in single-site HF predicted decreases in EMS contacts 2 years subsequent to single-site HF move-in, and to describe medical conditions and injuries associated with EMS contacts in a sample of chronically homeless individuals with severe alcohol problems., METHODS: Participants were 91 chronically homeless adults with severe alcohol problems who were enrolled in a single-site HF program between December 2005 and March 2007 in Seattle, Washington. We obtained administrative data on exposure to HF and EMS utilization for the 2 years prior to and the 2 years subsequent to participants' move-in date. EMS utilization variables included patient type (i.e., primary presenting problem), trauma/injury mechanism (i.e., EMS classification of the cause of the trauma or injury), level of care (i.e., basic life support, advanced life support), and transport destination., RESULTS: After controlling for baseline EMS contacts, participants evinced 3% fewer EMS contacts for each additional month of single-site HF exposure. From the baseline to follow-up period, the mean number of EMS contacts declined from 15.85 (SD = 22.96) to 9.54 (SD = 15.08), representing a 54% reduction in the number of EMS contacts. Most calls were responded to by EMTs providing basic life support, and the majority resulted in transport to a local level I trauma center. The most common presenting difficulties were medical illness and trauma. Substance use and psychiatric difficulties were infrequently documented as the primary problem., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support recent assertions that housing is health care and indicate that the amount of time spent in single-site HF is associated with significant reductions in EMS utilization for at least 2 years subsequent to move-in. These findings also underscore the high levels of medical illness and trauma exposure among chronically homeless adults with severe alcohol problems.

T1  - Reductions in depressive symptoms among substance-abusing runaway adolescents and their primary caretakers: a randomized clinical trial

Y1  - 2014//
N2  - This study reports secondary outcome findings on depressive symptoms from a randomized clinical trial testing three interventions for substance-abusing runaway adolescents. In particular, the effect of a family systems therapy, Ecologically Based Family Therapy (EBFT), and two individual therapies, the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) and Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), on adolescent and primary caretaker (PC) depressive symptoms were compared. Findings showed that youth's depressive symptoms were significantly reduced in each treatment to 2 years postbaseline. However, the trajectory of change differed across treatments, with adolescents receiving MET showing a more rapid reduction in depressive symptoms but a quicker increase in symptoms compared with adolescents receiving EBFT. PCs receiving EBFT showed a statistically significant decline in depressive symptoms, but this was not observed for the CRA and MET conditions. These findings can be interpreted to favor EBFT, although future research is needed to test training and implementation strategies for family systems therapies in community-based runaway shelters.

N2  - This cross-sectional study assessed predictors of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) positivity with baseline data collected on recently released male parolees (N = 157) participating in a randomized trial focused on reduction of drug use, recidivism, and risk for hepatitis and HIV infections. In this sample, the prevalence of HCV was 25%. The logistic regression analysis revealed that being an injection drug user was significantly related to HCV infection. However, contrary to most of the current literature, being Black had significantly lower odds of contracting HCV than their White counterparts. Moreover, having lived on the streets, not being part of a close family in childhood, and being older were also associated with HCV infection. These findings highlight the need for skilled assessments that target the vulnerabilities of homeless adults, especially those who have been incarcerated. Understanding drug use patterns, childhood networks, and family relationships, may assist in the design of interventions to reduce risky drug use and address behaviors derived from disadvantaged childhood.

N2  - Genetic variants as well as increased serum levels of the neurotrophic factor S100B are associated with different psychiatric disorders. However, elevated S100B levels are also related to a better therapeutic outcome in psychiatric patients. The functional role of elevated S100B in psychiatric disorders is still unclear. Hence, this study was designed in order to elucidate the differential effects of S100B overexpression in interaction with chronic social stress during adolescence on emotional behavior and adult neurogenesis. S100B transgenic and wild-type mice were housed either in socially stable or unstable environments during adolescence, between postnatal days 28 and 77. In adulthood, anxiety-related behavior in the open field, dark-light, and novelty-induced suppression of feeding test as well as survival of proliferating hippocampal progenitor cells were assessed. S100B transgenic mice revealed significantly reduced anxiety-related behavior in the open field compared to wild-types when reared in stable social conditions. In contrast, when transgenic mice grew up in unstable social conditions, their level of anxiety-related behavior was comparable to the levels of wild-type mice. In addition, S100B overexpressing mice from unstable housing conditions displayed higher numbers of surviving newborn cells in the adult hippocampus which developed into mature neurons. In conclusion, elevated S100B levels increase the susceptibility to environmental stimuli during adolescence resulting in more variable behavioral and neural phenotypes in adulthood. In humans, this increased plasticity might lead to both, enhanced risk for psychiatric disorders in negative environments and improved therapeutic outcome in positive environments. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background: This is one of three Cochrane reviews that examine the role of the telephone in HIV/AIDS services. Both in developed and developing countries there is a large proportion of people who do not know they are infected with HIV. Knowledge of one's own HIV serostatus is necessary to access HIV support, care and treatment and to prevent acquisition or further transmission of HIV. Using telephones instead of face-to-face or other means of HIV test results delivery could lead to more people receiving their HIV test results. Objective(s): To assess the effectiveness of telephone use for delivery of HIV test results and post-test counselling. To evaluate the effectiveness of delivering HIV test results by telephone, we were interested in whether they can increase the proportion of people who receive their HIV test results and the number of people knowing their HIV status. Search Method(s): We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PubMed Central, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health (CINAHL), WHOs The Global Health Library and Current Controlled Trials from 1980 to June 2011. We also searched grey literature sources such as Dissertation Abstracts International,CAB Direct Global Health, OpenSIGLE, The Healthcare Management Information Consortium, Google Scholar, Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, International AIDS Society and AEGIS Education Global Information System, and reference lists of relevant studies for this review. Selection Criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials (qRCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series (ITS) studies comparing the effectiveness of telephone HIV test results notification and post-test counselling to face-to-face or other ways of HIV test result delivery in people regardless of their demographic characteristics and in all settings. Data Collection and Analysis: Two reviewers independently searched, screened, assessed study quality and extracted data. A third reviewer resolved any disagreement. Main Result(s): Out of 14 717 citations, only one study met the inclusion criteria; an RCT conducted on homeless and high-risk youth between September 1998 and October 1999 in Portland, United States. Participants (n=351) were offered counselling and oral HIV testing and were randomised into face-to-face (n=187 participants) and telephone (n=167) notification groups. The telephone notification group had the option of receiving HIV test results either by telephone or face-to-face. Overall, only 48% (n=168) of participants received their HIV test results and post-test counselling. Significantly more participants received their HIV test results in the telephone notification group compared to the face-to-face notification group; 58% (n=106) vs. 37% (n=62) (p < 0.001). In the telephone notification group, the majority of participants who received their HIV test results did so by telephone (88%, n=93). The study could not offer information about the effectiveness of telephone HIV test notification with HIV-positive participants because only two youth tested positive and both were assigned to the face-to-face notification group. The study had a high risk of bias. Authors' conclusions: We found only one eligible study. Although this study showed the use of the telephone for HIV test results notification was more effective than face-to-face delivery, it had a high-risk of bias. The study was conducted about 13 years ago in a high-income country, on a high-risk population, with low HIV prevalence, and the applicability of its results to other settings and contexts is unclear. The study did not provide information about telephone HIV test results notification of HIV positive people since none of the intervention group participants were HIV positive. We found no information about the acceptability of the intervention to patients' and providers', its economic outcomes or potential adverse effects. There is a need for robust evidence from various settings on the effectiveness of telephone use for HIV test results notification.Copyright © 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration.

N2  - Background: Numbers of street-connected children and young people run into many millions worldwide and include children and young people who live or work in street environments. Whether or not they remain connected to their families of origin, and despite many strengths and resiliencies, they are vulnerable to a range of risks and are excluded from mainstream social structures and opportunities. Objective(s): To summarise the effectiveness of interventions for street-connected children and young people that promote inclusion and reintegration and reduce harms. To explore the processes of successful intervention and models of change in this area, and to understand how intervention effectiveness may vary in different contexts.. Search Method(s): We searched the following bibliographic databases, from inception to 2012, and various relevant non-governmental and organisational websites: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE and PreMEDLINE; EMBASE and EMBASE Classic; CINAHL; PsycINFO; ERIC; Sociological Abstracts; Social Services Abstracts; Social Work Abstracts; Healthstar; LILACS; System for Grey literature in Europe (OpenGrey); ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; EconLit; IDEAS Economics and Finance Research; JOLIS Library Catalog of the holdings of the World Bank Group and IMF Libraries; BLDS (British Library for Development Studies); Google, Google Scholar. Selection Criteria: The review included data from harm reduction or reintegration promotion intervention studies that used a comparison group study design and were all randomised or quasi-randomised studies. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions aimed to benefit street-connected children and young people, aged 0 to 24 years, in all contexts. Data Collection and Analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were extracted on intervention delivery, context, process factors, equity and outcomes. Outcome measures were grouped according to whether they measured psychosocial outcomes, risky sexual behaviours or substance use. A meta-analysis was conducted for some outcomes though it was not possible for all due to differences in measurements between studies. Other outcomes were evaluated narratively. Main Result(s): We included 11 studies evaluating 12 interventions from high income countries. We did not find any sufficiently robust evaluations conducted in low and middle income countries (LMICs) despite the existence of many relevant programmes. Study quality overall was low to moderate and there was great variation in the measurement used by studies, making comparison difficult. Participants were drop-in and shelter based. We found no consistent results on a range of relevant outcomes within domains of psychosocial health, substance misuse and sexual risky behaviours despite the many measurements collected in the studies. The interventions being evaluated consisted of time limited therapeutically based programmes which did not prove more effective than standard shelter or drop-in services for most outcomes and in most studies. There were favourable changes from baseline in outcomes for most particpants in therapy interventions and also in standard services. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies and equity data were inconsistently reported. No study measured the primary outcome of reintegration or reported on adverse effects. The review discussion section included consideration of the relevance of the findings for LMIC settings. Authors' conclusions: Analysis across the included studies found no consistently significant benefit for the 'new' interventions compared to standard services for street-connected children and young people. These latter interventions, however, have not been rigorously evaluated, especially in the context of LMICs. Robustly evaluating the interventions would enable better recommendations to be made for service delivery. There is a need for future research in LMICs that includes children who are on the streets due to urbanisation, war or migration and who may be vulnerable to risks such as trafficking.Copyright © 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration.

N2  - Housing stability is a key component of rehabilitation for individuals with severe mental illnesses but remains a challenge for mental health service providers, particularly with young adults experiencing early mental health difficulties. The aim of this study is to explore perceptions of housing and home-leaving processes among young adults with emerging psychotic disorders and to compare it to the perceptions of young adults without psychotic disorders. A qualitative, grounded theory based, multiple case study was conducted among 52 adults aged 18-30 years old. Two core categories emerged in relation with perception of housing: choice/control over the residential environment, and housing opportunities over time. Difference between the groups include more coerced home-leaving for young adults with first-episode psychosis and low levels of choice, control and opportunities for a sub-group of participants living in group homes. The housing situation of young adults is analyzed and discussed from a systemic perspective.

N2  - Objectives: To examine the efficacy of 3 theoretically distinct interventions among substance-abusing runaway adolescents and to explore individual differences in trajectories of change. Method(s): Adolescents (N = 179) between the ages of 12 and 17 were recruited from a runaway shelter in a midwestern city. The sample included 94 females (52.5%) and 85 males (47.5%); the majority of the adolescents were African American (n = 118, 65.9%). Adolescents were randomly assigned to the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA, n = 57), Motivational Interviewing (MI, n = 61), or Ecologically-Based Family Therapy (EBFT, n = 61). Substance use was assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months via Form 90 and urine screens. Result(s): Hierarchical linear modeling revealed statistically significant improvement in frequency of substance use among runaways in all 3 treatment groups, with a slight increase at posttreatment. Latent trajectory profile analysis explored individual differences in change trajectories and yielded a 3-class model. The majority of adolescents (n = 136, 76%) showed reductions in substance use over time, with a slight increase at follow-up (Class 1: Decreasing). Twenty-four (13.4%) adolescents had shown high levels of substance use over time with patterns of increase and decrease (Class 2: Fluctuating high users), and 19 (10.6%) decreased but returned to baseline levels by 2 years postbaseline (Class 3: U shaped). Few differences among treatment conditions were noted; within the "decreasing" group, adolescents in MI treatment showed a quicker decline in their substance use but a faster relapse compared with those receiving EBFT. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that CRA, EBFT, and MI are viable treatments for runaway substance-abusing adolescents. © 2013 American Psychological Association.

N2  - This study examined whether life stress was associated with elevated sexual risk among young transgender women and whether this relationship was mediated by alcohol and substance use. The analysis was based on data collected from 116 transgender women aged 16 to 25 as part of a baseline assessment for an HIV prevention intervention. The median age was 20; the majority identifed as African American (48%) or Hispanic (32%). Controlling for age, high life stress was associated with an increased odds of sexual risk (OR = 2.39; 95% CI 1.12-5.12). This association was attenuated when substance and alcohol use were added to the model (OR = 1.82; 0.80- 4.13). A formal test of the mediation hypothesis indicated a statistically signifcant indirect effect (beta = 0.08; 95% CI 0.02-0.20). Interventions aimed at reducing sexual risk behavior should address problems with substance use as well as more distal factors that impact risk, such homelessness, joblessness, and lack of access to medical care. © 2013 The Guilford Press.

N2  - Background: Treatment nonadherence in people with schizophrenia is associated with relapse and homelessness. Building on the usefulness of long-acting medication and our work in psychosocial interventions to enhance adherence, we conducted a prospective uncontrolled trial of customized adherence enhancement (CAE) plus long-acting injectable antipsychotic (LAI) using haloperidol decanoate in 30 homeless or recently homeless individuals with DSM-IV-defined schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Method(s): Participants received monthly CAE and LAI (CAE-L) for 6 months. Primary outcomes were adherence, as measured by the Tablets Routine Questionnaire, and housing status. Secondary outcomes included psychiatric symptoms, functioning, side effects, and hospitalizations. The study was conducted from July 2010 to December 2012. Result(s): The mean age of participants was 41.8 years (SD = 8.6); they were mainly minorities (90%, n = 27 African-American) and mainly single/never married (70%, n = 21). Most (97%, n = 29) had past or current substance abuse and had been incarcerated (97%, n = 29). Ten individuals (33%) terminated the study prematurely. CAE-L was associated with good adherence to LAI (at 6 months, 76%) and dramatic improvement in oral medication adherence, which changed from missing 46% of medication at study enrollment to missing only 10% at study end (P = .03). There were significant improvements in psychiatric symptoms (P < .001) and functioning (P < .001). Akathisia was a major side effect with LAI. Conclusion(s): While interpretation of findings must be tempered by the methodological limitations, CAE-L appears to be associated with improved adherence, symptoms, and functioning in homeless or recently homeless individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Additional research is needed on effective and practical approaches to improving health outcomes for homeless people with serious mental illness. © Copyright 2013 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

N2  - Background: Numbers of street-connected children and young people run into many millions worldwide and include children and young people who live or work in street environments. Whether or not they remain connected to their families of origin, and despite many strengths and resiliencies, they are vulnerable to a range of risks and are excluded from mainstream social structures and opportunities. Objective(s): To summarise the effectiveness of interventions for street-connected children and young people that promote inclusion and reintegration and reduce harms. To explore the processes of successful intervention and models of change in this area, and to understand how intervention effectiveness may vary in different contexts. Search Method(s): We searched the following bibliographic databases, from inception to 2012, and various relevant non-governmental and organisational websites: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE and PreMEDLINE; EMBASE and EMBASE Classic; CINAHL; PsycINFO; ERIC; Sociological Abstracts; Social Services Abstracts; Social Work Abstracts; Healthstar; LILACS; System for Grey literature in Europe (OpenGrey); ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; EconLit; IDEAS Economics and Finance Research; JOLIS Library Catalog of the holdings of the World Bank Group and IMF Libraries; BLDS (British Library for Development Studies); Google, Google Scholar. Selection Criteria: The review included data from harm reduction or reintegration promotion intervention studies that used a comparison group study design and were all randomised or quasi-randomised studies. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions aimed to benefit street-connected children and young people, aged 0 to 24 years, in all contexts. Data Collection and Analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were extracted on intervention delivery, context, process factors, equity and outcomes. Outcome measures were grouped according to whether they measured psychosocial outcomes, risky sexual behaviours or substance use. A meta-analysis was conducted for some outcomes though it was not possible for all due to differences in measurements between studies. Other outcomes were evaluated narratively. Main Result(s): We included 11 studies evaluating 12 interventions from high income countries. We did not find any sufficiently robust evaluations conducted in low and middle income countries (LMICs) despite the existence of many relevant programmes. Study quality overall was low to moderate and there was great variation in the measurement used by studies, making comparison difficult. Participants were drop-in and shelter based. We found no consistent results on a range of relevant outcomes within domains of psychosocial health, substance misuse and sexual risky behaviours despite the many measurements collected in the studies. The interventions being evaluated consisted of time limited therapeutically based programmes which did not prove more effective than standard shelter or drop-in services for most outcomes and in most studies. There were favourable changes from baseline in outcomes for most particpants in therapy interventions and also in standard services. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies and equity data were inconsistently reported. No study measured the primary outcome of reintegration or reported on adverse effects. The review discussion section included consideration of the relevance of the findings for LMIC settings. Authors' conclusions: Analysis across the included studies found no consistently significant benefit for the 'new' interventions compared to standard services for street-connected children and young people. These latter interventions, however, have not been rigorously evaluated, especially in the context of LMICs. Robustly evaluating the interventions would enable better recommendations to be made for service delivery. There is a need for future research in LMICs that includes children who are on the streets due to urbanisation, war or migration and who may be vulnerable to risks such as trafficking. Plain Language Summary: Interventions for reducing risks and promoting inclusion of street children and young people There are millions of children and young people estimated to be living and working on the streets around the world. Many have become resilient but continue to be vulnerable to risks. To promote their best chances in life, services are needed to reduce risks and prevent marginalisation from mainstream society. Eleven studies evaluating 12 interventions have been rigorously conducted of services to support street-connected children and youth, all in the developed world. They compared therapy-based services with usual shelter and drop-in services. The results of these studies were mixed but overall we found that participants receiving therapy or usual services benefitted to a similar level. There is a need for research which considers the benefit of usual drop-in and shelter services, most particularly in low and middle income countries, and which includes participation of street-connected children and young people. None of the studies included participants that were comparable to some street children in low income countries, who may be on the street primarily to earn a living or as a result of war, migration or urbanisation.© 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration.

N2  - Given high levels of health and psychological costs associated with the family disruption of homelessness, identifying predictors of runaway and homeless episodes is an important goal. The current study followed 179 substance abusing, shelter-recruited adolescents who participated in a randomized clinical trial. Predictors of runaway and homeless episodes were examined over a two year period. Results from the hierarchical linear modeling analysis showed that family cohesion and substance use, but not family conflict or depressive symptoms, delinquency, or school enrollment predicted future runaway and homeless episodes. Findings suggest that increasing family support, care and connection and reducing substance use are important targets of intervention efforts in preventing future runaway and homeless episodes amongst a high risk sample of adolescents. © 2013 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

N2  - In California, the Mental Health Services Act allocated substantial funding to Full Service Partnerships (FSPs): programs that do whatever it takes to improve residential stability and mental health outcomes. The state-guided, but stakeholder-driven, approach to FSPs resulted in a set of programs that share core similarities but vary in their specific approaches. This qualitative study examines FSP variations within the framework of fidelity to the Housing First model. Semistructured interviews with 21 FSP program managers identified through purposeful sampling were coded and analyzed to identify variations across programs in their approaches to housing and services. Through the process of constant comparison, FSP characteristics were condensed into a set of broad themes related to fidelity to the Housing First model. We identified three broad themes: (a) FSPs varied in the degree to which key elements of Housing First were present; (b) program recovery orientation and staff experience were associated with fidelity; and (c) FSPs for older adults, adults exiting the justice system, and transitional age youth made specific adaptations to tailor their programs for the needs of their specific populations. FSPs bring a considerable level of community-based housing and treatment resources to homeless persons with serious mental illness. However, when examined individually, there exists enough variation in approaches to housing and treatment to raise the question whether some programs may be more or less effective than others. An opportunity exists to employ the variation in FSPs implemented under this initiative to analyze the importance of fidelity to HF for client outcomes, program costs, and recovery-oriented care. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Purpose: We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between social network characteristics and street youths' shelter use, a determinant of health outcomes for homeless youth. Method(s): We analyzed interview data from 138 street youth recruited through venue-based sampling in San Francisco, to assess the cross-sectional relationship between shelter use in youths' social networks and youths' reported shelter use. We also assessed the relationship between baseline network shelter use and shelter use at 6-month follow-up. Result(s): Low proportions of street youth reported shelter use at baseline (38%) and follow-up (29.6%). Twenty-nine (26.9%) youth were in networks with shelter users at baseline, compared with 17 youth (15.7%) at follow-up. In cross-sectional analysis, youth in networks with shelter users had 5-fold increased odds of reporting shelter use (OR: 5.86, p =.006). A 1-person increase in the number of network shelter users was associated with 2-fold increased odds of youths' shelter use (OR: 2.16, p =.02). In longitudinal analysis, youth in networks with shelter users at baseline had nearly 5-fold increased odds of shelter use at follow-up (OR: 4.95, p =.01). A 1-person increase in the number of network shelter users at baseline was associated with 3-fold increased odds of shelter use at follow-up (OR: 3.15, p =.004). Conclusion(s): Shelter users seem to cluster together. Shelter use by extended network members was associated with increased odds of youths' own shelter use. Understanding how network behaviors influence street youths' health-related behaviors, such as shelter use, could inform network-based interventions encouraging service uptake among marginalized and hard-to-reach street youth populations. © 2013 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

N2  - Objective: To compare the voice performance of children involved in street labor with regular children using perceptual-auditory and acoustic analyses. Method(s): A controlled cross-sectional study was carried out on 7- to 10-year-old children of both genders. Children from both groups lived with their families and attended school regularly; however, child labor was evident in one group and not the other. A total of 200 potentially eligible street children, assisted by the Child Labor Elimination Programme (PETI), and 400 regular children were interviewed. Those with any vocal discomfort (106, 53% and 90, 22.5%) had their voices assessed for resonance, pitch, loudness, speech rate, maximum phonation time, and other acoustic measurements. Result(s): A total of 106 street children (study group [SG]) and 90 regular children (control group [CG]) were evaluated. The SG group demonstrated higher oral and nasal resonance, reduced loudness, a lower pitch, and a slower speech rate than the CG. The maximum phonation time, fundamental frequency, and upper harmonics were higher in the SG than the CG. Jitter and shimmer were higher in the CG than the SG. Conclusion(s): Using perceptual-auditory and acoustic analyses, we determined that there were differences in voice performance between the two groups, with street children having better quality perceptual and acoustic vocal parameters than regular children. We believe that this is due to the procedures and activities performed by the Child Labor Elimination Program (PETI), which helps children to cope with their living conditions. © 2013 The Voice Foundation.

N2  - Background and objectives: It is well established that animal source foods (ASF) is a major contribution to the diet, yet parents who never serve eggs and red meat are keeping children away from the most concentrated sources of proteins, vitamins and minerals that promote the growth and enhance child's immunity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Animal Source Food (ASF) on the growth of malnourished children in Kelantan, Malaysia. Method(s): A six months of ASF intervention trial was carried out in 90 malnourished children of food insecure households in a rural area of Malaysia. Children were randomized into three groups: 30 children was assigned to Milk group (M) who consumed two carton of 250 ml milk daily over the study period; in Egg group (E), 30 children consumed two eggs daily and Control group (C) (n=30).Anthropometric data were collected at baseline, at 3 and 6 months of the trial. Result(s): Over the study period there was a significant increase in height, weight and Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) when One- way repeated measures ANOVA was performed. However, there was no significant differences of increments in height, weight and MUAC were observed between the groups. Conclusion(s): The provision of ASF trial improved weight, height and MUAC among malnourished children.

N2  - A large proportion of premature infants require some form of mechanical respiratory support. Because of the association between invasive ventilation and lung injury there is a strong emphasis in using less invasive forms of respiratory support in these infants. These include NCPAP, Nasal ventilation, patient triggered or synchronized ventilation, and volume targeted ventilation. Noninvasive respiratory support, CPAP and N-SIMV have been used as means of avoiding invasive ventilation and improving weaning success. Randomized trials have shown lower extubation failure and better respiratory evolution with N-SIMV in comparison to NCPAP alone. Some studies comparing initial use of non-invasive IMV with NCPAP in infants with RDS showed a lower intubation rate and reduced oxygen dependency with noninvasive IMV. The aim of Patient Triggered Ventilation (PTV) is that each mechanical breath be triggered by the infant's own inspiratory effort achieving synchronization between the patient and the ventilator. During PTV the infant determines his/her own respiratory rate and tidal volumes are generated with lower airway pressures than during non-synchronized ventilation. By eliminating asynchrony between patient and ventilator, PTV can improve ventilation and reduce agitation and episodes of hypoxemia. By preserving spontaneous breathing PTV also facilitates weaning from IPPV and shortens the duration of mechanical ventilation in preterm infants. Possible drawbacks of PTV include increased dead space produced by the pneumotachographs used to trigger the ventilator and this may produce CO2 retention in the smaller infants. Low trigger sensitivity may result in lack or delayed triggering while excessive sensitivity may cause auto-triggering resulting in runaway mechanical rate, hyperventilation, and gas trapping. This can occur when there are large leaks around the endotracheal tube or there is water condensation in the ventilator circuit.Volume Targeted Ventilation (VTV) is available in the newer neonatal ventilators. These systems measure the volume delivered to the patient as well as the expired tidal volume and continuously adjust the peak inspiratory pressure to maintain a preset expired tidal volume. This mode allows a significant reduction in PIP when the infant is able to generate a preset tidal volume on his own. On the other hand, it increases airway pressure to maintain a constant tidal volume when the infant does not make enough effort or when the mechanical characteristics of the respiratory system worsen. The use of VTV has been associated with shorter duration of MV and lower incidence of brain hemorrhage, pneumothorax and death or BPD.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: There is no study empirically comparing the racial disparity in hospital inpatient cost between homeless and non-homeless patients. This paper compares hospital inpatient costs between homeless and non-homeless patients across race groups. This paper further provides comprehensive descriptive information on patient characteristics, insurance coverage, disease prevalence, and severity of illness for homeless patients and non-homeless patients by race groups. METHOD(S): We employed propensity score matching to create two cohorts, where inpatient hospital visits between homeless and non-homeless patients were matched based on patients' demographics and clinical information, and hospital types. These new similar cohorts were then used to compare the cost per hospital visit between homeless and non-homeless patients through multivariate regression analysis. The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Databases (SID) for 2009 were used. Data were drawn from 579 hospitals reporting data on homelessness in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. SID provide detailed diagnoses, procedures, total charges and patient demographics including homelessness. We linked SID files with American Hospital Association Annual Survey Database and Area Resource File to obtain hospital and area level characteristics. RESULT(S): We find significant variations in hospital inpatient costs between homeless and non-homeless patients across race groups. Our risk adjusted results show that homeless patients generally have lower inpatient costs when compared to non-homeless patients. We find that homeless white patients have higher inpatient costs and non-homeless white patients have lower inpatient costs when compared to their homeless non-white and non-homeless non-white counterparts respectively. We also find that the majority of homeless children at hospital inpatient departments are non-white. In addition, about a third of all inpatient hospital visits by white homeless patients are for female individuals. CONCLUSION(S): This study provides comprehensive empirical evidence for racial disparity in hospital inpatient costs between homeless and non-homeless patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: One of the main priorities of Dutch organisations providing shelter services is to develop evidence-based interventions in the care for abused women and homeless people. To date, most of these organisations have not used specific intervention models and the interventions which have been implemented rarely have an empirical and theoretical foundation. The present studies aim to examine the effectiveness of critical time intervention (CTI) for abused women and homeless people., METHODS: In two multi-centre randomised controlled trials we investigate whether CTI, a time-limited (nine month) outreach intervention, is more effective than care-as-usual for abused women and homeless people making the transition from shelter facilities to supported or independent housing. Participants were recruited in 19 women's shelter facilities and 22 homeless shelter facilities across The Netherlands and randomly allocated to the intervention group (CTI) or the control group (care-as-usual). They were interviewed four times in nine months: once before leaving the shelter, and then at three, six and nine months after leaving the shelter. Quality of life (primary outcome for abused women) and recurrent loss of housing (primary outcome for homeless people) as well as secondary outcomes (e.g. care needs, self-esteem, loneliness, social support, substance use, psychological distress and service use) were assessed during the interviews. In addition, the model integrity of CTI was investigated during the data collection period., DISCUSSION: Based on international research CTI is expected to be an appropriate intervention for clients making the transition from institutional to community living. If CTI proves to be effective for abused women and homeless people, shelter services could include this case management model in their professional standards and improve the (quality of) services for clients., TRIAL REGISTRATION: NTR3463 and NTR3425.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patients experiencing homelessness represent a disproportionate share of emergency department (ED) visits due to poor access to primary care and high levels of unmet health care needs. This is in part due to the difficulty of communicating and following up with patients who are experiencing homelessness., OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and types of "new media" use among ED patients who experience homelessness., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional observational study with sequential enrolling of patients from three emergency departments 24/7 for 6 weeks. In total, 5788 ED patients were enrolled, of whom 249 experienced homelessness. Analyses included descriptive statistics, and unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios., RESULTS: 70.7% (176/249) of patients experiencing homelessness own cell phones compared to 85.90% (4758/5539) of patients in stable housing (P=.001) with the former more likely to own Androids, 70% (53/76) versus 43.89% (1064/2424), and the latter more likely to have iPhones, 44.55% (1080/2424) versus 17% (13/76) (P=.001). There is no significant difference in new media use, modality, or frequency for both groups; however, there is a difference in contract plan with 50.02% (2380/4758) of stably housed patients having unlimited minutes versus 37.5% (66/176) of homeless patients. 19.78% (941/4758) of patients in stable housing have pay-as-you-go plans versus 33.0% (58/176) of homeless patients (P=.001). Patients experiencing homelessness are more likely to want health information on alcohol/substance abuse, mental health, domestic violence, pregnancy and smoking cessation., CONCLUSIONS: This study is unique in its characterization of new media ownership and use among ED patients experiencing homelessness. New media is a powerful tool to connect patients experiencing homelessness to health care.

N2  - Objective: Although multiple social and behavioral risk factors associated with obesity co-occur among young children, most studies have examined them separately. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between social risk factors, behavioral problems, health behaviors, and obesity among preschoolers in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 1589). METHOD(S): A cumulative social risk score was created by summing maternal reports of intimate partner violence, food insecurity, housing insecurity, maternal depressive symptoms, maternal substance use, and father's incarceration, obtained when the child was 3 years old. Mothers reported on the child's internalizing and externalizing behaviors with the Child Behavior Checklist at age 5 years. Mothers also reported on hours the child spent watching television and sleeping as well as servings of soda or juice drinks the child consumed per day. Child height and weight were measured at age 5 years. Obesity was defined as body mass index >=95th percentile. Result(s): In regression analyses adjusted for health behaviors, behavioral problems, and sociodemographic factors, cumulative social risk was associated with obesity among girls. Externalizing behavioral problems were associated with obesity among girls (prevalence ratios [PRs], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-1.7) and boys (PR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6). Short sleep duration was also associated with obesity among girls (PR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.4) and boys (PR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5) even after adjusting for behavioral problems and social risk factors. Watching more than 2 hours of television per day was associated with obesity among boys (PR 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9) but not girls. Conclusion(s): Co-occurring social and behavioral risk factors are associated with obesity among 5-year-old children. Copyright © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - The problem of waiting list attrition in addiction treatment programs is widespread, and homeless and marginally housed individuals are particularly susceptible. This naturalistic, retrospective study describes an intervention (Transitional Supportive Housing and Case Management) that effectively promoted treatment admission for this high-risk group above and beyond that which could be explained by certain pretreatment factors. The clinical records of 211 military veterans referred to intensive outpatient addiction treatment were reviewed for factors related to treatment program admission, including 3 interventions designed to prevent waiting list attrition. Chi-square tests evaluated univariate predictors of treatment entry, and a hierarchical binary logistic regression evaluated several variables simultaneously. Results showed that fewer than 50% of wait-listed patients achieved treatment admission. Univariate predictors of treatment entry were not having a current partner, having a legal problem, and having had past substance use disorder treatment. The logistic regression showed that patients who received the intervention were 4.5 times more likely to enter the treatment program, and individuals with a current legal problem were 2.5 times more likely to enter treatment. Participation in a weekly support group and/or contact with a psychiatric nurse practitioner did not increase the likelihood of program admission. It may be possible to enhance treatment entry for the homeless and marginally housed by providing case management and housing services. Future research is needed to determine how the individual-level factors predicting treatment entry in this study can be used to tailor other interventions to further address the problem of waiting list attrition.Copyright PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved.

N2  - There is growing awareness of the role of stigma and discrimination in HIV prevention, testing, and medical care. Yet, few studies have examined the stigma associated with using illicit drugs. In the present study, we examined the relationship between social network characteristics, drug user stigma, and depression. Study participants were comprised of 340 individuals who reported cocaine, crack, and/or heroin use in the prior 6 months and were involved in an HIV prevention study. They were recruited through street outreach, referrals, and word of mouth in inner-city Baltimore, MD, USA. The stigma scale was comprised of eight items, such as "how much do you feel ashamed of using drugs?" Depression was assessed with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, using cutoffs of 16 and 20 or greater. In the bivariate analyses, gender, homelessness in the past 6 months, drug user stigma, larger size of drug network, and current use of heroin, cocaine, and crack were all significantly associated with high levels of depression, whereas in the multivariate analyses, only drug user stigma remained significantly associated with depression. The results of this study suggest that drug treatment providers and other professionals who provide services to drug users should consider developing trainings to address drug user stigma. These programs should focus on the attitudes and behaviors of health and service providers toward drug users, among drug users themselves, and among family members and others who provide social support to drug users.

N2  - Homeless gay and bisexual (G/B) young men have multiple risk factors that increase their risk of contracting hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This study used baseline information from structured instruments to assess correlates of knowledge to HIV and HBV infection from 267 young (18-39 year old) G/B active methamphetamine, cocaine, and crack-using homeless men enrolled in a longitudinal trial. The study is designed to reduce drug use and improve knowledge of hepatitis and HIV/AIDS in a community center in Hollywood, California. Regression modeling revealed that previous hepatitis education delivered to G/B men was associated with higher levels of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis knowledge. Moreover, higher HIV/AIDS knowledge was associated with combining sex and drinking alcohol. Associations with hepatitis B knowledge was found among G/B men who were engaging in sex while under the influence of marijuana, who were receiving support from non-drug users, and who had been homeless in the last 4 months. Although being informed about HIV/AIDS and hepatitis did not preclude risky sexual and drug use behavior, knowledge about the dangers of concurrent sex with substance use is important. As higher levels of knowledge of hepatitis was associated with more moderate drug use, early access to testing and teaching harm reduction strategies remain critical to reduce exposure and infection of HBV and HIV in this population. © The Author(s) 2013.

T1  - Characteristics of emergency department visits by older versus younger homeless adults in the United States
A1  - Brown R.T.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - We compared the characteristics of emergency department (ED) visits of older versus younger homeless adults. We analyzed 2005-2009 data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, a nationally representative survey of visits to hospitals and EDs, and used sampling weights, strata, and clustering variables to obtain nationally representative estimates. The ED visits of homeless adults aged 50 years and older accounted for 36% of annual visits by homeless patients. Although demographic characteristics of ED visits were similar in older and younger homeless adults, clinical and health services characteristics differed. Older homeless adults had fewer discharge diagnoses related to psychiatric conditions (10% vs 20%; P = .002) and drug abuse (7% vs 15%; P = .003) but more diagnoses related to alcohol abuse (31% vs 23%; P = .03) and were more likely to arrive by ambulance (48% vs 36%; P = .02) and to be admitted to the hospital (20% vs 11%; P = .003). Conclusions. Older homeless adults' patterns of ED care differ from those of younger homeless adults. Health care systems need to account for these differences to meet the needs of the aging homeless population.

T1  - Health and eating behavior differs between lean/normal and overweight/obese low-income women living in food-insecure environments
A1  - Dressler H.
A1  - Smith C. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - PURPOSE: To explore differences and similarities in environmental, personal, and behavioral factors influencing eating behavior among low-income women of varying weight status., DESIGN: Focus groups (n = 16) were used to collect qualitative data. Quantitative data collected included demographic, lifestyle, and anthropometric (heights and weights)., SETTING: Community centers, libraries, and homeless shelters in low-income neighborhoods., PARTICIPANTS: Of the 83 participants, 58% were African-American, 28% were white, and the remainder were American Indian, Hispanic, or mixed race. A total of 35% of participants were lean/normal (body mass index <25 kg/m(2)) and 65% were overweight/obese (body mass index >25 kg/m(2))., METHOD: Focus group methodology was used to collect data on 83 participants. Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) provided the theoretical basis. Transcripts were analyzed using the open-coding method and comments between lean/normal and overweight/obese women were systematically compared., RESULTS: Focus group themes were food environment, aberrant eating behavior, health values, and beliefs. Differences in personal and behavioral factors were apparent between overweight/obese and lean/normal women, with the former group frequently discussing emotional eating, overeating, and stashing food, and the latter group communicating greater nutrition knowledge and describing regular physical activity. Both groups similarly expressed experiences with food insecurity and lived in low-income environments., CONCLUSION: For low-income women, personal and behavioral factors may modify the influence of their obesogenic food environment. Further research within the context of SCT should examine differences between lean/normal and overweight/obese women living in the same environment.

N2  - In a prospective two-group pilot study of a convenient sample of 156 young adults, we assessed improvement in HIV cognitive and transmission knowledge, hepatitis knowledge, and mental health at six-month follow-up. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed higher six-month scores in total HIV/AIDS knowledge, HIV/AIDS cognitive knowledge, HIV transmission knowledge and HBV and HCV knowledge at 6 months in the Hepatitis Health Promotion (HHP) group compared to the Art Messaging (AM) group. Moreover, homeless young participants who reported having significant others in their lives, and excellent or very good health did better than their counterparts. Youth who were attempting to get their lives together had higher scores for all types of knowledge except HBV. Hallucinogen users had significantly worse scores on all knowledge measures than non-users. Lastly, the HHP group revealed an improvement in psychological well-being compared to the AM group.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Background: This study evaluated environmental, personal, and behavioral correlates of BMI-for-age percentiles, dietary intake (kilocalories, carbohydrates, protein, fat, and Food Guide Pyramid food groups), and physical activity variables among homeless children. Method(s): A 74-item survey, using social cognitive theory as the theoretical framework, height, weight, and one 24-hour recall were collected from homeless children aged 9-13 (n=159) at two shelters in Minneapolis, MN. Principal component analysis was performed on the subsections of the survey. Independent t-tests, Fisher exact tests, and chi-squared statistics evaluated sociodemographic and BMI percentile variables. Nonparametric tests evaluated dietary data. Stepwise regression models evaluated correlates of BMI percentiles, physical activity, and dietary intake variables. Result(s): Approximately 45% were overweight or obese (>=85th percentile). Dietary data represented intake on a given day, with children consuming a median 1.2 servings from the fruits and vegetables food group, 17.3 servings from the fats and sweets food group (one serving=grams in 1 Tbsp. fat/1 tsp. sugar), and the percent of calories from fat varying significantly between shelter 1 (S1) versus shelter 2 (S2) boys (37.1% vs. 31.7%, p<0.001). Factors identified from survey items and sociodemographic variables accounted for between 6% and 14% of the variance in energy intake and other dietary and physical activity variables (p range, 0.008 to <0.001). Conclusion(s): Parental role modeling of eating behaviors and getting enough food were associated with less favorable food choices among homeless children. Policy interventions and program initiatives in the homeless environment could promote healthier food choices among children. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.

N2  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of food incentives on adherence to tuberculosis (TB) drug treatment among homeless patients with TB. Food packages were thus given as a part of directly observed therapy to 142 homeless patients with TB at a dispensary in Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation. In addition, a social worker provided the patients with information and legal assistance, for example help with internal passports. Among the 142 patients, 66 were included in the study at the dispensary during their entire treatment period, while 76 patients were included in the study during shorter periods mainly because of transfer to inpatient care. In the first group, 59% of the patients continued the TB drug treatment without interruption in contrast to 31% in a control group. In the second group, that is those studied during shorter periods, 95% continued the TB drug treatment without interruption while attached to the dispensary. Food was introduced in the TB programme of the City of St. Petersburg as a consequence of this study. In conclusion, it can be stated that the food incentive had a strong positive impact on the adherence to TB drug treatment among these socially marginalized patients. The social support contributed in all probability also to the positive results. © 2012 The Authors. Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences © 2012 Nordic College of Caring Science.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Perceptions of the danger of crime are typically discussed in the context of people's fear that they will be harmed by offenders. We shift the focus and examine the association between perceived danger and offending and the contribution of these perceptions to the well-established relationship between violent victimization and crime. We hypothesize that violence may embolden some victims and contribute to their perception that offending is not dangerous. We examine the mediating effects of these perceptions alongside two other potential links between violent victimization and crime: deviant definitions and risk seeking. Our analyses of data from a sample of homeless youth find that violent victimization is strongly associated with four types of offending--theft, drug use, drug selling, and prostitution--and that perceived danger significantly mediates several of these relationships. Our results suggest that perceived danger may be an important mechanism connecting victimization and crime.

N2  - A pilot baby clinic in a hostel for homeless families has been established to address the specific attachment and developmental needs of infants living in temporary accommodation. The aim of this study was to assess whether this clinic model was associated with more positive outcomes than mainstream community services in terms of infant development and parent-infant interactions. Parent-infant psychotherapy and health visiting services collaborated to develop a new model of baby clinic, which reconfigured the traditional clinic to give priority to infants' affective experiences in a therapeutic group setting. Outcomes for parent-infant dyads in a homeless hostel where this service model was applied were compared with outcomes for parents and infants in hostels, which did not have such a service. Fifty-nine mother-baby dyads participated in evaluation, 30 in the intervention hostel group and 29 living in comparison hostels. Infant mental and motor development was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Interactions between the parents and infants were video-recorded and coded on the Coding Interactive Behaviour Scales. The indices of mental and motor development of infants in the intervention hostel were significantly improved over time in relation to infants in the comparison hostels. No significant differences were found in the quality of parent-infant interaction between the two groups over time. The findings indicate that the service model may have positive benefits for infant development. The findings, study limitations, and clinical implications are discussed. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Parents and infants living in temporary accommodation represent a high-risk and hard-to-reach population. A new model of intervention, which combines universal infant health services with a therapeutic parent-infant group may be an effective means of supporting the emotional needs of hard-to-reach parents and infants. © 2011 The British Psychological Society.

T1  - Medicaid expansion initiative in Massachusetts: enrollment among substance-abusing homeless adults
A1  - Zur J.
A1  - Mojtabai R. 
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - We assessed whether homeless adults entering substance abuse treatment in Massachusetts were less likely than others to enroll in Medicaid after implementation of the MassHealth Medicaid expansion program in 1997. We used interrupted time-series analysis in data on substance abuse treatment admissions from the Treatment 0Episode Data Set (1992-2009) to evaluate Medicaid coverage rates in Massachusetts and to identify whether trends differed between homeless and housed participants. We also compared Massachusetts data with data from 17 other states and the District of Columbia combined. The percentage of both homeless and housed people entering treatment with Medicaid increased approximately 21% after expansion (P = .01), with an average increase of 5.4% per year over 12 years (P = .01). The increase in coverage was specific to Massachusetts, providing evidence that the MassHealth policy was the cause of this increase. Findings provide evidence in favor of state participation in the Medicaid expansion in January 2014 under the Affordable Care Act and suggest that hard-to-reach vulnerable groups such as substance-abusing homeless adults are as likely as other population groups to benefit from this policy.

T1  - Health and eating behavior differs between lean/normal and overweight/obese low-income women living in food-insecure environments
A1  - Dressler H.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - To explore differences and similarities in environmental, personal, and behavioral factors influencing eating behavior among low-income women of varying weight status. Focus groups (n = 16) were used to collect qualitative data. Quantitative data collected included demographic, lifestyle, and anthropometric (heights and weights). Community centers, libraries, and homeless shelters in low-income neighborhoods. Of the 83 participants, 58% were African-American, 28% were white, and the remainder were American Indian, Hispanic, or mixed race. A total of 35% of participants were lean/normal (body mass index <25 kg/m(2)) and 65% were overweight/obese (body mass index >25 kg/m(2)). Focus group methodology was used to collect data on 83 participants. Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) provided the theoretical basis. Transcripts were analyzed using the open-coding method and comments between lean/normal and overweight/obese women were systematically compared. Focus group themes were food environment, aberrant eating behavior, health values, and beliefs. Differences in personal and behavioral factors were apparent between overweight/obese and lean/normal women, with the former group frequently discussing emotional eating, overeating, and stashing food, and the latter group communicating greater nutrition knowledge and describing regular physical activity. Both groups similarly expressed experiences with food insecurity and lived in low-income environments. For low-income women, personal and behavioral factors may modify the influence of their obesogenic food environment. Further research within the context of SCT should examine differences between lean/normal and overweight/obese women living in the same environment.

N2  - Housing instability, a growing public health problem, may be an independent environmental risk factor for hypertension, but limited prospective data exist. We sought to determine the independent association of housing instability in early adulthood (year 5, 1990-1991) and incident hypertension over the subsequent 15 years of follow-up (years 7, 10, 15, and 20) in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study (N = 5,115). Because causes of inadequate housing and its effects on health are thought to vary by race and sex, we hypothesized that housing instability would exert a differential effect on incident hypertension by race and sex. At year 5, all CARDIA participants were asked about housing and those free of hypertension were analyzed (N = 4,342). We defined housing instability as living in overcrowded housing, moving frequently, or living doubled up. Of the 4,342 participants, 8.5 % were living in unstable housing. Across all participants, housing instability was not associated with incident hypertension (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1.1; 95 % CI, 0.9-1.5) after adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status, substance use, social factors, body mass index, and study site. However, the association varied by race and sex (p value for interaction, <0.001). Unstably housed white women had a hypertension incidence rate 4.7 times (IRR, 4.7; 95 % CI, 2.4-9.2) that of stably housed white women in adjusted analysis. There was no association among white men, black women, or black men. These findings suggest that housing instability may be a more important risk factor among white women, and may act independently or as a marker for other psychosocial stressors (e.g., stress from intimate partner violence) leading to development of hypertension. Studies that examine the role of these psychosocial stressors in development of hypertension risk among unstably housed white women are needed.

T1  - Homelessness, cigarette smoking and desire to quit: results from a US national study

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - AIMS: We determined whether or not homelessness is associated with cigarette smoking independent of other socio-economic measures and behavioral health factors, and whether homeless smokers differ from non-homeless smokers in their desire to quit., DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed data from 2678 adult respondents to the 2009 Health Center Patient Survey, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of homeless and non-homeless individuals using US federally funded community health centers., MEASUREMENTS: We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between homelessness and (i) current cigarette smoking among all adults, and (ii) past-year desire to quit among current smokers, adjusting for demographic, socio-economic and behavioral health characteristics., FINDINGS: Adults with any history of homelessness were more likely than never homeless respondents to be current smokers (57 versus 27%, P<0.001). In multivariable models, a history of homelessness was associated independently with current smoking [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.09; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.49-2.93], even after adjusting for age, sex, race, veteran status, insurance, education, employment, income, mental illness and alcohol and drug abuse. Housing status was not associated significantly with past-year desire to stop smoking in unadjusted (P=0.26) or adjusted (P=0.60) analyses; 84% of currently homeless, 89% of formerly homeless and 82% of never homeless smokers reported wanting to quit., CONCLUSIONS: Among patients of US health centers, a history of homelessness doubles the odds of being a current smoker independent of other socio-economic factors and behavioral health conditions. However, homeless smokers do not differ from non-homeless smokers in their desire to quit and should be offered effective interventions.Copyright © 2013 Society for the Study of Addiction.

T1  - Medicaid expansion initiative in Massachusetts: enrollment among substance-abusing homeless adults
A1  - Zur J.

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: We assessed whether homeless adults entering substance abuse treatment in Massachusetts were less likely than others to enroll in Medicaid after implementation of the MassHealth Medicaid expansion program in 1997., METHODS: We used interrupted time-series analysis in data on substance abuse treatment admissions from the Treatment 0Episode Data Set (1992-2009) to evaluate Medicaid coverage rates in Massachusetts and to identify whether trends differed between homeless and housed participants. We also compared Massachusetts data with data from 17 other states and the District of Columbia combined., RESULTS: The percentage of both homeless and housed people entering treatment with Medicaid increased approximately 21% after expansion (P = .01), with an average increase of 5.4% per year over 12 years (P = .01). The increase in coverage was specific to Massachusetts, providing evidence that the MassHealth policy was the cause of this increase., CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide evidence in favor of state participation in the Medicaid expansion in January 2014 under the Affordable Care Act and suggest that hard-to-reach vulnerable groups such as substance-abusing homeless adults are as likely as other population groups to benefit from this policy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Although participatory methods have become increasingly popular, people with lived experience of mental illness and homelessness have been historically excluded from service planning and research. To better plan for meaningful inclusion of consumers, this study examines lessons learned from the People with Lived Experience Caucus in the Toronto Site of the At Home/Chez Soi Research Demonstration Project on Homelessness and Mental Health., METHOD: The inclusion of the People with Lived Experience Caucus was evaluated using qualitative methods and multiple data sources, including review of 42 documents, 11 individual interviews, and three focus groups. Caucus members were included in the study team. Transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory methodology., RESULTS: Findings revealed a complex story of Caucus engagement: Facing time constraints and given little direction, the Caucus developed through a tumultuous process related to both internal and external barriers to meaningful inclusion. Despite the challenges, the Caucus contributed meaningfully to various aspects of the research demonstration project., CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It is possible to successfully integrate psychiatric consumers with experience of homelessness in many aspects of research and service planning. Suggestions for future initiatives hoping to engage consumers include: early involvement, purposeful selection of members, clear communication of roles and responsibilities, a consumer coordinating group, and space for critical dialog throughout the process. Lessons learned can inform the inclusion of consumers in similar endeavors in other jurisdictions.Copyright (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).

N2  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common among people with substance abuse histories and a burden for U.S. veterans in particular. This study compares self-reported HCV between 1,652 veterans and 48,013 nonveterans who received public-sector substance abuse treatment in Los Angeles between 2006 and 2010. A higher percentage of veterans than nonveterans reported HCV (6.5% vs. 3.8%, p < .0001). Homelessness and mental illness explained, respectively, 8.6% and 7.1% of the difference in HCV between the two groups, adjusting for other variables. Reducing homelessness and mental illness among veterans may also help reduce the excess burden of HCV in this population.

N2  - We reviewed the literature on standard case management (SCM), intensive case management (ICM), assertive community treatment (ACT), and critical time intervention (CTI) for homeless adults. We searched databases for peer-reviewed English articles published from 1985 to 2011 and found 21 randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies comparing case management to other services. We found little evidence for the effectiveness of ICM. SCM improved housing stability, reduced substance use, and removed employment barriers for substance users. ACT improved housing stability and was cost-effective for mentally ill and dually diagnosed persons. CTI showed promise for housing, psychopathology, and substance use and was cost-effective for mentally ill persons. More research is needed on how case management can most effectively support rapid-rehousing approaches to homelessness.

T1  - A strengths based method for homeless youth: effectiveness and fidelity of Houvast

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - While homelessness among youth is a serious problem, there is little information about evidence-based interventions for homeless youth. In cooperation with professionals and youths, Wolf (2012) developed Houvast (Dutch for 'grip'): a strengths based method grounded in scientific and practice evidence. The main aim of Houvast is to improve the quality of life of homeless youths by focusing on their strengths, thus stimulating their capacity for autonomy and self-reliance. The effectiveness and fidelity of Houvast will be tested in ten Dutch services for homeless youth which are randomly allocated to an intervention group (n = 5), or a control group which provides care as usual (n = 5). Measurements of both objective and subjective quality of life and secondary outcomes (mental and physical health, substance use, coping, resilience, psychological needs, care needs, working relationship with the professional and attainment of personal goals) will be conducted among homeless youths (n = 251). Youths in both groups will be interviewed by means of a structured interview at baseline, at time of ending care or after having received care for six months (T1) and at nine months after baseline (T2). Model fidelity will be tested around T1. This study is unique as it includes a large number of homeless youths who are followed for a period of nine months, and because it focuses on a strengths based approach. If the Houvast method proves to be effective in improving quality of life it will be the first evidence-based intervention for homeless youth. Netherlands Trail Register (NTR):NTR3254.

T1  - Change in Parent- and Child-Reported Internalizing and Externalizing Behaviors Among Substance Abusing Runaways: The Effects of Family and Individual Treatments

Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Shelter-recruited adolescents are known to have high rates of substance abuse and co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. Many studies have documented these mental health concerns, but only a small number of studies have tested interventions that may be useful for ameliorating these vulnerabilities. The current study compared three empirically supported psychotherapy interventions, Motivational Interviewing (MI), the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA), and Ecologically-Based Family Therapy (EBFT) with 179 substance abusing runaway adolescents (47 % female, 74 % minority) and their primary caretaker recruited through a Midwestern runaway crisis shelter. Examining both child and primary caretaker reports, each treatment was associated with significant reductions in internalizing and externalizing behaviors to 24 months post-baseline. However, the trajectory of change differed among the treatments. Adolescents receiving MI showed a quicker reduction in internalizing and externalizing behaviors but also a quicker increase in these behaviors compared to adolescents receiving EBFT, who continued to evidence improvements to 24 months. The findings provide support for continued evaluation of these treatments for use with this vulnerable population of adolescents. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - Housing instability, a growing public health problem, may be an independent environmental risk factor for hypertension, but limited prospective data exist. We sought to determine the independent association of housing instability in early adulthood (year 5, 1990-1991) and incident hypertension over the subsequent 15 years of follow-up (years 7, 10, 15, and 20) in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study (N=5,115). Because causes of inadequate housing and its effects on health are thought to vary by race and sex, we hypothesized that housing instability would exert a differential effect on incident hypertension by race and sex. At year 5, all CARDIA participants were asked about housing and those free of hypertension were analyzed (N=4,342). We defined housing instability as living in overcrowded housing, moving frequently, or living doubled up. Of the 4,342 participants, 8.5 % were living in unstable housing. Across all participants, housing instability was not associated with incident hypertension (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1.1; 95 % CI, 0.9-1.5) after adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic status, substance use, social factors, body mass index, and study site. However, the association varied by race and sex (p value for interaction, <0.001). Unstably housed white women had a hypertension incidence rate 4.7 times (IRR, 4.7; 95 % CI, 2.4-9.2) that of stably housed white women in adjusted analysis. There was no association among white men, black women, or black men. These findings suggest that housing instability may be a more important risk factor among white women, and may act independently or as a marker for other psychosocial stressors (e.g., stress from intimate partner violence) leading to development of hypertension. Studies that examine the role of these psychosocial stressors in development of hypertension risk among unstably housed white women are needed.

T1  - Enhanced nicotine self-administration in the neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion rat model of schizophrenia without nicotine reversal of spatial working memory deficits

N2  - Background: Greater than 80% of people suffering with schizophrenia also have nicotine dependence, representing a 4-fold increase in prevalence over the general population. Despite increased morbidity and mortality, psychiatric treatment noncompliance and financial destitution associated with smoking in schizophrenia, prevailing theories and clinical research efforts exploring this comorbidity have focused on the hypothesis that these patients smoke so much to receive beneficial-medicinal effects of nicotine, particularly for cognitive deficits in the disorder. We employed a widely studied animal model of schizophrenia neonatal ventral hippocampal lesions (NVHL) in rats to examine the extent to which this comorbidity may be better explained from an addiction vulnerability vs. self-medication framework. Method(s): In experiment 1, NVHL and SHAM-operated control rats (N=45) were compared in sensitization to nicotine (vs. saline injections) during adolescence (nicotine 0.5 mg/kg/day; Post-natal Days (PD35-44)) followed in adulthood (PD>60) by i.v. nicotine self-administration (0.015 mug/ injection; 2 h sessions) where the main effects of lesion status and adolescent nicotine history were assessed across acquisition, dose response testing and drug seeking during extinction. Experiment 2 used separate groups of NVHL vs. SHAM rats (N=37) to examine the effects of daily nicotine injections in adulthood (0.5 mg/kg/day; 30 minutes before behavioral testing) on spatial learning and memory as tested on the radial arm maze (RAM). Result(s): In experiment 1, although nicotine injections produced robust levels of behavioral sensitization during adolescence, NVHLs trended toward, but did not show significantly increased levels of sensitization compared to SHAMs, in contrast to prior findings where NVHL rats tested in adulthood show robustly increased nicotine sensitization compared to SHAMs. NVHL rats went on in adulthood to show significantly increased levels of nicotine self-administration during acquisition and over the entire course of i.v. nicotine exposure. Adolescent nicotine experience did not alter acquisition but changed the sensitivity to nicotine in the dose response testing, so that adolescent exposed rats consumed more nicotine at the highest dose self-administered. During extinction, NVHL rats demonstrated greater nicotinepaired lever responding. In experiment 2, deficits in RAM learning and memory due to NVHLs were not corrected by nicotine injections, and in fact, cessation of nicotine injections during RAM testing produced detrimental consequences for cognition in both NVHL and SHAM rats alike. Conclusion(s): In an extensively studied animal model of schizophrenia known for its utility in parsimoniously modeling core symptoms and many of the pharmacological, developmental, and neurobiological features of human schizophrenia, we observed an enhancement of the addictive properties of nicotine without evidence for nicotine-induced enhancement in cognition. These findings call into question the validity of selfmedication-based explanations for smoking in schizophrenia. A deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms that may drive nicotine addiction vulnerability in schizophrenia as illuminated by novel animal modeling and clinical approaches are needed to define more effective preventative and treatment strategies for nicotine addiction comorbidity beyond what can be achieved based on traditionally-held claims that nicotine is therapeutic for schizophrenia.

N2  - Purpose: We evaluate the efficacy of a short family intervention in reducing sexual risk behavior, drug use, and delinquent behaviors among homeless youth. Method(s): A randomized controlled trial of 151 families with a homeless adolescent aged 12 to 17 years. Between March 2006 and June 2009, adolescents were recruited from diverse sites in Southern California and were assessed at recruitment (baseline), and at 3, 6, and 12 months later. Families were randomly assigned to an intervention condition with five weekly home-based intervention sessions or a control condition (standard care). Main outcome measures reflect self-reported sexual risk behavior, substance use, and delinquent behaviors over the past 90 days. Result(s): Sexual risk behavior (e.g., mean number of partners; p <.001), alcohol use (p =.003), hard drug use (p <.001), and delinquent behaviors (p =.001) decreased significantly more during 12 months in the intervention condition compared with the control condition. Marijuana use, however, significantly increased in the intervention condition compared with the control condition (p <.001). Conclusion(s): An intervention to reengage families of homeless youth has significant benefits in reducing risk over 12 months. © 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

N2  - Background: Unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are important and costly public health problems in the United States resulting from unprotected sexual intercourse. Risk factors for unplanned pregnancies and STIs (poverty, low educational attainment, homelessness, substance abuse, lack of health insurance, history of an abusive environment, and practice of commercial sex work) are especially high among women with a history of incarceration. Project CARE (Contraceptive Awareness and Reproductive Education) is designed to evaluate an innovative intervention, Motivational Interviewing with Computer Assistance (MICA), aimed at enhancing contraceptive initiation and maintenance among incarcerated women who do not want a pregnancy within the next year and who are anticipated to be released back to the community. This study aims to: (1) increase the initiation of highly effective contraceptives while incarcerated; (2) increase the continuation of highly effective contraceptive use at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after release; and (3) decrease unsafe sexual activity.Methods/Design: This randomized controlled trial will recruit 400 women from the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RI DOC) women's jail at risk for an unplanned pregnancy (that is, sexually active with men and not planning/wanting to become pregnant in the next year). They will be randomized to two interventions: a control group who receive two educational videos (on contraception, STIs, and pre-conception counseling) or a treatment group who receive two sessions of personalized MICA. MICA is based on the principles of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) and on Motivational Interviewing (MI), an empirically supported counseling technique designed to enhance readiness to change targeted behaviors. Women will be followed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post release and assessed for STIs, pregnancy, and reported condom use. Discussion(s): Results from this study are expected to enhance our understanding of the efficacy of MICA to enhance contraceptive initiation and maintenance and reduce sexual risk-taking behaviors among incarcerated women who have re-entered the community.Trial registration: NCT01132950. © 2012 Clarke et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

T1  - Exploring the role of the internet in juvenile prostitution cases coming to the attention of law enforcement

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - This exploratory analysis examines the role of the Internet in juvenile prostitution cases coming to the attention of law enforcement. The National Juvenile Prostitution Study (N-JPS) collected information from a national sample of law enforcement agencies about the characteristics of juvenile prostitution cases. In comparison to non-Internet juvenile prostitution cases, Internet juvenile prostitution cases involved younger juveniles and police were more likely to treat juveniles as victims rather than offenders. In addition, these cases were significantly more likely to involve a family or acquaintance exploiter. This analysis suggests that the role of the Internet may impact legal and social service response to juveniles involved in prostitution. In addition, it highlights the need for interventions that acknowledge the vulnerabilities of youth involved in this type of commercial sexual exploitation.

T1  - Benefits of Extra Begging Fail to Compensate for Immunological Costs in Southern Shrike (Lanius meridionalis) Nestlings
A1  - Moreno-Rueda G.
A1  - Redondo T. 
Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Theoretical models aimed at explaining the evolution of honest, informative begging signals employed by nestling birds to solicit food from their parents, require that dishonest signalers incur a net viability cost in order to prevent runaway escalation of signal intensity over evolutionary time. Previous attempts to determine such a cost empirically have identified two candidate physiological costs associated with exaggerated begging: a growth and an immunological cost. However, they failed to take into account the fact that those costs are potentially offset by the fact that nestlings that invest more in begging are also likely to obtain more food. In this study, we test experimentally whether a 25% increase in ingested food compensates for growth and immunological costs of extra begging in southern shrike (Lanius meridionalis) nestlings. Three nestmates matched by size were given three treatments: low begging, high begging-same food intake, and high begging-extra food intake. We found that, while a higher food intake did effectively compensate for the growth cost, it failed to compensate for the immunological cost, measured as T-cell mediated immune response against an innocuous mitogen. Thus, we show for the first time that escalated begging has an associated physiological net cost likely to affect nestling survival negatively. © 2012 Moreno-Rueda, Redondo.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Mobile digital chest radiography (CXR) is used routinely to screen for pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in London among homeless populations, persons accessing drug treatment services and prisoners. OBJECTIVE(S): 1) To establish the sensitivity and specificity of mobile digital CXR, and 2) to test the hypothesis that actively identified cases have reduced odds of sputum smear positivity vs. those presenting passively to health care services from the same populations. METHOD(S): Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using a gold standard comparator of culture-confirmed cases of PTB reported to the national surveillance system within 90 days of screening. Logistic regression was used to determine whether actively detected cases had reduced odds of smear positivity compared to passively detected cases after adjustment for confounding. RESULT(S): The intervention had a sensitivity of 81.8% (95%CI 64.5-93.0) and a specificity of 99.2% (95%CI 99.1-99.3). After adjusting for confounding, there was evidence that cases identified through screening were less likely to be smear-positive than passively identified cases (OR 0.34, 95%CI 0.14-0.85; likelihood ratio test P = 0.022). CONCLUSION(S): Digital CXR achieves a high level of sensitivity and specificity in an operational setting; targeted mobile radiographic screening can reduce the risk of onward transmission by identifying cases before they become infectious. © 2012 The Union.

N2  - Rates of HIV/AIDS and depression in women are significant public health concerns. The current meta-analysis tested the hypothesis that depression levels moderate change in sexual risk behavior in women participating in HIV prevention interventions. Features of the interventions were also explored as possible factors in decreasing levels of depression and sexual risk behavior. Included were HIV primary prevention interventions that measured sexual risk behavior and depression at baseline and follow-up and reported separate results for women. Ten studies (fourteen intervention groups and ten control groups; N = 4,195 women) met the inclusion criteria. The majority of participants were African American; mean age was 28-years old. Both depression and sexual risk behavior decreased significantly in treatment and control groups from baseline to follow-up. Sexual risk decreased more to the extent that interventions sampled (a) participants with higher baseline levels of depression, (b) older women, (c) Hispanics/Latinas, and/or (d) members of risk groups (e.g., drug users, homeless). Interventions that included (e) condom provision, (f) information about condoms, and/or (g) HIV counseling and testing were also more successful in decreasing sexual risk. Finally (h), interventions were more likely to reduce sexual risk behavior when they decreased depression to a large extent relative to baseline levels. Interventions were more likely to decrease depression when they (a) had samples of only women, (b) targeted risk groups, and/or (c) provided self-management and coping skills. Reducing depression appears to play a role in decreasing sexual risk behavior, suggesting that interventions should actively address depression. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Patient adherence to medications, particularly for conditions requiring prolonged treatment such as tuberculosis, is frequently less than ideal, and can result in poor treatment outcomes. Material incentives (given as cash, vouchers and tokens), have been used to improve adherence. To assess the effects of material incentives in people undergoing diagnostic testing, or receiving prophylactic or curative therapy, for tuberculosis. We undertook a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; Science Citation Index; and reference lists of relevant publications; to 22 June 2011. Randomized controlled trials of material incentives in patients being investigated for tuberculosis, or on treatment for latent or active disease. At least two authors independently screened and selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. The effects of interventions are compared using risk ratios (RR), and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. We identified 11 eligible studies. Ten were conducted in the USA: in adolescents (one trial), in injection drug or cocaine users (four trials), in homeless adults (three trials), and in prisoners (two trials). One additional trial recruited malnourished men receiving active treatment for tuberculosis in Timor-Leste.Material incentives may increase the return rate for reading of tuberculin skin test results compared to normal care (two trials, 1371 participants: RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.29, low quality evidence).Similarly, incentives probably improve clinic re-attendance for initiation or continuation of antituberculosis prophylaxis (three trials, 595 participants: RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.96, moderate quality evidence), and may improve subsequent completion of prophylaxis in some settings (three trials, 869 participants: RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 4.58, low quality evidence).We currently don't know if incentives can improve long-term adherence and completion of antituberculosis treatment for active disease. Only one trial has assessed this and the incentive, given as a daily hot meal, was not well received by the population due to the inconvenience of attending the clinic at midday (one trial, 265 participants, RR 0.98, 95%CI 0.86 to 1.12, very low quality evidence).Several trials have compared different forms or levels of incentive. These comparisons remain limited to single trials and robust conclusions cannot be made. In summary, cash incentives may be more effective than non-cash incentives (return for test results: one trial, 651 participants: RR 1.13, 95%CI 1.07 to 1.19, low quality evidence, adherence to tuberculosis prophylaxis: one trial, 141 participants: RR 1.26, 95%CI 1.02 to 1.56, low quality evidence) and higher amounts of cash may be more effective than lower amounts (return for test results: one trial, 404 participants: RR 1.08, 95%CI 1.01 to 1.16, low quality evidence).Material incentives may also be more effective than motivational education at improving return for tuberculin skin test results (low quality evidence), but may be no more effective than peer counselling, or structured education at improving continuation or completion of prophylaxis (low quality evidence). There is limited evidence to support the use of material incentives to improve return rates for tuberculosis diagnostic test results and adherence to antituberculosis preventive therapy. The data are currently limited to trials among predominantly male drug users, homeless, and prisoner subpopulations in the USA, and therefore the results are not easily generalised to the wider adult population, or to low- and middle-income countries, where the tuberculosis burden is highest.Further high-quality studies are needed to assess both the costs and effectiveness of incentives to improve adherence to long-term treatment of tuberculosis.

N2  - Advocates, clinicians, policy makers, and survivors frequently cite intimate partner violence (IPV) as an immediate cause of or precursor to housing problems. Research has indicated an association between homelessness and IPV, yet few studies examine IPV and housing instability. Housing instability differs from homelessness, in that someone experiencing housing instability may currently have a place to live but faces difficulties with maintaining the residence. We present baseline findings from a longitudinal cohort study of 278 female IPV survivors with housing as a primary concern. Our analysis indicates the greater the number of housing instability risk factors (e.g., eviction notice, problems with landlord, moving multiple times), the more likely the abused woman reported symptoms consistent with PTSD (p <.001), depression (p <.001), reduced quality of life (p <.001), increased work/school absence (OR = 1.28, p <.004), and increased hospital/emergency department use (OR = 1.22, p <.001). These outcomes persist even when controlling for the level of danger in the abusive relationship and for survivors' drug and alcohol use. Importantly, both housing instability and danger level had stronger associations with negative health outcomes than other factors such as age, alcohol, and drug use; both make unique contributions to negative health outcomes and could contribute in different ways. Housing instability is an important and understudied social determinant of health for IPV survivors. These findings begin to address the literature gap on the relationship between housing instability, IPV, and survivors' health, employment, and utilization of medical care services. © The Author(s) 2012.

N2  - To describe and compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among homeless persons with a general population sample in Stockholm County, 2006, and to analyse the importance of certain social determinants of health among the homeless. Face-to-face interviews with 155 homeless persons and a postal survey to a general population sample, mainly based on the same questionnaire, including questions on social determinants of health and HRQoL measured with the EQ-5D. Chronic illness was three times more common among the homeless. HRQoL was worse among homeless persons than in the general population sample: the homeless reported more problems, especially more severe problems, in all the EQ-5D dimensions and had considerably lower EQ-5D(index) and EQ(VAS) score than the general population. Most problems were reported in the dimension anxiety/depression. Among the homeless, longer duration and more severe degree of homelessness lowered HRQoL, but few determinants were statistically significantly related to HRQoL. Having mental disease significantly lowered HRQoL. This study was an attempt to include hard-to-reach groups in an assessment of population health. Homeless persons had considerably worse HRQoL than the general population and reported most problems in the dimension anxiety/depression. Some diseases may contribute to causing homelessness; others may be seen as consequences. Homeless persons are a vulnerable group in society. Further interview studies are needed based on larger sample of homeless persons to explore health determinants such as sex, age, socioeconomic factors, duration and degree of homelessness, and health-related behaviours among the homeless persons.

N2  - Context and objective: Children and adolescents who live in situations of social vulnerability present a series of health problems. Nonetheless, affirmations that sensory and cognitive abnormalities are present are a matter of controversy. The aim of this study was to investigate aspects to auditory processing, through applying the brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) and behavioral auditory processing tests to children living on the streets, and comparison with a control group. Design and setting: Cross-sectional study in the Laboratory of Auditory Processing, School of Medicine, Universidade de Sao Paulo. Method(s): The auditory processing tests were applied to a group of 27 individuals, subdivided into 11 children (7 to 10 years old) and 16 adolescents (11 to 16 years old), of both sexes, in situations of social vulnerability, compared with an age-matched control group of 10 children and 11 adolescents without complaints. The BAEP test was also applied to investigate the integrity of the auditory pathway. RESULT(S): For both children and adolescents, there were significant differences between the study and control groups in most of the tests applied, with significantly worse performance in the study group, except in the pediatric speech intelligibility test. Only one child had an abnormal result in the BAEP test. Conclusion(s): The results showed that the study group (children and adolescents) presented poor performance in the behavioral auditory processing tests, despite their unaltered auditory brainstem pathways, as shown by their normal results in the BAEP test.

N2  - Molecular genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has proved to be a powerful tool in tuberculosis surveillance, epidemiology, and control. Based on results obtained through 15 years of nationwide IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) genotyping of M. tuberculosis cases in Denmark, a country on the way toward tuberculosis elimination, we discuss M. tuberculosis transmission dynamics and point to areas for control interventions. Cases with 100% identical genotypes (RFLP patterns) were defined as clustered, and a cluster was defined as cases with an identical genotype. Of 4,601 included cases, corresponding to 76% of reported and 97% of culture-verified tuberculosis cases in the country, 56% were clustered, of which 69% were Danes. Generally, Danes were more often in large clusters (>=50 persons), older (mean age, 45 years), and male (male/female ratio, 2.5). Also, Danes had a higher cluster frequency within a 2-year observation window (60.8%), and higher clustering rate of new patterns over time, compared to immigrants. A dominant genotype, cluster 2, constituted 44% of all clustered and 35% of all genotyped cases. This cluster was primarily found among Danish males, 30 to 59 years of age, often socially marginalized, and with records of alcohol abuse. In Danes, cluster 2 alone was responsible for the high cluster frequency level. Immigrants had a higher incidence of clustered tuberculosis at a younger age (0 to 39 years). To achieve tuberculosis elimination in Denmark, high-risk transmission environments, like the cluster 2 enviornment in Danes, and specific transmission chains in immigrants in the capital area, e.g., homeless/socially marginalized Somalis/Greenlanders, often with alcohol abuse, must be targeted, including groups with a high risk of reactivation.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - The paper presents findings from a longitudinal study identifying different classes of homeless individuals in a mid-size Canadian city based on health-related characteristics and comparing the housing trajectories of these classes 2 years later. Using data collected through in-person interviews with a sample of 329 single persons who have experienced homelessness, the paper presents results of a latent class analysis. Results found four distinct latent classes characterized by different levels of severity of health problems-i. e., a class of individuals who are "Higher Functioning" (28.7%), a second class with "Substance Abuse Problems" (27.1%), a third class with "Mental Health Substance Abuse Problems" (22.6%), and a fourth class with "Complex Physical and Mental Health Problems" (21.6%) that included having diminished physical functioning, multiple chronic physical health conditions, mental health difficulties, and in some cases substance abuse problems. Follow-up interviews with 197 of these individuals (59.9%) 2 years later showed the class of individuals with substance abuse problems experiencing the greatest difficulty in exiting homelessness and achieving housing stability. Implications of these findings for social policy development and program planning are discussed. © 2011 Society for Community Research and Action.

N2  - Review of routinely collected tuberculosis genotyping results following a known outbreak is a potential mechanism to examine the effectiveness of outbreak control measures. To assess differences in characteristics between outbreak and postoutbreak tuberculosis cases. Retrospective. United States. All tuberculosis cases identified as a result of >5-person outbreaks investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during 2003 to 2007 (original outbreak cases), and subsequent culture-positive tuberculosis cases with matching Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypes reported in the same county during 2004 to 2008 (postoutbreak cases). Proportion of demographic, social, and clinical characteristics of tuberculosis outbreak cases compared to postoutbreak cases. SECONDARY: Proportion of demographic, social, and clinical characteristics of epidemiologically linked versus nonlinked cases. Six outbreaks with 111 outbreak cases and 110 postoutbreak cases were identified. Differences between outbreak and postoutbreak cases were gender (69% vs 85% male; P < .01), birth origin (3% vs 11% foreign-born; P = .02), disease severity (48% vs 62% sputum smear-positive; P = .04), homelessness (38% vs 51%; P = .05), and injection drug use (4% vs 11%; P = .04). For 5 of the 6 outbreaks, the status of epidemiologic relationships among postoutbreak cases was available (n = 89). The postoutbreak cases with a known epidemiologic link to the original outbreak were in younger persons (aged 39 vs 47 years; P < .01), and a larger proportion reported injection drug use (18% vs 4%; P = .04) or noninjection drug use (44% vs 18%; P < .01) than those without a reported link. Health jurisdictions can utilize genotyping data to monitor and define the characteristics of postoutbreak cases related to the original outbreak.

N2  - The important increase in immigration during recent years has changed the epidemiology and control strategies for tuberculosis (TB) in many places. This study evaluates the effectiveness of intervention with community health workers (CHW) to improve contact tracing among immigrants. The study included all TB cases detected by the Barcelona TB Program from 2000 to 2005 and compared a period without CHW intervention (2000-2002) to a period with CHW intervention (2003-2005). The influence on contact tracing of sex, age, hospital of diagnosis, district of residence, birthplace, HIV, homeless and CHW intervention was analysed by logistic regression. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. 960 foreign born TB cases were detected, 388 in the intervention period. Contact tracing was performed on 65,7% of 201 smear-positive cases during the pre-intervention period compared to 81.6% of 152 smear-positive TB cases during the intervention period (p < 0.001). Risk factors associated with incomplete contact tracing of smear-positive index cases included being diagnosed in two hospitals without contact tracing TB unit (OR = 3.5; CI:1.4-8.9) and (OR = 4.6; CI:1.6-13.5) respectively, birth place in India-Pakistan (OR = 4.4; CI:1.9-10.3) or North Africa (OR = 4.3; CI:1.8-10.5), having an unknown residence (OR = 5.4; CI:1.6-18.0), being HIV-infected (OR = 6.1; CI:2.5-14.8) or homeless (OR = 3.3; CI:1.3-8.2), and the absence of CHW intervention (OR = 2.4; CI:1.3-4.3). The effectiveness of contact tracing for TB control in areas with high immigration can be improved by incorporating CHWs who act as translators, cultural mediators and facilitators who accompany cases and contacts through treatment and follow-up.

N2  - Introduction : No study explores the impact of housing and AIDS in Quebec. This project raises a strategy of partnership between HIV/ AIDS community-based organizations (CBOs) and researchers actively engaged in the fight against AIDS, as well as in the supportive housing of the poorest people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), such as sex workers, drug users, persons affected by mental health problems, homeless youth and women, immigrants. Ten CBOs members of the provincial Coalition of community groups (COCQ-AIDS) have define a project on the issue. How will a collective reflexive practice with community-based organizations and researchers help to innovate a field of research about housing and AIDS in Quebec that values the multiples voices of engaged community actors? Methodology : The project has begun with an experimental catalyst project with two of the Coalition members. The objectives are (a) to collect their expertise accumulated on supportive housing with the poorest sectors and (b) to document the community practices through the viewpoints of all the actors involved. We experiment with a form of the community-based research with the direct involvement of the participants. We engage PLWHA as peer research assistants from the poorest and most marginalized populations linked to the organizations. They choose the popular education methods with which they feel most comfortable (posters as peer productions, storytelling, photographs and illustrations). Conclusions : The ethnological approach increases the understanding of the living milieu where they are inserted. One defining trait of Quebec governance is the participation of civil society organizations in the fabric of public health and social policies. Volunteering in Quebec is historically based on a model of collective responsibility that is quite different from the individual philanthropy prevalent in English Canada. The HIV/AIDS supportive housing in Quebec established some community-based evidences about housing as a response to the social determinants of health for the PLWHA from the poorest sectors.

N2  - Background: Lice are frequently seen in pediatrics with approximately 6 million cases diagnosed yearly in the United States. Anemia presents at different degrees because each louse survives by feeding on human blood. It has been demonstrated in past studies the exact amount of blood extracted by each louse with each feeding. An adult female louse feeds 0.1579 mL of blood with each feed and an adult male louse feeds 0.0657 ml with each feed. If each person has 2000 lice then in one day 1.89 mL of blood is extracted. If lice infestations go untreated for 1 month then 56.7mL of blood are extracted. Objective(s): To investigate the possible association between iron deficiency anemia and lice infestation in a pediatric patient. Design/Method: Case Report Results: A 4 year old female presented with fevers up to 103 for 2 days and seizures. Labs revealed a white blood cell count 4700/mL, hemoglobin 4.8 g/dL, platelet count 93,000/mL, MCV 49.7fL, ferritin 19 ng/mL, RDW 24.8%, reticulocyte percent of 1.4, ESR 36 mm/hr, protein 7.9 g/dL, and albumin 3.7 g/dL. CT scan of the brain, lumbar puncture, and bone marrow aspiration were negative, while a urine culture was positive for urinary tract infection. No evidence for failure to thrive was found on evaluation. Importantly, the patient and family were discovered to have severe untreated lice infestation. On examination, patient had visible lice in her hair and dispersed throughout her body necessitating 4 treatments with permethrin during her hospital stay to eradicate. Conclusion(s): Conclusion(s): Lice infestation can cause iron deficiency anemia in children if it is prolonged and goes untreated. We concluded after an exhaustive evaluation that this patient's anemia was caused by chronic lice infestation. Her anemia resolved over a period of 3 months after treatment for lice and supplementation with iron. Data on this topic is mostly found in animal studies; however there are case reports in adults, particularly homeless individuals.

N2  - Background: Ugandan guidelines recommend 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for HIV-infected women with continued breastfeeding (BF) for at least 1 year. Food insecurity has been posited to be a barrier to adherence to infant feeding recommendations. We therefore explored if greater food insecurity was associated with suboptimal breastfeeding (BF) practices. Method(s): Data on food insecurity and BF practices and beliefs were collected among HIV-infected pregnant and BF women on antiretroviral therapy (ART) participating in the PROMOTE trial (NCT00993031) in Tororo, Uganda. Food insecurity was assessed using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS). BF practices were determined using monthly maternal reports from a prospective cohort of 143 PROMOTE infants born between March 6, 2010 and October 9, 2011. Beliefs about food insecurity and BF were assessed using a purposive sample of 32 BF PROMOTE subjects who participated in in-depth interviews (IDIs) in July and August 2011. Result(s): Food insecurity was very high; 82.5% were from severely, 14.7% moderately, and 2.1% mildly food insecure households. Median (inter-quartile range) HFIAS score was 17 (12-22). The prevalence of EBF was 89.5% and 66.9% at 3 and 6 months respectively; the prevalence of BF at 12 months was 84.1%. In multivariate logistic regression adjusting for socio-demographics and HIV-stage, the odds (95% confidence interval) of EBF at 6 months was 0.16 (0.03-0.86) for women in severely food insecure households compared to those in non-severely food insecure households. Consistent with this, IDIs revealed that BF participants associated insufficient nutritional intake with difficulties adhering to infant feeding recommendations: 75.0% were concerned about adequate breast milk production and 46.9% reported experiencing problems while EBF, e.g. unsatisfied baby. Conclusion(s): Severe food insecurity is associated with suboptimal EBF. The mitigation of food insecurity may increase the duration of EBF among HIV+ women in rural Uganda.

N2  - Purpose: Adolescents often present to the hospital as a consequence of risk behaviors. A significant proportion of adolescents with chronic illnesses are at higher risk for mental health co-morbidities and risk behavior. There has been little research into health risk screening performed in hospitals. Resident staff is responsible for health risk screening but often don't complete it and other avenues need to be explored. 1. To develop guidelines for the implementation of the ASQ as standard of practice at BC Children's Hospital (BCCH). 2. To further modify the ASQ to address the specific needs of the youth at BCCH. 3. To increase the competence of health care providers at BCCH by clarifying referrals following use of the ASQ. Method(s): The Australian version of the ASQ was modified to fit with local Canadian culture. Questions on cyber-bullying, transition, witnessing violence and homelessness were added. The target population was 14-18 year old youth admitted to an Acute Pediatric Ward at BCCH. A retrospective chart review was first completed on 15 youth prior to the piloting of the ASQ. Then, the ASQ was completed by another 15 youth admitted to BCCH. After reviewing the ASQ, the need for a referral to Adolescent Medicine, Psychiatry, Social Work and /or Psychology was assessed. If required, the treating team was notified. Data from the retrospective chart review included: 1. Demographics 2. Discharge diagnosis. 3. Documentation of a psychosocial assessment 4. Referrals made during the admission to the above services. This was compared to data from the completed ASQ, which included all of the above, as well as: 1. Information from the ASQ. 2. Referrals as a result of the completed ASQ. 3. Time to complete the ASQ. 4. Feedback about the ASQ. The data was entered and analyzed using Excel. Result(s): In the first group, the male:female ratio was 7:8 and 40% were 15yrs old. In the ASQ group, the male:female ratio was 8:7 and 53% were 15yrs of age. In retrospective chart review, 14 out of 30 patients had a psychosocial assessment. The average time to complete the ASQ was 10 minutes. In the ASQ group, six patients were referred to Psychology, Psychiatry or Adolescent Medicine, three of which resulted from their questionnaire responses. Responses to questions added to this version drew unexpected positives on cyberbullying and witnessing violence. Most of the youth did know their family doctor but were not ready for transition. Conclusion(s): The modified ASQ in general was acceptable and understandable by the youth at BCCH. Based on the responses, we removed questions on homelessness, cultural background and modified questions on college/university. It was difficult to quantify the impact of the ASQ on clinical care given the small numbers and it was not the main aim of this pilot. Future directions would include trialing the ASQ on other wards and making it more interactive by comparing a pen and paper version with an iPad version.

T1  - Intervention for homeless, substance abusing mothers: Findings from a non-randomized pilot
A1  - Slesnick N.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Little empirically-based information is available regarding how best to intervene with substance-abusing homeless mothers. This study pilot-tested a comprehensive intervention with 15 homeless women and their 2- to 6-year-old children, recruited from a local family shelter. All participants were offered integrated intervention with three major components. The first component was housing which included 3 months of rental and utility assistance, and these services were not contingent upon women's abstinence from drugs or alcohol. The second and third components included 6 months of case management services and an evidence-based substance abuse treatment (Community Reinforcement Approach; CRA). Analysis revealed that women showed reductions in substance use (F 2,22 = 3.63; p <.05), homelessness (F2,24 = 25.31; p <.001), and mental health problems (F2,20 = 8.5; p <.01). Further, women reported reduced internalizing (F2,22 = 4.08; p <.05) and externalizing problems (F2,24 = 7.7; p =.01) among their children. The findings suggest that the intervention is a promising approach to meet the multiple needs of this vulnerable population. These positive outcomes support the need for future research to replicate the findings with a larger sample using a randomized design.

T1  - Demographic and substance abuse trends among pregnant and non-pregnant women: eleven years of treatment admission data
A1  - McCabe J.E.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - The objective of this study was to identify demographic and substance abuse trends among pregnant women entering treatment over eleven years. This study compiled the publicly available Treatment Episode Datasets from the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration from 1998 to 2008. Subjects included 1,724,479 women entering publicly funded substance abuse treatment for the first time, 81,818 of whom were pregnant. Compared to non-pregnant women, pregnant women were more likely to be younger, minority, never married, less educated, homeless, and on public-assistance or have no income. Referrals from health care providers (HCPs) among pregnant women entering treatment have stayed consistently low while referrals from the criminal justice system accounted for the largest portion of pregnant women entering treatment. Over the past eleven years, there has been a general decline in alcohol abuse and an increase in drug abuse among women entering treatment; this trend was more pronounced in pregnant women. Unlike their non-pregnant counterparts, pregnant women were more likely to report marijuana, not alcohol, as their primary problem substance as well as other drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine. Over the past eleven years, trends in the demographics and patterns of substance abuse among women have changed; some of these trends were unique to pregnant women. A large proportion of pregnant women entering treatment are referred by the criminal justice system. Knowledge surrounding the demographics and abuse patterns of pregnant women entering treatment can inform HCPs and community programs in their screening and outreach efforts.

T1  - Homelessness among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth: Implications for subsequent internalizing and externalizing symptoms
A1  - Rosario M.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Although lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth with a history of homelessness (running away or being evicted from their homes by parents) report more psychological symptoms than homeless heterosexual peers, it is unclear whether symptoms are due to homelessness, given the absence of a non-homeless comparison group. This study longitudinally investigates whether LGB youth with a history of homelessness report more subsequent psychological symptoms than non-homeless LGB youth and examines potential mediators of any such relationships. Of the 156 LGB youth interviewed (49% female; 78% non-White), 48% reported past homeless experiences. Homelessness was associated with subsequent symptoms of anxiety, depression, conduct problems, and substance abuse and to changes in symptoms over time even after controlling for childhood sexual abuse and early development of sexual orientation. Stressful life events, negative social relationships, and social support from friends mediated the relationships between homelessness and symptomatology. These findings suggest the need for interventions to reduce stress and enhance social support among LGB youth with a history of homelessness in order to reduce psychological symptoms. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between cumulative social adversity and childhood obesity among preschool-aged children (N = 1605) in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. METHOD(S): Maternal reports of intimate partner violence, food insecurity, housing insecurity, maternal depressive symptoms, maternal substance use, and father's incarceration were obtained when the child was 1 and 3 years of age. Two cumulative social risk scores were created by summing the 6 factors assessed at ages 1 and 3 years. Child height and weight were measured at 5 years of age. Logistic regression models stratified according to gender were used to estimate the association between cumulative social risk and obesity, adjusting for sociodemographic factors. RESULT(S): Seventeen percent of children were obese at age 5 years, and 57% had at least 1 social risk factor. Adjusting for sociodemographic factors, girls experiencing high cumulative social risk (>=2 factors) at age 1 year only (odds ratio [OR]: 2.1 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-4.1]) or at 3 years only (OR: 2.2 [95% CI: 1.2-4.2]) were at increased odds of being obese compared with girls with no risk factors at either time point. Those experiencing high cumulative risk at age 1 and 3 years were not at statistically significant odds of being obese (OR: 1.9 [95% CI: 0.9-4.0]). No significant associations were noted among boys. CONCLUSION(S): There seems to be gender differences in the effects of cumulative social risk factors on the prevalence of obesity at 5 years of age. Understanding the social context of families could make for more effective preventive efforts to combat childhood obesity. Copyright © 2012 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Self-harm is a common reason for Emergency Department (ED) attendance. We aimed to develop a clinical tool to help identify patients at higher risk of repeat self-harm, or suicide, within 6 months of an ED self-harm presentation., METHOD: The tool, the ReACT Self-Harm Rule, was derived using multicentre data from a prospective cohort study. Binary recursive partitioning was applied to data from two centres, and data from a separate centre were used to test the tool. There were 29 571 self-harm presentations to five hospital EDs between January 2003 and June 2007, involving 18 680 adults aged 16 years. We estimated sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values to measure the performance of the tool., RESULTS: A self-harm presentation was classified as higher risk if at least one of the following factors was present: recent self-harm (in the past year), living alone or homelessness, cutting as a method of harm and treatment for a current psychiatric disorder. The rule performed with 95% sensitivity [95% confidence interval (CI) 94-95] and 21% specificity (95% CI 21-22), and had a positive predictive value of 30% (95% CI 30-31) and a negative predictive value of 91% (95% CI 90-92) in the derivation centres; it identified 83/92 of all subsequent suicides., CONCLUSIONS: The ReACT Self-Harm Rule might be used as a screening tool to inform the process of assessing self-harm presentations to ED. The four risk factors could also be used as an adjunct to in-depth psychosocial assessment to help guide risk formulation. The use of multicentre data helped to maximize the generalizability of the tool, but we need to further verify its external validity in other localities.

N2  - Objective: Understanding factors associated with heavy drinking among homeless youth is important for prevention efforts. Social networks are associated with drinking among homeless youth, and studies have called for attention to racial differences in networks that may affect drinking behavior. This study investigates differences in network characteristics by the racial background of homeless youth, and associations of network characteristics with heavy drinking. (Heavy drinking was defined as having five or more drinks of alcohol in a row within a couple of hours on at least one day within the past 30 days.) Method: A probability sample of 235 Black and White homeless youths ages 13-24 were interviewed in Los Angeles County. We used chi-square or one-way analysis of variance tests to examine network differences by race and logistic regressions to identify network correlates of heavy drinking among Black and White homeless youth. Result(s): The networks of Black youth included significantly more relatives and students who attend school regularly, whereas the networks of White youth were more likely to include homeless persons, relatives who drink to intoxication, and peers who drink to intoxication. Having peers who drink heavily was significantly associated with heavy drinking only among White youth. For all homeless youth, having more students in the network who regularly attend school was associated with less risk of heavy drinking. Conclusion(s): This study is the first to our knowledge to investigate racial differences in network characteristics and associations of network char- acteristics with heavy drinking among homeless youth. White homeless youth may benefit from interventions that reduce their ties with peers who drink. Enhancing ties to school-involved peers may be a promising intervention focus for both Black and White homeless youth.

T1  - Comparisons of substance abuse, high-risk sexual behavior and depressive symptoms among homeless youth with and without a history of foster care placement

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - Aims and objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare prevalence of substance use, high-risk sexual behaviors, and depression symptoms between homeless youth with and without a history of foster care placement. Background(s): Approximately 26,000 young persons exit foster care annually in the United States. Once they 'age out' of foster care, however, many young persons do not have access to comprehensive health care. They also are at risk for substance abuse, homelessness, or mental illness. Because persons with a history of foster care are at risk for negative psycho-social outcomes, it is unclear if these young people might be different than homeless youth without this history. Design(s): The design is descriptive and cross-sectional. Method(s): A total of 156 homeless young persons, of whom 44 had a history of foster care placement, were recruited from a drop-in center that caters to homeless youth and young adults. Result(s): The sample was majority male and white; ages were 16-25. Significantly higher proportion of homeless former foster youth used methamphetamine within the last six months compared to non-fostered homeless youth p = 0.03). Homeless former foster youth were significantly older (p = 0.02) and less educated (p = 0.02) than their homeless counterparts without a history of foster care placement. Prevalence of using tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, crack cocaine, and powder cocaine were similar for both groups. Although not significant, a higher proportion of homeless former foster youth reported trading sex for money or drugs compared to non-fostered, homeless youth (19% versus 12% [trading sex for money], and 26% versus 14% [trading sex for drugs], respectively. Conclusion(s): Findings from this study show that, in general, homelessness is a negative outcome, irrespective of having a foster care history. However, those with that history need continued support when transitioning to independent living, such as access to health care, and encouragement to further their education. Relevance to clinical practice: It is important that nurses, who serve homeless youth populations, conduct a risk assessment profile, in order to ascertain a history of foster care placement, link former foster youth to social service agencies that provide risk reduction/health promotion education, and advocate for stable housing. © e Content Management Pty Ltd.

N2  - We described the distribution of risk factors for cardiovascular disease among homeless people living in the city of Porto, Portugal. Comparisons were made between subsamples of homeless people recruited in different settings and between the overall homeless sample group and a sample of the general population. All "houseless" individuals attending one of two homeless hostels or two institutions providing meal programs on specific days were invited to participate and were matched with subjects from the general population. We estimated sex, age and educationadjusted prevalence ratios or mean differences. The prevalence of previous illicit drug consumption and imprisonment was almost twice as high among the homeless from institutions providing meal programs. This group also showed lower mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Prevalence of smoking was almost 50% higher in the overall homeless group. Mean body mass index and waist circumference were also lower in the homeless group and its members were almost five times less likely to report dyslipidemia. Our findings contribute to defining priorities for interventions directed at this segment of society and to reducing inequalities in this extremely underprivileged population.

T1  - Comparing health conditions of homeless clients in budapest day-care centres
A1  - Kovacs A.

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Aim. Diotores Foundation has carried out a complex health condition study among 100 volunteering homeless people - part of the program supported by The Norwegian Found - which aimed at getting correct diagnosis and proper health care services for the clients. Furthermore, we have targeted at estimating the possibilities for helping clients to integrate into society. Given that most of our clients rely on services of various day-care institutions in Budapest, in this paper we have examined whether clients from different institutions have problems of different kinds. Method. Well-prepared interviewers have questioned the clients on health and social topics, took family anamneses, anthropological data (e.g., BMI, waist circumference), measured blood pressure and took blood samples of clients in order to screen liver enzymes and kidney function, ions, Hepatitis C and HIV infection. The data have been processed with the use of computer. Results. Earlier undiagnosed diseases have been screened among 46% of the examined clients. Clients from different shelters, differ in various aspects such as age, family anamnesis, and health hazardous attitudes. At the same time, well-distinguished differences have been found in the clients' health condition. Unexpectedly, the youngest group of clients - who come from own institute - have not been found the healthiest one. In many cases, dual or triple diagnoses could be found. Conclusion. There may exist differences of clients' lifecycles, diseases and problems found even among institutions with similar services or social profile. Providing these clients with health services in conventional health care institutions has been considered impossible for mutual intolerance. One of the possible solutions is that the involved social institutions could provide or have direct access to specialists of medical fields such as psychiatry and infectology or hepatology so that they could be more easily available to the clients.Copyright © Borgis.

N2  - An increasing body of research demonstrates that homelessness is an independent risk factor for morbidity and premature death. This paper compares the frequency of diagnoses between 2003 and 2009 in the computerised records of a specialist practice for homeless people. The changing morbidity trends revealed offer a basis for comparison with other services and suggest benefits from collaborative working, particularly around substance misuse and mental health. ©British Journal of General Practice.

N2  - To study the mortality and causes of death among homeless men and women in relation to the risk indicators, previous treatment for alcohol and drug abuse, previous treatment for mental disorders and non-Swedish citizenship. The mortality was studied in a cohort comprising 1,757 men and 526 women compared with the general population and persons with inpatient treatment for alcohol- and drug-related disorders. The follow-up period was from 1995 to 1997 until the end of 2005. The causes of death were analyzed. 421 deaths occurred during the follow-up period. The relative risk of death was 3.1, with no difference in mortality between homeless men and homeless women. Previous treatment for alcohol and drug abuse disorders was related to excess mortality and previous treatment for mental disease to lower mortality. Homeless people with inpatient treatment for alcohol or drug use disorders had no higher mortality than the general population in Stockholm with a similar history. There was a dominance of alcohol- and drug-related causes of death. Discussion(s): Compared with previous studies of homeless people in Stockholm the excess mortality among men found in this study is of the same magnitude. Mortality among women is lower. The mortality rate in homeless people with previous treatment for an alcohol and illicit drug use disorder did not differ from those treated for these disorders in the general population. The most important finding is that excess mortality among homeless men and women in Stockholm is entirely related to alcohol and drug abuse.

N2  - The present study attempts to examine the longitudinal impact of a curriculum-based positive youth development program, entitled the Project P.A.T.H.S. (Positive Adolescent Training through Holistic Social Programmes), on adolescent problem behavior in Hong Kong. Using a longitudinal randomized group design, six waves of data were collected from 19 experimental schools (n = 3,797 at Wave 1) in which students participated in the Project P.A.T.H.S. and 24 control schools (n = 4,049 at Wave 1). At each wave, students responded to questions asking about their current problem behaviors, including delinquency and use of different types of drugs, and their intentions of engaging in such behaviors in the future. Results based on individual growth curve modeling generally showed that the participants displayed lower levels of substance abuse and delinquent behavior than did the control students. Participants who regarded the program to be helpful also showed lower levels of problem behavior than did the control students. The present findings suggest that the Project P.A.T.H.S. is effective in preventing adolescent problem behavior in the junior secondary school years. ©2011 with author.

N2  - A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the methodological quality and effectiveness of behavioural smoking cessation interventions targeted at six disadvantaged groups; the homeless, prisoners, indigenous populations, at-risk youth, individuals with low socio-economic status and individuals with a mental illness. Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and PsycInfo databases were searched using MeSH and keywords for studies conducted in developed countries prior to October 2010. Included studies were assessed for methodological quality. A DerSimonian and Laird random effects meta-analysis was conducted where possible to explore the effectiveness of interventions for the different subgroups. A narrative review was conducted for studies unable to be included in the meta-analysis. Outcomes examined were abstinence rates at short-term (up to 3 months) and long-term (6 months or the longest) follow-up. Thirty-two relevant studies were identified. The majority (n = 20) were rated low in methodological quality. Results of the meta-analysis showed a significant increase in cessation for behavioural support interventions targeted at low-income female smokers at short-term follow-up [relative risk (RR) 1.68, confidence interval (CI) 1.21-2.33], and behavioural support interventions targeted at individuals with a mental illness at long-term follow-up (RR 1.35, CI 1.01-1.81). Results of the narrative review showed several promising interventions that increased cessation rates at 6-month or longer follow-up. Few well-controlled trials have examined the most effective smoking cessation strategies for highly disadvantaged groups, especially among the homeless, indigenous smokers and prisoners. The use of behavioural smoking cessation interventions for some socially disadvantaged groups appears promising; however, overall findings are inconsistent. Further research is needed to establish the most effective interventions for vulnerable high-risk groups. Special attention should be given to increasing sample size and power, and to sound evaluation methodology to overcome methodological limitations of conducting research with these high-risk groups. © 2011 The Authors, Addiction © 2011 Society for the Study of Addiction.

T1  - Does concurrent cocaine use compromise 1-year treatment outcomes for opiate users?

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - The current study aimed to determine whether cocaine use compromises treatment outcomes for opiate users. Data were collected from 404 opiate users at treatment intake and 1-year follow-up as part of a national treatment outcome study. Because of higher intake measures, cocaine users improved in more outcomes than nonusers, but comparisons between groups found that cocaine users had more coexisting problems. Regression analysis revealed that those who used cocaine at intake were more likely to use cocaine at 1-year follow-up, to commit crime, and to be homeless. It is concluded that treatment for opiate use "works" even in the presence of concurrent cocaine use.

N2  - A small percentage of high-risk patients accounts for a large proportion of Medicaid spending in the United States, which has become an urgent policy issue. Our objective was to pilot a novel patient-centered intervention for high-risk patients with frequent hospital admissions to determine its potential to improve care and reduce costs. Community and hospital-based care management and coordination intervention with pre-post analysis of health care utilization. We enrolled Medicaid fee-for-service patients aged 18-64 who were admitted to an urban public hospital and identified as being at high risk for hospital readmission by a validated predictive algorithm. Enrolled patients were evaluated using qualitative and quantitative interview techniques to identify needs such as transportation to/advocacy during medical appointments, mental health/substance use treatment, and home visits. A community housing partner initiated housing applications in-hospital for homeless patients. Care managers facilitated appropriate discharge plans then worked closely with patients in the community using a harm reduction approach. Nineteen patients were enrolled; all were male, 18/19 were substance users, and 17/19 were homeless. Patients had a total of 64 inpatient admissions in the 12 months before the intervention, versus 40 in the following 12 months, a 37.5% reduction. Most patients (73.3%) had fewer inpatient admissions in the year after the intervention compared to the prior year. Overall ED visits also decreased after study enrollment, while outpatient clinic visits increased. Yearly study hospital Medicaid reimbursements fell an average of $16,383 per patient. A pilot intervention for high-cost patients shows promising results for health services usage. We are currently expanding our model to serve more patients at additional hospitals to see if the pilot's success can be replicated. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01292096.

N2  - Among 559 street youth recruited between 2005 and 2007 in Vancouver, Canada, young drug users (<21 years of age) were compared with older drug users (>=21 years) with regard to recent drug use and sexual practices using multiple logistic regression. Older youth were more likely to be male and of Aboriginal ancestry, to have more significant depressive symptoms, to have recently engaged in crack smoking, and to have had a recent history of injection drug use. Young drug users, by contrast, were more likely to have engaged in recent binge alcohol use. Efforts to reduce drug use-related harm among street youth may be improved by considering the highly prevalent use of "harder" drugs and risk for depression among older youth.

N2  - This study identified homelessness, substance use, employment, and mental health correlates of homeless youths' arrest activity in 5 cities. Two hundred thirty-eight street youth from Los Angeles, Austin, Denver, New Orleans, and St. Louis were recruited using comparable sampling strategies. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression results reveal that being arrested for criminal activity is associated with length of homelessness, history of juvenile detention and incarceration, receiving income from theft, substance abuse, and mental illness. Arrests are also associated with interactions between lack of formal employment income and receiving income from theft and between drug and alcohol abuse/ dependency. Understanding the health and situational factors associated with homeless youths' delinquent activity has implications for providing more comprehensive health, mental health, and substance abuse services.

N2  - Street-involved youth experience a range of mental health problems with elevated rates of psychiatric disorders compared with non-homeless youth. The overall objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of a relationship-based intervention for homeless youth receiving services from agencies in downtown Toronto. The final sample included 15 homeless youth who met the study inclusion criteria. The intervention and comparison groups were compared at baseline and post-treatment on measures of mental health symptoms, hopelessness, self-esteem, resilience, and social connectedness. Participants receiving the intervention demonstrated a significant improvement in social connectedness, with a trend toward decreased hopelessness. Those participants who did not receive the intervention did not demonstrate any improvements in social connectedness and hopelessness. This preliminary pilot study suggests that providing a relationship-based intervention to street-involved youth may offer promise to strengthen social relationships and to mitigate overwhelming hopelessness and despair. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - This retrospective study compared frequencies of aggressive behaviors and abuse histories noted during a psychiatric intake assessment for children where animal cruelty was endorsed and a control sample of youth for whom animal cruelty was not endorsed to determine if rates of concerning behaviors differed significantly. Relative to the control group, the cruelty group was significantly more likely to have had problems with peers, perpetrated bullying, experienced sexual abuse, and have a history of sexually acting out. Recommendations for childhood animal cruelty screening in mental health settings are discussed. © 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Emilia Romagna, a northern Italian region, has a population of 4.27 million, of which 9.7% are immigrants. The objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) during the period 1996-2006 in not Italy-born compared to Italy-born cases. Data was obtained from the Regional TB surveillance system, from where personal data, clinical features and risk factors of all notified TB cases were extracted. 5377 TB cases were reported. The proportion of immigrants with TB, over the total number of TB cases had progressively increased over the years, from 19.1% to 53.3%. In the not Italy-born population, TB incidence was higher than in Italians (in 2006: 100.7 cases per 100,000 registered not Italy-born subjects and 83.9/100,000 adding 20% of estimated irregular presences to the denominators. TB incidence among Italians was 6.5/100,000 Italians). A progressive rise in the not Italy-born incident cases was observed but associated with a decline in TB incidence. Not Italy-born cases were younger compared to the Italy-born cases, and more frequently classified as "new cases" (OR 2.0 95%CI 1.61-2.49 for age group 20-39); 60.7% had pulmonary TB, 31.6% extra pulmonary and 7.6% disseminated TB. Risk factors for TB in this population group were connected to lower income status (homeless: OR 149.9 95%CI 20.7-1083.3 for age group 40-59). In low-incidence regions, prevention and control of TB among sub-groups at risk such as the foreign-born population is a matter of public health concern. In addition, increasing immigration rates may affect TB epidemiology. TB among immigrants is characterized by particular clinical features and risk factors, which should be analyzed in order to plan effective action.

T1  - Interventions to modify sexual risk behaviours for preventing HIV in homeless youth

Y1  - 2011//
N2  - Homeless youth are at high risk for HIV infection as a consequence of risky sexual behaviour. Interventions for homeless youth are challenging. Assessment of the effectiveness of interventions to modify sexual risk behaviours for preventing HIV in homeless youth is needed. To evaluate and summarize the effectiveness of interventions for modifying sexual risk behaviours and preventing transmission of HIV among homeless youth. We searched electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AIDSearch, Gateway, PsycInfo, LILACS), reference lists of eligible articles, international health agency publication lists, and clinical trial registries. The search was updated January 2010. We contacted authors of published reports and other key role players. Randomised studies of interventions to modify sexual risk behaviour (biological, self-reporting of sexual-risk behaviour or health-seeking behaviour) in homeless youth (12-24 years). Data from eligible studies were extracted by two reviewers. We assessed risk of bias per the Cochrane Collaborations tool. None of the eligible studies reported any primary biological outcomes for this review. Reports of self-reporting sexual risk behaviour outcomes varied across studies precluding calculation of summary measures of effect; we present the outcomes descriptively for each study. We contacted authors for missing or ambiguous data. We identified three eligible studies after screening a total of 255 unique records. All three were performed in the United States of America and recruited substance-abusing male and female adolescents (total N=615) through homeless shelters into randomised controlled trials of independent and non-overlapping behavioural interventions. The three trials differed in theoretical background, delivery method, dosage (number of sessions,) content and outcome assessments. Overall, the variability in delivery and outcomes precluded estimation of summary of effect measures. We assessed the risk of bias to be high for each of the studies. Whilst some effect of the interventions on outcome measures were reported, heterogeneity and lack of robustness in these studies necessitate caution in interpreting the effectiveness of these interventions. The body of evidence does not permit conclusions on the impact of interventions to modify sexual risk behaviour in homeless youth; more research is required. While the psychosocial and contextual factors that fuel sexual risk behaviours among homeless youth challenge stringent methodologies of RCT's, novel ways for program delivery and trial retention are in need of development. Future trials should comply with rigorous methodology in design, delivery, outcome measurement and reporting.

N2  - Background: There is limited information on self-perceived oral health of homeless populations. This study quantified self-reported oral health among a metropolitan homeless adult population and compared against a representative sample of the metropolitan adult population obtained from the National Survey of Adult Oral Health. Method(s): A total of 248 homeless participants (age range 17-78 years, 79% male) completed a self-report questionnaire. Data for an age-matched, representative sample of metropolitan-dwelling adults were obtained from Australia's second National Survey of Adult Oral Health. Percentage responses and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, with non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals used to identify statistically significant differences between the two groups. Result(s): Homeless adults reported poorer oral health than their age-matched general population counterparts. Twice as many homeless adults reported visiting a dentist more than a year ago and that their usual reason for dental attendance was for a dental problem. The proportion of homeless adults with a perceived need for fillings or extractions was also twice that of their age-matched general population counterparts. Three times as many homeless adults rated their oral health as 'fair' or 'poor'. Conclusion(s): A significantly greater proportion of homeless adults in an Australian metropolitan location reported poorer oral health compared with the general metropolitan adult population. © 2011 Australian Dental Association.

N2  - Background: Young drug misusers and the homeless both have a greater risk of death than their peers. This study sought to estimate the additional impact of homelessness on the risk of death for young drugs misusers. Method(s): From all admissions to NHS hospitals in Scotland between 1986 and 2001, those that were: drug misuse related, for people born between 1970 and 1986 and aged over 15 years (n=13 303), were selected. All subsequent admissions and registrations of death were linked to this dataset. Each admission was coded as homeless if the health board of residence was coded as 'no fixed abode'. 5-year survival after an admission was modelled using (1) life table and (2) proportional hazard models and then (3) differences in causes of deaths were explored. Result(s): Immediately after a drugs-related hospital admission there was no difference in survival between the homeless and those with a 'fixed address'. However, over a 3-year period the risk for those who were homeless was 3.5 times greater (CI 95% 1.2 to 12.8). This elevated risk seemed to be particularly focused on the second year after an admission. The causes of death were similar for the two groups. Conclusion(s): Although a homeless hospital admission is associated with a greater risk of death for young drug users, it is also a point in time when a young person is in contact with public services. An attempt to link their discharge with housing services would seem a potentially productive policy.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Access to sufficient food-in terms of both quality and quantity-is especially critical for children. Undernourishment during childhood and adolescence can have health implications, both short and long term. The prevalence of food insecurity was assessed in a sample of Vermont school children, as well as the relationship between food insecurity, participation in school breakfast or lunch, exercise and body mass index (BMI), all with a goal to identify needs to improve effectiveness of current programs. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional, 23-item self-administered survey of students attending a public middle school in Vermont. RESULT(S): Twenty percent of the children were residing in a food insecure household. No statistically significant differences were observed in terms of age, sex or BMI percentile and food security status. Food insecure (with or without hunger) participants were less likely to eat breakfast at home compared to food secure participants (67.1% vs 81.4%, p = .007). However, such differences were not observed between eating school breakfast or lunch. Sixty-two percent of food insecure (with or without hunger) participants engaged in daily exercise compared to 75.9% food secure participants (p = .014). CONCLUSION(S): Children in food insecure households were less likely to be physically active and to eat breakfast at home. However, the school breakfast program is negating any difference between the 2 groups in terms of eating breakfast at all. We consider this a success given the short- and long-term implications of food insecurity in children. We believe these findings have important implications for schools, policy makers, and programs to reduce food insecurity. © 2011, American School Health Association.

N2  - A world-wide recrudescence of tuberculosis has been seen, due to the deterioration of the health state of the population from many areas of the world, because of increasing number of homeless persons, and also the immigrants from countries with TB epidemic. The present epidemiological context draw attention to the necessity of early detection of the disease and the beginning of early directly observed treatment, preferably ambulatory, if the sick person doesn't have other complications, isn't infected with multidrog resistant bacili and lives in a properly social environment for his support. For the evaluation of tuberculosis epidemic in Olt county, the authors realised a retrospective study on a period of over 15 years (1990-2008), based on the analysis of the main epidemiological indices of TB epidemic in this county compared with Romania: global incidence both in adults and children, for new cases nd relapses apart, incidence of MDR-TB (multidrug resistant-tuberculosis) cases, mortality through tuberculosis. Global incidence of TB in Olt county almost doubled between 1990-2008, reaching 147, 4 per hundred thousand, with much higher values compared with the national ones. Olt county presents constant values over the national ones between 1995-2008, due to the global incidence and also to the new cases and relapses. The incidence of new cases in children in 2008 (20,4 per hundred thousand) was below the national level (28 per hundred thousand). The risk of illness for the 0-14 years old children from Olt county was significantly lower in 2008 compared with the previous year, which, toghether with a number of MDR-TB cases under 15, signifies a regress of the epidemic.

N2  - Art has been shown to be an empowering and engaging entity with numerous benefits to vulnerable populations, including the homeless persons and young adults. However, little is known how homeless young adults perceive the use of art as messages that can communicate the danger of initiating or continuing drug and alcohol use. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to solicit perspectives of homeless, drug-using young adults as to how art can be used to design messages for their peers about the danger of initiating or continuing drug and alcohol use. Qualitative methodology via focus group discussions was utilized to engage 24 homeless young adults enrolled from a drop-in site in Santa Monica, California. The findings revealed support for a myriad of delivery styles, including in-person communication, flyers, music, documentary film, and creative writing. The young adults also provided insight into the importance of the thematic framework of messages. Such themes ranged from empowering and hopeful messages to those designed to scare young homeless adults into not experimenting with drugs. The findings indicate that in addition to messages communicating the need to prevent or reduce drug and alcohol use, homeless young adults respond to messages that remind them of goals and dreams they once had for their future, and to content that is personal, real, and truthful. Our research indicates that messages that reinforce protective factors such as hope for the future and self-esteem may be as important to homeless young adults as information about the risks and consequences of drug use.

T1  - New modalities of respiratory support in the preterm infant

N2  - Several new modalities of mechanical ventilation have been introduced in recent years in an attempt to reduce complications associated with this therapy such as acute volutrauma and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. PATIENT TRIGGERED VENTILATION (PTV) The aim of PTV is that each mechanical breath be triggered by the infant's own inspiratory effort achieving synchronization between the patient and the ventilator. Different signals have been used for triggering the ventilator but currently the most common sensors are those detecting flow. During PTV the infant determines his/her own respiratory rate and tidal volumes are generated with lower airway pressures than during non-synchronized ventilation. By eliminating asynchrony between patient and ventilator, PTV may reduce the risk of mechanical trauma and minimize the cardiovascular effects of positive pressure ventilation. PTV facilitates weaning and can shorten the duration of oxygen therapy and IPPV in preterm infants. Types of Patient Triggered Ventilation Synchronized IMV (S-IMV): During S-IMV the patient can trigger a preset number of mechanical breaths each minute and maintains spontaneous breathing during the intervals. The ventilator provides a back up rate if apnea occurs. The airway pressure and duration of inspiration are determined by the operator. Assist - Control (AC): During AC each inspiratory effort triggers the ventilator and is mechanically supported. The ventilator also provides a preset back up rate when apnea occurs. The airway pressure is determined by the operator while the inspiratory time can be set by the operator or in some ventilators it can be terminated when inspiratory flow falls to a predetermined level. Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV): This mode is similar to assist-control and the ventilator is triggered by each inspiratory effort but the inspiration is terminated when the flow delivered to the infant decreases to a predetermined level. This strategy can be used to unload the respiratory system with minimal interference with the spontaneous timing of the respiratory cycle. This method has been shown to facilitate weaning and reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in preterm neonates. Possible drawbacks of PTV The high mechanical respiratory rate generated during assist control or pressure support ventilation can result in gas trapping and higher mean airway pressure increasing the risk for baro or volutrauma. Irregular respiratory rate from the infant can result in larger fluctuations in PaO2 and PaCO2. The pneumotachographs used to trigger the ventilator add dead space and this may produce CO2 retention in the smaller infants. Low sensitivity may result in lack or delayed triggering while excessive sensitivity may cause autotriggering resulting in runaway mechanical rate, hyperventilation, and gas trapping. This occurs when there are large leaks around the endotracheal tube or there is water condensation in the ventilator circuit. OTHER MODALITIES: Volume Targeted Ventilation (VTV): Newer ventilators measure the volume delivered to the patient as well as the expired tidal volume and continuously adjust the peak inspiratory pressure to maintain a preset expired tidal volume constant. This mode allows a significant reduction in PIP when the infant is able to generate a preset tidal volume by his own. On the other hand, it increases airway pressure to maintain a constant tidal volume when the infant does not make enough effort or when the mechanical characteristics of the respiratory system change. Nasal Ventilation: Noninvasive SIMV (N-SIMV) has been used as means of improving weaning success and avoiding mechanical ventilation. Randomized trials have shown lower extubation failure and better respiratory evolution with N-SIMV in comparison to NCPAP alone. Some studies comparing initial use of non-invasive IMV with NCPAP in infants with RDS showed a lower intubation rate and reduced oxygen dependency with noninvasive IMV.

N2  - Background: To implement a randomised trial of a risk-reduction intervention consisting of small group sessions, individual counselling and support groups for African- and Mexican-American adolescent women with STI and abuse history and evaluate the effects of the intervention model vs enhanced counselling for this group on STI at 6 and 12 month follow-up. Method(s): Mexican- and African-American adolescent women (n=409, 13-18 years) with STI and a history of abuse (physical, psychological, sexual) were recruited from public-health clinics in a metropolitan area of the USA. Following enrolment participants received targeted physical exams including contraception counselling and interviews including assessments for abuse, sexual risk behaviour, substance use, contraceptive use and STI. Participants were encouraged to return for unscheduled visits as needed for counselling or suspected STI or pregnancy. Scheduled follow-up rates at 6 (93%) and 12 (93%) months were high Participation in risk-reduction interventions was also high (92%). Surveillance for STI and pregnancy at off-site clinic visits was conducted and documented throughout the study. Result(s): At study entry, participants reported sexual (58.9%), physical (76.8%) and psychological (82.4%) abuse histories, ever pregnant (45%), currently pregnant (18.7%), ever used birth control (29.9%), currently in school (63.2%), previous arrest (56.2%), home runaway (54.5%), any substance use (94.1%) including marijuana (82.6%), heroin (13.4%), cigarettes (74.6%), alcohol (77.5%), cocaine (41.1%) and benzodiazepine (45%); forced sex (29.1%), sex when high/out of control (13.9%), sex with friends for benefits (36.2%), steady partner in last 3 months (77.4%) however off and on (31.4%). More workshop vs control group participants reported physical abuse (82.9% vs 71.0%), home runaway (63.1% vs 46.4%), cigarettes (78.9% vs 70.5%) and alcohol use (81.4% vs 73.8%). More control group participants were currently in school (68.1% vs 58.1%) and had used condoms (95.3% vs 86.4%). These variables plus age/ethnicity were initially included in the regression model for analysis of data from 0 to 6 and 0-12 month follow-ups. Fewer STI re-infections for intervention vs control group participants at each study interval were identified; physical abuse and substance use remained in the model. Conclusion(s): Behavioral interventions may reduce of STI among African-and Mexican-American adolescent women with STI and a history of abuse.

N2  - Background The food environment has been proposed as an important factor in terms of influencing diet. A high use and density of fast food outlets in lower socio-economic areas has been proposed as a possible cause of obesity. There is however limited data on actual use of these foods in New Zealand. Information on food purchasing practices can provide some insight into this. Objective To describe where food insecure households with children are purchasing food and how much they are spending on food. Design This descriptive analysis uses baseline data from a randomised control trial (Spend Study) conducted in Dunedin between June 2009 and May 2010. Low income ($45,000/year), food insecure households with children collected food-shopping receipts from all possible sources for four weeks (n=159). When receipts were not obtained households recorded the date the food was purchased, the retail outlet, and an itemised list of the food and associated prices. Food items were classified into groups based on where they were purchased. Many households did not report any expenditure for some food outlets therefore medians and interquartile ranges have been reported. Outcomes One quarter of this group reported 'low food security' meaning they were reliant on others for their regular food supply. Nearly half received a government benefit as their main source of income and half were single parent families. Weekly median expenditure on food from all food shops was $40.20 per person (standardised to one adult female). Eighty-five percent of this was attributed to supermarkets, 4% at local food shops and 3% at fast food/takeaway outlets. Median expenditure at restaurants and cafes was zero. Conclusion Most food purchased by food insecure households with children in Dunedin was from supermarkets with negligible purchases from fast food or takeaway outlets and restaurants and cafes. Further research relevant to the NZ environment into actual consumption of these foods is warranted.

N2  - Although research has clearly demonstrated the physical and mental health benefits derived from helping others, its impact on substance dependent (SD) individuals is not yet fully understood. Emerging research suggests that SD adolescents participate less frequently in prosocial behaviors and thus may receive fewer benefits (Pagano, Carter, Johnson, and Exline, 2010). This study aims to replicate prior findings that substance dependency is associated with reduced levels of prosocial behavior involvement with SD adults. Using a matched pair design, 43 adults admitted into an intensive outpatient treatment for SD were compared to 43 normative adults from the annual General Social Survey. Prosocial behaviors were assessed with the six-item General Social Survey (GSS) altruism module: (i) donating blood, (ii) giving food or money to a homeless person, (iii) volunteering, (iv) giving money to a charity, (v) looking after a neighbor's home, and (vi) carrying a stranger's belongings. With reference to the past year, items were rated from 1 = "more than once a week" to 6 "not at all in the past year." Approximately half (51.2%) of the clinical sample were female (n = 22), 43 years of age (M=42.77) on average, 68.29% were alcohol dependent, and 70.73% were substance dependent at the time of treatment admission. Across samples, most participants rarely or never donated blood in the past year (94.19%), approximately half had not cared for a neighbor's property (58.14%) or volunteered (59.30%), and one out of three rarely or never gave money to the homeless (30.23%) or charity (29.07%). When matched by age and gender to a normative adult sample, SD adults had significantly lower prosocial behaviors in three domains: (i) giving money to the homeless, F(1,85) = 13.89, p < 0.0001, (ii) giving money to charity, F(1,85) = 11.43, p < 0.0001, and (iii) volunteering, F(1,85) = 13.10, p < 0.0001. The results of this study are consistent with prior research with prior research with SD adolescents. SD adults, like SD youth, appear to give less money to the homeless and charity. SD adults also volunteered less than normative adults. These findings of lower monetary giving and volunteerism lend empirical support to the often observed lack of otheroriented regard among addicts/alcoholics. Replication of these findings in a larger, randomized controlled trial is warranted to explore the causal link between prosocial behaviors and alcohol/drug outcomes.

N2  - Complex approach allows identifying from many-sided positions integrative trends in research of mental health of growing generation. The case in point is evolutionary analysis of risk factors, role of adverse microsocial environment, negative impact of exogenous-organic and endogenous harms. In this aspect of relevance is distinguishing and all-sided development of new branch of the contemporary medicine - micropsychiatry (for this there are interesting basic data on grounding and propriety of description ecological fetal syndrome reflecting, in particular, influence of microdoses of radiation of negative consequences of the Semipalatinsk polygon etc.). Avalanche-like growth of indices of child homelessness and neglect is explained by consequences of microsocial crisis that is experienced by Russian family: this makes extraordinarily relevant problem of social orphanhood. The great attention must be paid to problem of mental health care of participants of pedagogical process (in a-chain-like-way "parent-child-teacher"). Researchers and physicians of child-adolescent subdivision of SI Mental Health Research Institute TSC SB RAMSci conduct work on psychotherapy of childhood and adolescence. In addition, there are many-year results of trials in the field of child-adolescent transculturology, conducted under auspices of the International Association of Ethnopsychologists and Ethnopsychotherapists (with active participation of Siberian scientists and physicians). Efforts of young researchers and representatives of older generation promote the successful development of new media, organizing-medical and preventive technologies allowing resolving the complex of tasks in heightening and mastering "quality of life" of Russian families, strengthening of the individual and societal health of the population of various regions of the country.

N2  - The problem of runaway girls is one of the social problems having become more prevalent and common subject for families, welfare centres and government in Iran.Escaped girls from their home, which have been prevalent, recently have been the problematic social subject for family, aid agencies and government. Objective(s): This study aimed at determining the demographic, personality and psychopathology characteristic of runaway girls from home in Shiraz. Method(s): Fifty girls who escaped from home and referred to the Women's Social Emergency and Rehabilitant Centre were compared with fifty girls who lived with their parents. They were assessed by semi-structured interview based on DSMIV-TR criteria, demographic questionnaire, GHQ-28 and EPQ-R-106. Result(s): The results showed that %86 of the runaway girls were resident in cities, and %40 of them was the first child of the family. Considering the familial stability, addicted parents, death and divorce of parents; the runaway girls did not have significant differences with control group, although they had significant differences in psychiatric disorders and physical abuse. Also they had more problems in social function and extroversion, lying, addiction and crime seeking. Conclusion(s): The high prevalence of psychopathology and social victims of the runaway girls demands serious attention by the non-governmental and governmental organizations for increasing their mental health and social supports.

N2  - Cognitive bias is a phenomenon that presents in clinical populations where anxious individuals tend to adopt a more pessimistic-like interpretation of ambiguous aversive stimuli whereas depressed individuals tend to adopt a less optimistic-like interpretation of ambiguous appetitive stimuli. To further validate the chick anxiety-depression model as a neuropsychiatric simulation we sought to quantify this cognitive endophenotype. Chicks exposed to an isolation stressor of 5 m to induce an anxiety-like or 60 m to induce a depressive-like state were then tested in a straight alley maze to a series of morphed ambiguous appetitive (chick silhouette) to aversive (owl silhouette) cues. In non-isolated controls, runway start and goal latencies generally increased as a function of greater amounts of aversive characteristics in the cues. In chicks in the anxiety-like state, runway latencies were increased to aversive ambiguous cues, reflecting more pessimistic-like behavior. In chicks in the depression-like state, runway latencies were increased to both aversive and appetitive ambiguous cues, reflecting more pessimistic-like and less optimistic-like behavior, respectively. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to (1) identify trajectories of homeless youth remaining sheltered or returning to shelter over a period of 2 years, and (2) to identify predictors of these trajectories. Method(s): A sample of 426 individuals aged 1424 years receiving services at homeless youth serving agencies completed six assessments over 2 years. Latent class growth analysis was applied to the reports of whether youth had been inconsistently sheltered (i.e., living on the street or in a squat, abandoned building, or automobile) or consistently sheltered (i.e., not living in any of those settings) during the past 3 months. Result(s): Three trajectories of homeless youth remaining sheltered or returning to shelter were identified: consistently sheltered (approximately 41% of the sample); inconsistently sheltered, short-term (approximately 20%); and inconsistently sheltered, long-term (approximately 39%). Being able to go home and having not left of one's own accord predicted greater likelihood of membership in the short-term versus the long-term inconsistently sheltered trajectory. Younger age, not using drugs other than alcohol or marijuana, less involvement in informal sector activities, being able to go home, and having been homeless for <1 year predicted membership in the consistently sheltered groups versus the long-term inconsistently sheltered groups in the multivariate analyses. Conclusion(s): Findings suggest that being able to return home is more important than the degree of individual impairment (e.g., substance use or mental health problems) when determining the likelihood that a homeless youth follows a more or a less chronically homeless pathway. © 2011 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

N2  - Objectives: To examine methamphetamine use and its association with sexual behavior among young men who have sex with men. Design(s): Cross-sectional observational analysis. Setting(s): Eight US cities. Participant(s): As part of the Adolescent Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions, adolescent boys and young men who have sex with men, aged 12 to 24 years, were recruited from social venues (eg, clubs, parks, and street corners) between January 3, 2005, and August 21, 2006, to complete a study survey. Main Outcome Measure(s): Reported methamphetamine use in the past 90 days and reported sexual risk behavior compared with individuals reporting no hard drug use and individuals reporting hard drug use in the past 90 days. Result(s): Among 595 adolescent boys and young men, 64 reported recent methamphetamine use, and 444 reported no recent hard drug use (87 reported use of hard drugs other than methamphetamine). Recent methamphetamine use was associated with a history of sexually transmitted diseases (51.6%), 2 or more sex partners in the past 90 days (85.7%), sex with an injection drug user (51.6%), and sex with someone who has human immunodeficiency virus (32.8%) compared with individuals reporting no recent hard drug use (21.1%, 63.1%, 10.7%, and 11.1%, respectively; Plambdatau.05 for all [n=441]). Recent users of methamphetamine were more likely to have a history of homelessness (71.9%) and were less likely to be currently attending school (35.9%) compared with individuals reporting no recent hard drug use (28.4% and 60.4%, respectively; Plambdatau.001 for both). Conclusion(s): Adolescent boys and young men who have sex with men and use methamphetamine seem to be at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus. Prevention programs among this age group should address issues like housing, polydrug use, and educational needs. ©2011 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

N2  - This study aimed to examine: 1) the relationship between being a runaway and the time since the first absconding event and adolescent substance use; 2) whether different kinds of psychoactive substances have a different temporal relationship to the first absconding event; and 3) whether the various reasons for the first absconding event are associated with different risks of substance use. Participants were drawn from the 2004-2006 nationwide outreach programs across 26 cities/towns in Taiwan. A total of 17,133 participants, age 12-18 years, who completed an anonymous questionnaire on their experience of running away and substances use and who were now living with their families, were included in the analysis. The lifetime risk of tobacco, alcohol, betel nut, and illegal drug/inhalant use increased steadily from adolescents who had experienced a trial runaway episode (one time lasting or= 2 times or lasting > 1 day), when compared to those who had never ran away. Adolescents who had their first running away experience > 6 months previously had a greater risk of betel nut or illegal drug/inhalant use over the past 6-months than those with a similar experience within the last 6 months. Both alcohol and tobacco use were most frequently initiated before the first running away, whereas both betel nut and illegal drug/inhalant use were most frequently initiated after this event. When adolescents who were fleeing an unsatisfactory home life were compared to those who ran away for excitement, the risk of alcohol use was similar but the former tended to have a higher risk of tobacco, betel nut, and illegal drug/inhalant use. More significant running away and a longer time since the first absconding experience were associated with more advanced substance involvement among adolescents now living in a family setting. Once adolescents had left home, they developed additional psychoactive substance problems, regardless of their reasons for running away. These findings have implications for caregivers, teachers, and healthcare workers when trying to prevent and/or intervening in adolescent substance use.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among street-involved youth greatly exceed that of the general adolescent population; however, little is known regarding the structural factors that influence disease transmission risk among this population. METHOD(S): Between September 2005 and October 2006, 529 street-involved youth were enroled in a prospective cohort known as the At Risk Youth Study (ARYS). We examined structural factors associated with number of sex partners using quasi-Poisson regression and consistent condom use using logistic regression. RESULT(S): At baseline, 415 (78.4%) were sexually active, of whom 253 (61.0%) reported multiple sex partners and 288 (69.4%) reported inconsistent condom use in the past six months. In multivariate analysis, self-reported barriers to health services were inversely associated with consistent condom use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.52, 95%CI: 0.25 - 1.07). Structural factors that were associated with greater numbers of sex partners included homelessness (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 1.54, 95%CI: 1.11 - 2.14) and having an area restriction that affects access to services (aIRR = 2.32, 95%CI: 1.28 - 4.18). Being searched or detained by the police was significant for males (aIRR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.02 - 1.81). CONCLUSION(S): Although limited by its cross-sectional design, our study found several structural factors amenable to policy-level interventions independently associated with sexual risk behaviours. These findings imply that the criminalization and displacement of street-involved youth may increase the likelihood that youth will engage in sexual risk behaviours and exacerbate the negative impact of resultant health outcomes. Moreover, our findings indicate that environmental-structural interventions may help to reduce the burden of these diseases among street youth in urban settings.

T1  - Feasibility and benefit of parent participation in a program emphasizing preschool child language development while homeless
A1  - O'Neil-Pirozzi T.M. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - PURPOSE: This exploratory study examined the feasibility of homeless parents' participation in an intervention to increase use of facilitating language strategies during interactions with their preschool children while residing in family homeless shelters. This study also examined the intervention's impact on the parents' use of facilitating language strategies, regardless of parent performance on a single-word receptive vocabulary test. METHOD(S): Using a prospective, pretest/posttest comparison group design, 12 parents were randomly assigned to a 4-session experimental group training emphasizing use of facilitating language utterances with children following vocabulary testing. Four parents were randomly assigned to a control group intervention. RESULT(S): It was feasible for parents to participate in the intervention. Before the intervention, individual experimental group parents with poor test performance demonstrated relatively high use of facilitating language utterances. After the intervention, the experimental group increased use of facilitating language utterances during interactions with their children. CONCLUSION(S): This exploratory study provides initial evidence that it is feasible for parents to participate in, and benefit from, a brief language-based group intervention while residing in family homeless shelters. Further study of language-based interventions for these at-risk families and of the possible impact of parent language functioning on intervention benefit is needed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that youth who are homeless engage in high-risk behaviors. However, there has been little information published on nutritional and physical activity behaviors in this population, and studies comparing homeless youth in school with their non-homeless peers are scarce. This study compares weight-related risk behaviors of public high school students in Massachusetts based on homeless status. METHOD(S): We obtained data from 3264 9th through 12th grade students who participated in the 2005 Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Multivariable logistic regression, controlling for gender, grade, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation, was performed to assess the relationship between homeless status as defined by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and weight-related indicators. Analyses were weighted and adjusted for the multistage complex sampling design. RESULT(S): Of this sample, 4.2% reported being homeless (n = 152). Higher prevalence of homelessness was found among males, racial/ethnic minorities, sexual minorities, and students who were not in a traditional grade level. The distribution of body mass index was similar among students who were homeless and non-homeless (underweight 4.0 and 3.0%, and overweight 27.1 and 27.1%, respectively). Homeless students were more likely than non-homeless students to report disordered weight-control behaviors including fasting (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.5) and diet pill use (aOR 3.3, 95% CI 1.6-6.9). CONCLUSION(S): More than 4% of public high school students in Massachusetts meet the federal definition of homelessness. These students are at high risk for disordered weight-control behaviors. Policy decisions at the school, state, and federal levels should make a concerted effort to target these students with social services and nutritional interventions. © 2009, American School Health Association.

N2  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to find out whether young men exempted from compulsory military or civil service constitute a group of young men in need of psychosocial support from the social and health services. METHOD(S): The study involved a total of 356 men exempted from military or civil service and 440 young men conscripted into service. The research data were collected using questionnaires and register data. RESULT(S): Men exempted from military or civil service differed from conscripts in terms of psychosocial well-being. Compared with conscripts, they had already been in a more disadvantaged position with regard to their childhood living conditions. As young adults, they had met with a greater number of mental and social problems than conscripts: alcohol-related problems, unemployment, financial problems, homelessness, lack of social support and psychological distress. Young men exempted from service typically suffered from an accumulation of problems. Diverse problems were common particularly among men who had interrupted their service. There was a moderate correlation between current and childhood adversities. CONCLUSION(S): Men exempted from military or civil service comprise a group with a wide range of psychosocial problems and are a target group for supportive interventions. Special attention should be paid to the prevention of problems and promotion of well-being of men who interrupt their service. The accumulation of problems poses a challenge for the development of such interventions.

T1  - Household food insecurity in Ontario

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To identify socio-demographic factors associated with household food insecurity in the Ontario population. METHOD(S): Using data from the Ontario Share File of the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 2.2, multivariate logistic regression was applied to identify the socio-demographic characteristics of households most likely to report food insecurity. RESULT(S): Of the estimated 379,100 food-insecure households in Ontario in 2004, 55% were reliant on salaries or wages, 23% on social assistance, and 13% on pensions or seniors' benefits. The prevalence of food insecurity increased markedly as income adequacy declined, rising to 47% in the lowest category of income adequacy. Food insecurity was also more prevalent among tenant households and single-person and single-parent households. When all socio-demographic factors were taken into account, three potent socio-demographic correlates of household food insecurity in Ontario were identified: low income adequacy, social assistance as the main source of income, and not owning one's dwelling. Compared to households whose main source of income was salary or wages, the adjusted odds of experiencing food insecurity was 3.69 (95% CI: 2.33, 5.84) for households reliant on social assistance, but 0.44 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.67) for those reliant on pensions or seniors' benefits. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the need for more adequate social assistance benefit levels, but also point to the need for better income supports for low-waged workers in Ontario so that they have sufficient financial resources to purchase the food they need.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to assess predictors of sexual and physical assault among homeless women. A multivariate, correlation design was utilized to identify independent correlates of adult physical and sexual assault. The sample consisted of 202 homeless women residing in shelters or living on the street in the Skid Row area of Los Angeles. Respondents reporting a history of child sexual abuse were almost four times more likely to report being sexually assaulted as adults and were almost two and one third times more likely to report being physically assaulted as adults. A range of factors increase homeless women's risk of adult physical and sexual victimization, including child sexual abuse, substance use, lifetime sex trade activity, and previous incarceration. It is important for homeless service providers to develop an individual risk profile for homeless women and to intervene in order to decrease their risk of re-victimization. © 2010 Meharry Medical College.

A1  - Finfgeld-Connett D. 
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - The purpose of this investigation was to more comprehensively articulate the experiences of homeless women and make evidence-based inferences regarding optimal social services. This study was conducted using qualitative meta-synthesis methods. As youth, homeless women experience challenging circumstances that leave them ill-prepared to prevent and resolve homelessness in adulthood. Resolution of homelessness occurs in iterative stages: crisis, assessment, and sustained action. To enhance forward progression through these stages, nurses are encouraged to promote empowerment in concordance with the Transtheoretical and Harm Reduction Models. Services that are highly valued include physical and mental health care and child care assistance. Copyright © 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - This study characterizes the prevalence of drug use among Filipino street children compared with Filipino non-street children. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 311 street children and 528 non-street children aged 13 to 17 years. Participants were enrolled through 4 nonprofit organizations and 3 high schools located in Manila, Philippines. After adjustment for age and sex, street children with little or no contact with their families were 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.7-2.3) times more likely to smoke tobacco, 1.3 (95% CI = 1.2-1.5) times more likely to use alcohol, 36.7 (95% CI = 16.4-82.0) times more likely to use inhalants, and 5.5 (95% CI = 3.6-8.2) times more likely to use illegal drugs than their non-street counterparts. Street children who maintained contact with their families, compared with non-street children, were 8.7 (95% CI = 3.9-19.4) times more likely to use inhalants and 2.8 (95% CI = 1.7-4.6) times more likely to use illegal drugs. There was no significant difference in tobacco or alcohol use between street children who maintained contact with their families and non-street children. All street children were significantly more likely to have been given or sold a drug in the past 30 days and to have received drug education compared with non-street children. Filipino street children are at greater risk of abusing drugs than are non-street children, with street children who do not maintain family contact being at greatest risk.

N2  - The elopement of a child with Asperger syndrome was assessed using functional analyses and was treated in two school settings (classroom and resource room). Functional analyses indicated that elopement was maintained by access to attention in the resource room and obtaining a preferred activity in the classroom. Attention- and tangible-based interventions were compared in an alternating treatments design in both settings. Results validated the findings of the functional analyses. Implications for the assessment and treatment of elopement are discussed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A single-site study described differences between homeless and non-homeless patient utilization of the emergency department (ED). No prior study has examined ED use by the homeless on a national level. OBJECTIVE(S):To analyze national ED utilization by homeless patients. METHOD(S): Data were extracted from the 2005 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. SAS callable SUDAAN was used to produce national estimates. Results. Of the 115 million visits to national EDs in 2005, 472,922 were made by homeless patients. In comparison with the non-homeless, these patients were more likely to arrive by ambulance and to be uninsured. Both groups had similar admission rates and triage urgency, with a trend toward increased diagnostic testing for homeless patients. CONCLUSION(S): Homeless patients who visited EDs in 2005 were more likely to arrive by ambulance despite similar triage urgency and admission rates compared with the non-homeless, and were less likely to be insured.

T1  - A Pilot Study Comparing Two Developmental Screening Tools for Use With Homeless Children
A1  - Chiu S.-H.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Homelessness and poverty can present serious health issues for children, including those associated with developmental delays. Early identification and intervention may decrease risk associated with delayed development. Parent-completed measures have been used to help screen for children's development, but little is known about how they may enhance early detection with homeless children. The primary aims of this pilot study were to describe growth and developmental characteristics of homeless children and to compare a parent-completed measure with professionally-conducted developmental screening results. A prospective, comparative study was conducted with 20 homeless mothers and their 21 children. Health professionals used the Denver Developmental Screening Test II, identifying nine children with possible language delay. Mothers completed the Ages and Stages Questionnaires and identified three areas of concern: fine motor (n = 9), communication/language (n = 4), and problem solving (n = 4). The percentage agreement between these two tools was strongest in gross motor (95%) and personal social development (95%) but weakest in language development (67%). While it is essential for all children, developmental screening is particularly crucial for homeless children because of increased risks related to poverty and homelessness. Nurses and nurse practitioners are in a unique position to assess applicability of such instruments and to provide critically needed interventions for these children. © 2010 National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Treatment evaluation for alcohol problem, runaway adolescents and their families is rare. This study recruited primary alcohol problem adolescents (N = 119) and their primary caretakers from two runaway shelters and assigned them to (a) home-based ecologically based family therapy (EBFT), (b) office-based functional family therapy (FFT), or (c) service as usual (SAU) through the shelter. Findings showed that both home-based EBFT and office-based FFT significantly reduced alcohol and drug use compared with SAU at 15-month postbaseline. Measures of family and adolescent functioning improved over time in all groups. However, significant differences among the home- and office-based interventions were found for treatment engagement and moderators of outcome. © 2009 American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy.

T1  - Comparisons of prevention programs for homeless youth
A1  - Arnold E.M.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - There are six HIV prevention programs for homeless youth whose efficacy has been or is currently being evaluated: STRIVE, the Community Reinforcement Approach, Strengths-Based Case Management, Ecologically-Based Family Therapy, Street Smart, and AESOP (street outreach access to resources). Programs vary in their underlying framework and theoretical models for understanding homelessness. All programs presume that the youths' families lack the ability to support their adolescent child. Some programs deemphasize family involvement while others focus on rebuilding connections among family members. The programs either normalize current family conflicts or, alternatively, provide education about the importance of parental monitoring. All programs aim to reduce HIV-related sexual and drug use acts. A coping skills approach is common across programs: Problem-solving skills are specifically addressed in four of the six programs; alternatively, parents in other programs are encouraged to contingently reward their children. Each program also engineers ongoing social support for the families and the youth, either by providing access to needed resources or by substituting a new, supportive relationship for the existing family caretaker. All of the interventions provide access to health and mental health services as basic program resources. A comparison of HIV prevention programs for homeless youth identifies the robust components of each and suggests which programs providers may choose to replicate. © 2008 Society for Prevention Research.

N2  - Rationale: Variable ventilation modes showed to be superior to conventional monotonic modes. We aimed at investigating the effects of variable pressure support ventilation (noisy PSV), proportional assist ventilation (PAV) and conventional pressure support ventilation (PSV) on breathing pattern, pulmonary function, inspiratory effort and lung injury. Method(s): 24 juvenile pigs (31.4, 26.2 a 36.2 kg) were anesthetized, intubated and ventilated in volume controlled mode. Acute lung injury was induced by repetitive saline lung lavage and spontaneous breathing resumed. Animals were randomly assigned to one of the assisted ventilation modes (n=8/mode) and ventilated for 6h. In all assisted modes the target mean VT was 6 mL/kg. During noisy PSV, pressure support was randomly varied (normal distribution, coefficient of variation = 30%). During PAV, flow assist was fixed at 50-80% and volume assist was adjusted to achieve target mean VT. Lung functional parameters were measured and regional distribution of ventilation assessed by electrical impedance tomography. After animals were killed, lungs were extracted for analysis of histopathological damage, mechanical stress and inflammatory response. Statistical analysis was performed using univariate and multivariate methods. The VT pattern was investigated with detrended fluctuation analysis. Result(s): Noisy PSV and PAV showed higher variability of VT compared to PSV, but intratidal runaway was observed during PAV. PAV was associated with a complex deterministic (natural), while noisy PSV with a stochastic (random) pattern of variability. Both noisy PSV and PAV improved oxygenation compared to PSV. Histological lung damage, mechanical stress, inflammatory response, hemodynamics and regional distribution of ventilation did not differ among groups. PAV was associated with higher inspiratory esophageal pressure time products compared to noisy PSV and PSV. Conclusion(s): Randomly (noisy PSV) and naturally (PAV) enhanced variability of VT during assisted ventilation resulted in improved oxygenation without worsening of lung injury compared to conventional PSV. During protective assisted ventilation with low VT, noisy PSV reduced the inspiratory effort compared to PAV.

N2  - This community-based project engages high risk, older youth in unique cultural settings as experts in the process of systematically adapting the Keepin' It REAL curriculum by having them rewrite the scenarios in the student workbook and remake the accompanying videos, while leaving the core, evidence-based curricula intact. This innovative project, accomplished through a NIDA K01 award, supports honoring and utilizing the wisdom and expertise of high risk adolescents between 14-19 y/o in ten high risk community settings [i.e., alternative schools, a low-income public high school, a homeless youth shelter, a juvenile justice day program setting, a YMCA-run program at a low income housing center, a drop-in center for GLBTQ youth, and a youth advocacy group on the Texas-Mexico border.] These youth know better than anyone which drugs are popular in their arenas, how and by whom they are being used, and what the true consequences are that their peers will pay attention to in a prevention program. In addition, they know the specific language, styles, and events that highlight their peers' unique experiences (e.g., drug court for incarcerated youth, gay partners for GLBTQ youth, and details about living on the street, for homeless youth). The youth adapted versions (with new reality based scenarios and student-created videos) created in Phase I have then been tested in Phase II in which the original curriculum and the adapted version are both facilitated by agency staff in the sites noted above. A comparison group was also tested. Focus group data were collected at pre and post tests for Phase I and Phase II. These data confirmed that alcohol and drug use was pervasive and normalized in these high risk settings. The youth consistently concurred that videos and scenarios growing from their own life experiences would impact them more than one created elsewhere by people who they do not know. The findings of Phase I (the adaptation of the curricula) and Phase II (the experience of both the original and adapted versions of the curricula) include the following: that adaptation processes engage youth that are often adverse to prevention programs and messages, that the Keepin' It REAL curricula (both original and adapted versions) help youth reduce their substance use), and that adapted versions are significantly more effective than the original curricula (especially at reducing alcohol intake). The most surprising finding is that youth that participate in the process of adapting the curricula to their unique high risk groups, despite their perception that "it is too late for us," show changes in their attitudes and behaviors including reducing their substance use at by the end of the adaptation process. The findings of this study support adaptation processes to improve the curriculum and it has emerged that the actual act of adapting the evidence-based program for others shifts attitudes and behaviors regarding drugs and alcohol. Due to this innovative project, it is emerging that the youth's expert perceptions on their culture and experiences are not only critical for the success of such programs, but also that their involvement in the adaptation process is a positive intervention in and of itself.

N2  - Introduction: Mental health problems impose substantial burdens on patients and health care. A range of effective interventions exist, however many people with mental distress are disadvan-taged: either because they are unable to access care; or because access does not lead to adequate care. Our aims are to clarify mental health needs in under-served groups; and to develop, test and disseminate credible interventions. Method(s):AMPis a five year research programme based innorth-west England, involving people with mental health problems from eight under-served groups (minority ethnic communities, asylum-seekers, homeless, unemployed, adolescents, elders, people with advanced cancers or unexplained symptoms) and service providers. In our knowledge generation phase we combined systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis of barriers to access and their solutions, with interviews with stakeholders from under-served groups and care providers. Result(s): Key emergent findings included concepts of silent suffering and embodied suffering, double stigma, the risks of engagement with services, and the cultural insensitivity of existing psychosocial interventions. We refined these findings through a formal consensus process, and have now developed innovative interventions in three inter-linked domains: community engagement, primary care development and sensitized psychosocial interventions.We are testing these interventions in terms of their acceptability and credibility to people from underserved groups, impact on mental health, and service implications. We will devise a focused implementation experiment in two primary care trusts, and disseminate our findings across primary health care. Conclusion(s): AMP has already achieved important new understanding of the mental health needs of under-served groups, and is now testing three innovative interventions.

N2  - Background: Delivery of effective primary, secondary, and tertiary injury prevention in homeless populations is complex and could be greatly aided by an improved understanding of contributing factors. Method(s): Injury and health conditions were examined for hospitalized New York City homeless persons (n = 326,073) and low socioeconomic status (SES) housed residents (n = 1,202,622) using 2000 to 2002 New York statewide hospital discharge data (Statewide Program and Research Cooperative System). Age- and gender-adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated within age groups of 0.1 years to 9 years, 10 years to 19 years, 20 years to 64 years, and >=65 years, with low SES housed as the comparison group. Result(s): Comorbid conditions, injury, and injury mechanisms varied by age, gender, race or ethnicity, and housing status. Odds of unintentional injury in homeless versus low SES housed were higher in younger children aged 0 years to 9 years (1.34, 1.27-1.42), adults (1.13, 1.09-1.18), and elderly (1.25, 1.20-1.30). Falls were increased by 30% in children, 14% in adolescents or teenagers, and 47% in the elderly. More than one-quarter (26.9%) of fall hospitalizations in homeless children younger than 5 years were due to falls from furniture with more than threefold differences observed in both 3 year and 4 year olds (p = 0.0001). Several comorbid conditions with potential to complicate injury and postinjury care were increased in homeless including nutritional deficiencies, infections, alcohol and drug use, and mental disorders. Conclusion(s): Although homelessness presents unique, highly complex social and health issues that tend to overshadow the need for and the value of injury prevention, this study highlights potentially fruitful areas for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. ©2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

T1  - Restoring Healthy Developmental Trajectories for Sexually Exploited Young Runaway Girls: Fostering Protective Factors and Reducing Risk Behaviors
A1  - Saewyc E.M.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Purpose: To examine effects of the Runaway Intervention Program (RIP), a strengths-based home visiting, case management, and group support program for sexually assaulted or exploited young runaway girls; staffed by advanced-practice nurses, RIP aims to restore healthy developmental trajectories by reestablishing protective factors, reducing trauma responses, and lowering risk behaviors that are common sequelae of sexual violence. Method(s): Quasi-experimental study of RIP girls (N = 68) ages 12 to 15 (mean, 13.75 years), assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months for changes in family and school connectedness, other adult caring, self-esteem, emotional distress, suicidality, recent substance use, plus risky sexual behaviors. Responses at each time were also compared to nonabused and abused urban ninth-grade girls (mean age, 14.64, N = 12,775) from the 2004 Minnesota Student Survey (MSS). Analyses used paired t-tests, McNemars test, Wilcoxon sign-rank, chi-square, and Pearson's correlations. Result(s): At entry, RIP girls were most like sexually abused MSS peers, with lower levels of protective factors and higher levels of distress and risk behaviors than nonabused MSS girls (p < .05 to p < .01). However, they saw significant improvements by 6 and 12 months, such that all measures of protective factors, positive development, distress, and risk behaviors more closely resembled nonabused MSS girls by 12 months. Of equal note, RIP girls with the greatest emotional distress, the lowest levels of connectedness, and lowest self-esteem at baseline demonstrated the greatest improvement (all p < .001). Conclusion(s): This appears to be a promising intervention for restoring sexually abused runaway girls to a healthy developmental trajectory. © 2010 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

T1  - Impact of Running Away on Girls' Sexual Onset

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to longitudinally examine the impact of running away on sexual onset, and to determine the 12-month prevalence of sexual onset among runaway females. Method(s): The sample consists of adolescent females from Waves 1 and 2 of the Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 4,564; age range = 11-18 years). Voluntary or involuntary sexual onset at Wave 1 results in exclusion from the analysis. A logistic regression model is fit, which examines sociodemographic characteristics, protective factors (e.g., parental and academic bonds), and running away and other risk behaviors on sexual onset. Result(s): Our study confirms that more than one out of thee females becomes sexually active within 12 months of running away. Only 17% of females who never report a runaway episode experience sexual onset. School bonds, dating and romance, alcohol use, delinquency, and runaway behavior have main effects in the longitudinal analysis. Runaways are 1.7 times more likely to report sexual onset. Conclusion(s): This study applies the risk amplification model to runaways in the general population. Running away is a turning point in the developmental trajectory, and puts girls at risk of sexual onset a year later compared to their nonrunaway counterparts. A multipronged approach is needed to address the sexual risk characteristics of girls who return home. © 2010 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

N2  - Aim: To determine the short-term outcomes of newborn infants and mothers exposed to antenatal amphetamines in the state of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory during 2004. Method(s): Amphetamine exposure was determined retrospectively using ICD-10 AM morbidity code searches of hospital medical records and from records of local drug and alcohol services. Records were reviewed on site. All public hospitals (n = 101) with obstetric services were included. Result(s): Amphetamines were used by 200 (22.9%) of the 871 identified drug-using mothers. Most women (182, 91%) injected amphetamines intravenously. Compared with the other 669 drug users, amphetamine-using mothers were significantly more likely to use multiple classes of drugs (45.0% vs 7.8%), be subject to domestic violence (32.1% vs 17.5%), be homeless (14.8% vs 4.9%) and be involved with correctional services (19.8% vs 9.7%). The incidence of comorbid psychiatric illnesses were significantly higher (57.4% vs 41.7%) and their infants were more likely to be preterm (29.5% vs 20.4%), notified as children at risk (67.0% vs 32.8%), fostered before hospital discharge (14.5% vs 5.5%) and less likely to be breastfed (27.0% vs 41.6%). Conclusion(s): Amphetamine-exposed mothers and infants in public hospitals of NSW and the ACT are at significantly higher risk of adverse social and perinatal outcomes even when compared with mothers and infants exposed to other drugs of dependency. Increased vigilance for amphetamine exposure is recommended due to a high prevalence of use, especially in Australia, as a recreational drug.

T1  - Becoming homeless, being homeless, and resolving homelessness among women
A1  - Finfgeld-Connett D. 
Y1  - 2010//
N2  - The purpose of this investigation was to more comprehensively articulate the experiences of homeless women and make evidence-based inferences regarding optimal social services. This study was conducted using qualitative meta-synthesis methods. As youth, homeless women experience challenging circumstances that leave them ill-prepared to prevent and resolve homelessness in adulthood. Resolution of homelessness occurs in iterative stages: crisis, assessment, and sustained action. To enhance forward progression through these stages, nurses are encouraged to promote empowerment in concordance with the Transtheoretical and Harm Reduction Models. Services that are highly valued include physical and mental health care and child care assistance.

T1  - Effective Interventions for Homeless Youth. A Systematic Review

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Context: To date, there has not been clear evidence regarding interventions that are effective in addressing the specific needs of homeless youth. A systematic and comprehensive international review on effective interventions for homeless youth is presented. This study seeks to provide an accurate and complete picture of effective interventions for homeless youth by collecting, summarizing, categorizing, and evaluating quantitative studies (i.e., those that have assessed treatment outcomes). Evidence acquistion: The following databases were searched in 2008: PsycINFO, ERIC, MEDLINE, and Cochrane were searched from 1985 through 2008 using specific key words: interventions and programs, with homeless youth (s), homeless adolescents, street youth (s), runaways and throwaways. In addition, references of key articles were searched by hand. Eleven studies met pre-established inclusion criteria. To determine study quality, a set of operational parameters was formulated to rate each study as either good, fair, or poor. Evidence Synthesis: There is no compelling evidence that specific interventions are effective for homeless youth, owing to moderate study quality and the small number of intervention studies. Conclusions that can be drawn from the studies are limited by the heterogeneity of interventions, participants, methods, and outcome measures. Many interventions focused on reduction of substance abuse, whereas other important outcomes, such as quality of life, have received little attention. No study received a quality rating of good, and four studies were rated as fair. Most convincing, but still marginal, were results of interventions based on cognitive-behavioral approaches, which revealed some positive results on psychological measures. Conclusion(s): More methodologically sound research is needed to determine what specific interventions are beneficial for subgroups of homeless youth. Implications for future research are discussed. © 2010 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

N2  - Background Behavioral intervention research has lagged behind biomedical research in developing principles for defining, categorizing, identifying, reporting, and monitoring adverse events and unanticipated problems. Purpose In this article we present a set of principles for defining adverse events and how they were applied in a large national multi-site family therapy study for substance-using adolescents, The Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT trade;) Effectiveness Study. Methods The BSFTtrade; Effectiveness study tested how BSFTtrade; compares to Treatment as Usual (TAU) for the treatment of drug-abusing adolescents. During protocol development, experts in the BSFTtrade; intervention, medical safety officers, ethicists and senior investigators defined the procedures for identifying, tracking and reporting adverse events for drug using adolescents as well as their family members. During this process the team identified five key guiding principles. Results The five guiding principles that were used for defining adverse events in this behavioral trial were that that the adverse events should be validated and plausible, and that monitoring systems should assess relatedness, be systematic, and are a shared responsibility. The following non-serious adverse events were identified: arrest, school suspension and drop out, runaway, kicked out of home and violence. The serious adverse events in this study for the identified adolescent participant and all other consented family members were physical or sexual abuse, suicidal behavior, homicidal behavior, hospitalization (drug related or psychiatric related only) and death. The methods used in categorizing, identifying and reporting adverse events in the BSFTtrade; trial are outlined. More than 50% of the adolescent population (277/481 = 57.5 %) experienced an adverse event during the trial. Family members experienced less adverse events, (61/1338 = 4.5%). The most common event for the adolescent group was arrest (164/277= 59.2%), followed by school suspension/dropout (143/277 = 51.6%), and runaway (79/277= 28.5 %). For the family member group, the most common event was violence (25/ 61 = 40.9%) followed by arrest (13/61 = 21.3%). There was a significant difference in the presence of adverse events in family members that were randomized to BSFT trade; 44/721 (6.1%) when compared to Treatment as Usual 17/617 (2.8%) (p = 0.004). A probable explanation for this is that there were more opportunities to identify adverse events for family members assigned to BSFTtrade; because family members attended therapy sessions. This difference may also represent the risk for family members that participate in an evidence-based family intervention like BSFTtrade;. Limitations The utility of the principles outside of the BSFTtrade; trial is unknown. Conclusions Based on the events reported in this trial, the efforts for monitoring and categorizing adverse events appeared justified and appropriate. The strategies and principles described in this paper may be useful for those developing safety plans for behavioral intervention research, and to family therapy researchers for assessing the safety of behavioral family interventions.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Objectives: To measure the prevalence of HIV/AIDS risk behaviors and related factors in a large, probability-based sample of boys and girls aged 12-17 years living on the streets of Egypt's largest urban centers of Greater Cairo and Alexandria. Method(s): Time-location sampling (TLS) was used to recruit a cross-sectional sample of street children. Procedures entailed using key informants and field observation to create a sampling frame of locations at predetermined time intervals of the day, where street children congregate in the two cities, selecting a random sample of time-locations from the complete list, and intercepting children in the selected time-locations to assess eligibility and conduct interviews. Interviews gathered basic demographic information, life events on the street (including violence, abuse, forced sex), sexual and drug use behaviors, and HIV/AIDS knowledge. Result(s): A total of 857 street children were enrolled in the two cities, with an age, sex, and time-location composition matching the sampling frame. The majority of these children had faced harassment or abuse (93%) typically by police and other street children, had used drugs (62%), and, among the older adolescents, were sexually active (67%). Among the sexually active 15-17-year-olds, most reported multiple partners (54%) and never using condoms (52%). Most girls (53% in Greater Cairo and 90% in Alexandria) had experienced sexual abuse. The majority of street children experienced more than one of these risks. Overlaps with populations at highest risk for HIV were substantial, namely men who have sex with men, commercial sex workers, and injection drug users. Conclusion(s): Our study using a randomized TLS approach produced a rigorous, diverse, probability-based sample of street children and documented very high levels of multiple concurrent risks. Our findings strongly advocate for multiple services including those addressing HIV and STI prevention and care, substance use, shelters, and sensitization of authorities to the plight of street children in Egypt. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health  Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Y1  - 2010//
N2  - Objective: To examine the association between sexual health and internet use, including social networking websites such as MySpace and Facebook, among a sample of homeless adolescents at high risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. Method(s): In 2009, a survey of internet use among 201 homeless adolescents was carried out. Multivariate logistic regression models assessed how patterns of use were associated with engaging in exchange sex (sex for money, drugs, or housing), recent HIV testing, and online partner-seeking behaviors. Result(s): Among the surveyed adolescents, 96.5% reported internet use. Most youth accessed the internet at public libraries or youth service agencies. Increased time online and recent engagement in exchange sex were both positively associated with online partner-seeking. Youth connected to family members online were less likely to practice exchange sex and more likely to report a recent HIV test. Youth connected to street-based peers online were more likely to practice exchange sex, whereas youth connected to home-based peers online were more likely to report a recent HIV test. Conclusion(s): Although these data are preliminary, homeless youth need more access to the internet, as access facilitates connecting with family and home-based peers whose presence may reduce sexual risk-taking. Access, however, must be carefully monitored to prevent youth soliciting sex online. © 2010 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

T1  - Predictors of psychological adjustment among homeless and housed female youth
A1  - Votta E.
A1  - Farrell S. 
Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Objective: This cross-sectional study explored differences in the impact of self-reported coping style, self-esteem and perceived support on the psychological adjustment of homeless and housed female youth. Method(s): Data were obtained from homeless female youth (n = 72, M = 17.5 years) accessing an emergency shelter in a large Canadian urban centre and a comparison group of housed females (n = 102; M = 17.2 years) from local high schools who had never resided in a shelter. Result(s): Homeless youth reported lower self-worth, increased suicidal behaviour, less perceived parental support and higher levels of depressive symptoms and both internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems than housed youth. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that disengagement coping was a significant predictor of depressive symptoms and both internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems in homeless and housed youth. Conclusion(s): Findings reflect the merit of considering coping style, parental support and self-worth in the presentation of depressive symptoms and behaviour problems in homeless and housed female youth.

N2  - Homeless individuals often suffer from serious health problems. It has been argued that the homeless are socially isolated, with low levels of social support and social functioning, and that this lack of social resources contributes to their ill health. These observations suggest the need to further explore the relationship between social networks, social support, and health among persons who are homeless. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between multidimensional (cognitive/perceived and behavioral/received) social support and health outcomes, including physical health status, mental health status, and recent victimization, among a representative sample of homeless individuals in Toronto, Canada. Multivariate regression analyses were performed on social support and health outcome data from a subsample of 544 homeless adults, recruited from shelters and meal programs through multistage cluster sampling procedures. Results indicated that participants perceived moderately high levels of access to financial, emotional, and instrumental social support in their social networks. These types of perceived social supports were related to better physical and mental health status and lower likelihood of victimization. These findings highlight a need for more services that encourage the integration of homeless individuals into social networks and the building of specific types of social support within networks, in addition to more research into social support and other social contextual factors (e.g., social capital) and their influence on the health of homeless individuals. © 2009 The New York Academy of Medicine.

N2  - The goal of the current study was to identify potential individual and environmental protective factors for sex risk behavior among homeless youth. We explored gender differences in the prediction of unprotected sex and number of sex partners. Data were collected from 192 sexually active, homeless youth who were 14-21 years old. High rates of sex risk behavior were reported. Significant gender differences were found in STD rates with 19% of females and 2% of males reporting an STD diagnosis during the previous three months. Findings indicated that positive expectations for the future were associated with fewer sex partners for both genders, whereas decision making skills predicted a lower percentage of unprotected sex for males and fewer sex partners for females. For females, univariate analyses indicated that self-esteem and having a natural mentor may reduce the likelihood of unprotected sex, whereas multivariate analysis indicated that being employed or in school may play a protective role with respect to number of sex partners. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Background. Routine infant vaccination with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) began in the Calgary Health Region (Alberta, Canada) in 2002. We measured the impact of this vaccine program on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD).Methods. Prospective, population-based surveillance of all cases of IPD (with culture specimens obtained from sterile sites) was conducted from January 1998 through December 2007. Demographic and clinical data were collected. All viable isolates were saved and serotyped.Results. There were 1182 IPD cases over the 10-year period. Comparison of the vaccine period (2003-2007) with the prevaccine period (1998-2001) revealed that the incidence of IPD due to PCV7 serotypes decreased significantly by 86%, 59%, 38%, and 78% in the 6-23-month, 2-4-year, 16-64-year, and 65-84-year age groups, respectively. The total number of IPD cases decreased by 77%, 45%, and 34% in the 6-23-month, 2-4-year, and 65-84-year age groups, respectively. The incidence of IPD due to non-PCV7 serotypes increased by 183%, and the total incidence of IPD increased by 73% among adults aged 16-64 years; however, this increase was primarily attributed to a large outbreak of serotype 5 IPD among homeless adults during the period 2005-2007. There were 5 cases of IPD due to PCV7 serotypes among vaccinated children in the vaccine period.Conclusions. Since the introduction of PCV7 vaccine, there has been a profound decrease in the total number of cases of IPD among children and in cases due to PCV7 serotypes among subjects of all ages in Calgary, indicating a strong direct effect and herd effect of the vaccine. The serotypes that now cause IPD have changed significantly. The magnitude and impact of replacement IPD caused by non-PCV7 serotypes is not yet known. © 2009 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: A number of options for treatment are available to young drug users, but little is known about the youth who actually attempt to access such services. Here we identify characteristics of a cohort of street-involved youth and highlight commonly encountered barriers. Method(s): From September 2005 to July 2007, data were collected from the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), a prospective cohort of 529 drug users aged 14-26 living in Vancouver, Canada. Participants who attempted to access any addiction services in the 6 months prior to enrollment were compared in univariate analyses and multiple logistic regression modeling of socio-demographic and drug-related factors. Result(s): Factors positively associated with attempting to access services included Aboriginal ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.66 [1.05-2.62]), high school education (AOR = 1.66 [1.09-2.55]), mental illness (AOR = 2.25 [1.50-3.38]), non-injection crack use (AOR = 2.93 [1.76-4.89]), and spending >$50 on drugs per day (AOR = 2.13 [1.41-3.22]). Among those who experienced difficulty-accessing services, the most commonly identified barrier was excessively long waiting lists. In a subgroup analysis comparing those who tried to access services but were unsuccessful to those who were successful, risk factors positively associated with failure included drug bingeing (odds ratio [OR] = 2.86 [1.22-6.76]) and homelessness (OR = 3.86 [1.11-13.4]). Conclusion(s): In light of accumulating evidence that drug use among street youth is associated with risky health-related behaviors, improving access to treatment and other addiction services should remain an important public health priority. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

T1  - Violence in street culture: cross-cultural comparison of youth groups and criminal gangs
A1  - Zdun S. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Violence is a widespread phenomenon in juvenile street culture. But the questions of whether this relationship is a deterministic one, and if not, which are the contributing factors, are largely unanswered. This article focuses on the role of public space, starting with a comparison of the meaning of deviant behavior and crime in street culture in Brazil, Russia, and Germany. Focusing on street culture norms and their relevance for youth groups in everyday life, the author shows that there are worldwide similarities, and these are most likely to be seen in disadvantaged neighborhoods. The article deals not only with the question of how people act in conflicts but also focuses on a social order in which the reputation of men is based mainly on questions of masculinity, honor, and power expressed through aggressive behavior. The results are based on more than one hundred semistructured qualitative interviews with street culture youth, prison inmates, adult family members, social workers, police, and researchers that were conducted in recent years in the three countries.The study also describes a typology of conflict behavior among male street culture youth that helps in understanding why even juveniles who were socialized in the milieu of the street culture can reject violence and do not have to turn to violence in all conflicts. The article examines the similarities in the reasons for violence and fear of violence, as well as the differences in frequency and intensity between violent countries (such as Brazil and the Russian Federation) and less violent countries (for example, Germany).

T1  - A comparison of risk factors for sexual victimization among gay, lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual homeless young adults
A1  - Tyler K.A. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Although high rates of sexual victimization have been reported among homeless youth, less is known about whether the risk factors vary for gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth compared to heterosexual youth. Based on a sample of 172 homeless young adults ages 19 to 26, results revealed that depressive symptoms, prostitution, and having friends who traded sex were significantly associated with higher levels of sexual victimization. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual young adults experienced more sexual victimization compared to heterosexual young adults. A test for interactions revealed that the effect of sexual orientation on sexual victimization was moderated by trading sex and having friends who traded sex. Finally, there is support for partial mediation of the effects of sexual abuse, neglect, and depressive symptoms on sexual victimization through other risk factors. © 2008 Springer Publishing Company.

T1  - Effects of housing circumstances on health, quality of life and healthcare use for people with severe mental illness: A review
A1  - Kyle T.
A1  - Dunn J.R. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Individuals with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) identify housing as an important factor in achieving and maintaining their health. However, many live in substandard accommodations that are physically inadequate, crowded, noisy and located in undesirable neighbourhoods. In much of the research on housing for persons with SPMI, the central outcome of interest is remaining housed; however, it is worth investigating whether housing has other benefits. This paper is a systematic review of studies that investigated the relationship between housing-related independent variables and health-related dependent variables. Ten online databases were searched for studies published since 1980 that had study populations of adults with SPMI, analysed primary or secondary empirical data, and measured housing-related independent variables and health-related dependent variables. Clearly defined epidemiological criteria were used to assess the strength of evidence of the selected studies. Twenty-nine studies met the suitability criteria, of which 14 reported healthcare utilisation outcomes; 12 examined mental status outcomes; and 9 reported quality-of-life outcomes. The findings of the review suggest that there is good evidence that housing interventions benefit the homeless population; however more research is needed about housing solutions for individuals with SPMI who are housed, but in precarious or inappropriate housing situations. Study methodologies could be improved by emphasising longitudinal designs that focus on participant retention and by implementing matched control groups or randomised interventions to strengthen internal validity. Ensuring that a person is adequately housed upon discharge from hospital should be a treatment priority. When housing eligibility is not dependent on psychiatric treatment compliance and sobriety, providing permanent housing minimises harm and may free people to voluntarily seek treatment. Housing that offers an unlimited length of stay is recommended because SPMI is a chronic and fluctuating condition that requires stable surroundings to maintain health. © 2007 The Authors, Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Shelter data in a recent study revealed discharges from psychiatric facilities to shelters or the street occurred at least 194 times in 2002 in London, Ontario, Canada. This problem must be addressed to reduce the disastrous effects of such discharge, including re-hospitalization and prolonged homelessness. An intervention was developed and tested to prevent homelessness associated with discharge directly to no fixed address. A total of 14 participants at-risk of being discharged without housing were enrolled, with half randomized into the intervention group. The intervention group was provided with immediate assistance in accessing housing and assistance in paying their first and last month's rent. The control group received usual care. Data was collected from participants prior to discharge, at 31 and 6-months post-discharge. All the individuals in the intervention group maintained housing after 3 and 6 months. All but one individual in the control group remained homeless after 3 and 6 months. The exception joined the sex trade to avoid homelessness. The results of this pilot were so dramatic that randomizing to the control group was discontinued. Discussions are underway to routinely implement the intervention. Systemic improvements can prevent homelessness for individuals being discharged from psychiatric wards. © 2008 The Authors.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Methamphetamine use continues to be a significant problem for adolescents in Hawai'i, especially among Native Hawaiians and other Asian and Pacific Islanders. However, no research has compared the unique characteristics of these methamphetamine (MA) users to other substance users, which could contribute to enhanced treatment approaches. Utilizing a sample of adolescent treatment clients, this study compared those who have ever used and those who have never used methamphetamines on various domains. Results showed that girls were significantly more likely to use methamphetamines than other substances. Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders were more likely to use methamphetamines as well, although the difference was not statistically significant. MA users reported significantly more homelessness and prior treatment episodes. While no differences were found in arrest rates or days in jail/prison/juvenile detention in the past 90 days, MA users scored significantly higher on all self-reported crime indices. MA users also scored significantly higher on all substance problem and mental health indices, and reported significantly poorer health. Implications for future research and treatment are discussed.

N2  - Objective: To examine the associations between breastfeeding and child health outcomes among citizen infants of mothers immigrant to the United States. Design/methods: From September 1998 through June 2004, as part of the Children's Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program, a sentinel sample of 3,592 immigrant mothers with infants aged 0 to 12 months were interviewed in emergency departments or pediatric clinics in six sites. Mothers reported breastfeeding history, child health history, household demographics, government assistance program participation, and household food security. Infants' weight and length were recorded at the time of visit. Bivariate analyses identified confounders associated with breastfeeding and outcomes, which were controlled in logistic regression. Additional logistic regressions examined whether food insecurity modified the relationship between breastfeeding and child outcomes. Result(s): Eighty-three percent of infants of immigrants initiated breastfeeding. Thirty-six percent of immigrant households reported household food insecurity. After controlling for potential confounding variables, breastfed infants of immigrant mothers were less likely to be reported in fair/poor health (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50 to 0.85; P=0.001) and less likely to have a history of hospitalizations (AOR 0.72, CI 0.56 to 0.93, P=0.01), compared to nonbreastfed infants of immigrant mothers. Compared to nonbreastfed infants, the breastfed infants had significantly greater weight-for-age z scores (0.185 vs 0.024; P=0.006) and length-for-age z scores (0.144 vs -0.164; P<0.0001), but there was no significant difference in risk of overweight (weight-for-age >95th percentile or weight-for-length >90th percentile) between the two groups (AOR 0.94, CI 0.73 to 1.21; P=0.63). Household food insecurity modified the association between breastfeeding and child health status, such that the associations between breastfeeding and child health were strongest among food-insecure households. Conclusion(s): Breastfeeding is associated with improved health outcomes for infants of immigrant mothers. Breastfeeding is an optimal strategy in the first year of life to improve all infants' health and growth, especially for children of immigrants who are at greater risk for experiencing food insecurity. © 2007 American Dietetic Association.

N2  - Case histories of 147 patients with new-onset destructive pulmonary tuberculosis (PT) (infiltrative, disseminated, fibrocavernous) with the pathogen of the disease showing multidrug resistance (MDR) were analyzed, by evaluating the efficiency of treatment involving sputum abacillation after termination of the inpatient stage of treatment. A control group included 220 patients with PT of the similar lesion and clinical forms, who preserved drug resistance (DR) to antibacterial agents. Most patients with MDR disseminated destructive PT are young people aged 36.6 +/- 1.6 years, this disease-associated disabled individuals (65.3%), alcoholics (48.3%), opium addicts (11.5%), ex-prisoners (26.5%), single, homeless; more frequently suffer from gastrointestinal (40%) and chronic nonspecific lung (24.5%) diseases. The course of MDR PT is significantly more commonly complicated by the development of respiratory failure (48.9%) and hemoptysis (6.1%) (in DR PT 19.1 and 2.3%, respectively). In terms of negative smear tests and the results of sputum cultures, the abacillation rates were 70.1 and 67.3%, respectively (in DR PT, these were 88.18 and 86.34%, p = 0.01). A negative reaction of sputum occurred in 42.1% of patients at 2-3 months of treatment while its culture did in 46.2% at 4-5 months. In the control group wherein drug sensitivity of M. tuberculosis was preserved, sputum abacillation occurred in the larger proportion of the patients within the first 2 months (in 68.6 and 56.3% of cases with sputum smear and culture, respectively). The efficiency of inpatient therapy is greatly affected by short-term treatment caused by voluntary withdrawal and irregular uses of antituberculous drugs, mainly due to alcoholization.

N2  - Objectives. We compared health and social needs by gender, age, and race/ ethnicity of people leaving New York City jails and assessed the implication of these differences for the development of jail reentry programs. Methods. Surveys were completed with 1,946 individuals (536 men, 704 women, and 706 adolescent males) between 1997 and 2004. Structured questionnaires captured data on demographic, criminal justice, substance use, and health characteristics. Bivariate comparisons were performed to determine variations between men and women, men and male adolescents, and non-Latino black and Hispanic/Latino respondents. Results. The majority of participants were black and Hispanic/Latino, reported high levels of substance use, had high rates of recidivism, and experienced difficult living circumstances. Compared with men, women were more likely to be homeless, use illicit drugs, report drug charges at index arrest, have health problems, and be parents. Adolescent males were more likely than men to rely on illegal activities for income and to have used marijuana and alcohol recently, and were less likely to report homelessness or health problems. Ethnic/racial differences between black and Hispanic/Latino respondents within gender and age groups were smaller than differences among these groups. Conclusions. Jails concentrate individuals with multifaceted health and social problems, providing opportunities to engage at-risk populations in comprehensive reentry programs. Gender, age, and ethnic/racial differences among incarcerated populations require that interventions be tailored to the specific needs of these different groups. ©2007 Association of Schools of Public Health.

N2  - The current study examined differences between gang-involved and non-gang-involved homeless African American male youth with regard to negative affect, substance use, and antisocial/violent behavior. A total of 69 homeless African American young men were recruited from community agencies and completed structured face-to-face interviews. Overall, gang members reported higher rates of negative mental and physical health outcomes than did non-gang members, with current gang members reporting higher levels of depression and anxiety, greater levels of antisocial and violent behavior, and higher levels of lifetime alcohol and marijuana use. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that greater levels of gang involvement were associated with more frequent lifetime use of alcohol and marijuana and higher levels of participation in violent behaviors. Implications of these findings for interventions with homeless African American male youth and future research directions are discussed. © SAGE Publications, Inc. 2008.

N2  - Development of a global HIV vaccine will require enrollment of a large number of adults and adolescents in clinical trials. Involvement of homeless young adults in these trials will be particularly important because they often practice high-risk behaviors and are disproportionately infected by HIV. This qualitative study explores factors that might affect future participation of homeless 18- to 24-year-olds of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds in HIV vaccine trials (HIVVTs). Twenty males and females attended focus groups. Participants expressed concern about seroconversion, the trustworthiness of the researchers and/or government agencies conducting trials, vaccine side effects, and possible negative behavior change as a result of being vaccinated. Understanding the personal perspectives of high-risk young adults will enable researchers to tailor protocols to their individual needs and cultural values and, in so doing, potentially enhance willingness to participate in HIVVTs.

N2  - PROBLEM: Homeless families headed by young mothers are increasing. This preliminary study describes the characteristics of 17 homeless teenage mothers (HTM). METHOD(S): HTMs completed questionnaires researching depression, self-esteem, maternal competence, and sources of stress and support. FINDINGS: HTMs had positive maternal competence and self-esteem scores. When compared to housed mothers, HTMs were younger, had more depressive symptoms and negative life events, and fewer social supports. CONCLUSION(S): HTMs represent a high-risk group with fewer available supports and many complex life stressors. School-based programs can benefit HTMs by offering support, helping them continue their education, and assisting with on-site school-based childcare.

N2  - Homeless youth are at increased risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and HBV vaccine coverage is poor in this group. The purpose of our study was to determine if a shelter-based HBV vaccine program in children and adolescents 2-18 years of age with a randomized controlled trial using a culturally appropriate HBV video could increase HBV vaccine coverage rates. Subjects were randomized to an 8 min HBV video or a control, smoking prevention video. Before exposure to the videos, HBV knowledge, and demographics were assessed in caregivers and adolescents. HBV vaccine no. 1 was offered to all subjects who did not produce a vaccine record; subsequently, an accurate HBV vaccine history was obtained from medical providers. Subjects were asked to return 1 and 3 months after visit 1, HBV vaccine was offered to all with incomplete coverage, and HBV knowledge was reassessed. There were 328 children and adolescents cared for by 170 caregivers enrolled in the study. One hundred and four had incomplete HBV vaccine coverage. Data are reported for all family units with at least one subject needing vaccine. There were 53 children and adolescents randomized to the HBV video vs. 51 to the smoking video. HBV knowledge scores of caregivers improved at Visit no. 2 vs. no. 1 in the HBV video group (p=0.01) but not in the smoking group (p=0.82). Similar results were observed for adolescents in the HBV video group (p=0.05) but not in the smoking group (p=0.40). Exposure to the HBV video vs the smoking video had a significant effect on return rates for vaccine at Visit no. 2 (59 vs. 31%; p=0.05) but not at Visit no. 3 (47 vs. 18%, p=0.06). The shelter-based vaccine program was very effective in increasing HBV coverage rates in the entire group of 328 children and adolescents enrolled in the study, from 68% coverage at baseline to 85% at the conclusion of the study. We conclude that shelter-based HBV vaccine programs can be highly effective in increasing vaccine coverage rates in older children and adolescents. A brief exposure to a culturally appropriate HBV video improves HBV knowledge and may improve return rates for vaccine. © 2008 The New York Academy of Medicine.

T1  - Reading and phonological awareness skills in children exposed to domestic violence
A1  - Blackburn J.F. 
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - This study examined whether children exposed to domestic violence perform worse on tests of reading and phonological awareness than children from nonviolent homes. Forty children, ages 6 to 9 years, were divided into control or domestic violence groups based on their mothers' responses on the revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2). The groups were matched on age, gender, nonverbal IQ, and socioeconomic status. The domestic violence group performed worse than the control group on all measures of reading and phonological awareness. Significantly more children in the domestic violence group were identified as having reading difficulties compared to the control group. The results suggest that domestic violence may negatively impact children's reading skills, and appropriate intervention techniques should be developed. © 2008 by The Haworth Press.

N2  - The North American Opiate Medication Initiative (NAOMI) is a randomized controlled trial evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of heroin-assisted treatment (HAT) in the Canadian context. Our objective is to analyze the profile of the NAOMI participant cohort in the context of illicit opioid use in Canada and to evaluate its comparability with patient profiles of European HAT studies. Recruitment began in February 2005 and ended in March 2007. Inclusion criteria included opioid dependence, 5 or more years of opioid use, regular opioid injection, and at least two previous opiate addiction treatment attempts. Standardized assessment instruments such as the European Addiction Severity Index and the Maudsley Addiction Profile were employed. A total of 251 individuals were randomized from Vancouver, BC (192, 76.5%), and Montreal, Quebec (59, 23.5%); 38.5% were female, the mean age was 39.7 years (SD:8.6), and participants had injected drugs for 16.5 years (SD:9.9), on average. In the prior month, heroin was used a mean of 26.5 days (SD:7.4) and cocaine 16 days (SD;12.6). Vancouver had significantly more patients residing in unstable housing (88.5 vs. 22%; p<0.001) and higher use of smoked crack cocaine (16.9 days vs. 2.3 days in the prior month; p<0.001), while a significantly higher proportion of Montreal participants reported needle sharing in the prior 6 months (25% vs. 3.7%; p<0.001). In many respects, the patient cohort was similar to the European trials; however, NAOMI had a higher proportion of female participants and participants residing in unstable housing. This study suggests that the NAOMI study successfully recruited participants with a profile indicated for HAT. It also raises concern about the high levels of crack cocaine use and social marginalization. © 2008 The New York Academy of Medicine.

T1  - The impact of an integrated treatment on HIV risk behavior among homeless youth: A randomized controlled trial
A1  - Slesnick N.

Y1  - 2008//
N2  - While many studies provide useful information on the risk behaviors in which homeless youth engage, few prior studies evaluate Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) risk related reduction strategies. In this study, homeless youth (n = 180) were recruited from a drop-in center and randomly assigned to one of two conditions, either an integrated individual cognitive-behavioral treatment and HIV prevention intervention that focused on skills building and education or to treatment as usual. All youth were assessed at entry into the program and at 3 and 6 month follow-up points. Findings showed an interaction between treatment condition, age and time. In the interaction, youth assigned to the integrated treatment reported greater condom usage than youth assigned to treatment as usual, with younger youth assigned to treatment as usual showing no change in condom use. The number of sexual partners reported by youth in both treatment conditions was also reduced over time. However, youth in both conditions continued to engage in other high-risk behaviors. The integrated treatment findings are promising and suggest that interventions which target both HIV risk behavior in addition to other life areas (substance use, mental health and housing) among homeless youth may be necessary in order to significantly impact high-risk behaviors among this unique group. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - During 2002, an upsurge in frequency of hepatitis A outbreaks among injecting drug users was observed in England and Wales. As lack of risk factor information and the high mobility of the cases made linkage of outbreaks difficult, the relationship of nucleotide sequences in the VP1/2PA junction of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) genome amplified from serum of case-patients was investigated. A total of 204 HAV RNA positive sera obtained from a network of 23 laboratories were studied. Comparison of the sequences identified two principal strains: ES1 (n = 95) belonging to type IB, and ES2 (n = 72) to type IMA. Of the remaining samples, 15 were type IA, 11 were type IB and 11 were type IIIA. ES1 predominated in Doncaster and other towns in Trent and northern England, and ES2 in the Midlands and southern England; the difference in geographical distribution between these two strains was significant (P < 0.0001). In comparison to the sporadic cases, cases infected by either ES1 or ES2 tended to be younger, injecting drug users, people in contact with injecting drug users, or those with a history of incarceration in prisons or homelessness (P < 0.0001). Cases infected by ES1 tended to be younger than those by ES2 (P < 0.0001). The association of the outbreaks to two geographically restricted strains implicates two principal transmission pathways associated with injecting behavior. Identifying these routes may be conducive to preventing further outbreaks. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Background: New injection drug users (IDUs) are at high risk for blood-borne viral infections. Given U.S. policy to only fund proven-effective HIV prevention interventions, insights into conducting intervention trials among young IDUs are provided here by describing methods and participants' characteristics in the CIDUS III/DUIT study. Method(s): In 2002-2004, 15-30-year-old IDUs in Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle were recruited through community outreach, advertising and coupon-based participant referrals. Baseline interviews assessed sociodemographics, injection, and sexual behaviors. Antibody tests for HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses (HAV, HBV, and HCV) were conducted. IDUs who were HIV and HCV antibody negative at baseline were eligible to participate in a randomized controlled HIV/HCV prevention trial. Follow-up assessments were conducted 3 and 6 months post-intervention. Data were analyzed to identify participant differences at baseline by city, trial enrollment, and trial retention. Result(s): Baseline assessments were completed by 3285 IDUs. Participants were mean age 23.8 years, 69% male, 64% White, 17% Hispanic, and 8% Black. Seroprevalence of HIV, HCV, HBV, and HAV antibodies were 2.9, 34.4, 22.4, and 19.3%, respectively. Of the 2062 (62.7%) baseline participants who were HIV and HCV antibody negative, 859 (41.7%) were randomized. At least one follow-up assessment was completed by 712 (83%) randomized participants. Contextual factors, primarily homelessness, were associated with lower enrollment and retention. Conclusion(s): Recruitment and retention of young-adult IDUs for complex intervention trials is complicated, yet feasible. Risk behaviors among participants enrolling in and completing the trial reflected those eligible to enroll.

N2  - Homeless youth face various health challenges. The effectiveness of a short intervention to promote sexual health in 572 homeless 16-23-year-olds (M = 19.467+1.89) was conducted using a quasi-experimental repeated measures design. Data collected at three time points (pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention and follow-up) via laptop computers were analyzed using multivariate general linear mixed models. A significant condition by time interaction was found for self-reported AIDS/STD knowledge; intervention participants had higher scores at first post-test. Females scored significantly higher on cognitive and behavioral outcomes while males reported significantly more sexual risk-taking behaviors. Findings support gender-specific interventions.

N2  - Using cross-sectional analysis we examined residential status and associated differences in HIV risk behaviors among 3266 young IDUs enrolled in an HIV prevention trial. A three-level outcome (homeless (37%), equivocally housed (17%), housed (46%)) was defined based on responses to two questions assessing subjective and objective criteria for homelessness: "equivocally housed" participants were discordant on these measures. In multivariate analysis, antecedents of homelessness were having lived in an out-of-home placement, been thrown out of the home or in juvenile detention, and experienced childhood abuse; while correlates included receiving income from other and illegal sources, drinking alcohol or using methamphetamine at least daily, using shooting galleries, backloading, and sex work. A subset of these variables was associated with being equivocally housed. HIV risk varies by housing status, with homeless IDUs at highest risk. Programs for IDUs should utilize a more specific definition of residential status to target IDUs needing intervention. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

T1  - Personality and criminal outcomes of homeless youth in a Nigerian jail population: Results of PDS and MAACL-H assessments
A1  - Idemudia E.S. 
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Objective: The unprecedented incidence of armed robberies and the involvement of young people in these crimes necessitated - as part of a comprehensive study on homelessness and criminal behaviour In Nigeria - an assessmet and comparison of homeless youths incarcerated in prisons with a control group of non-prison and never-homeless youths from the general population using the Psychopathic Deviate Scale (PDS) and the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist hostility subscale (MAACL-H). Method(s): Through in-depth interviews using a questionnaire, data were collected from 100 randomly selected homeless inmates in three Nigerian medium-security prisons aged 15 to 26 (mean = 17.2), and another 100 non-prison and never-homeless youths from the general population aged 15 to 31 (mean = 25.2). Result(s): Hypothesis 1 showed a higher score on the PDS (mean = 29.3) and MAACL-H (mean = 21.7) among the homeless group than the non-prison and never homeless group (PDS mean = 21.2) and (MAACL-H = mean 12.5), (PDS (t = (98) = 6.62, < .05) and MAACL-H (t = (98) = 21.7, < .0001). The second hypothesis also showed a significant relationship between PDS and the type of crime committed by homeless inmates (F (2, 97) = 3.213; p < .05) and the direction of this relationship was higher for PDS and felony followed by misdemeanour offences (p < .05, LSD = 2.81). The MAACL-H did not reach an acceptable level of significance for type of crime. Conclusion(s): These findings have significant practical and theoretical implications for personality and criminal outcomes for homeless youths in prisons when compared with non-prison and never-homeless youths. The study also suggests the need for more research in this direction and a review of antiquated penal policies for children, while the effective roles of governments and non-governmental organisations were also stressed.

N2  - Comprehensive intervention for homeless, street living youth that addresses substance use, social stability, physical and mental health issues has received very little attention. In this study, street living youth aged 14-22 were recruited from a drop-in center and randomly assigned to the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) or treatment as usual (TAU) through a drop-in center. Findings showed that youth assigned to CRA, compared to TAU, reported significantly reduced substance use (37% vs. 17% reduction), depression (40% vs. 23%) and increased social stability (58% vs. 13%). Youth in both conditions improved in many other behavioral domains including substance use, internalizing and externalizing problems, and emotion and task oriented coping. This study indicates that homeless youth can be engaged into treatment and respond favorably to intervention efforts. However, more treatment development research is needed to address the barriers associated with serving these youth. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - A brief motivational intervention with 117 homeless adolescents was evaluated using a randomized design and 3-month follow-up. The intervention was designed to raise youths' concerns about their substance use, support harm reduction, and encourage greater service utilization at a collaborating agency. The study was designed to strengthen initial promising results of an earlier study (P. L. Peterson, J. S. Baer, E. A. Wells, J. A. Ginzler, & S. B. Garrett, 2006). Several modifications in the clinical protocol were included to enhance engagement with the intervention. Analyses revealed no significant benefits for intervention participants when homeless youths' substance use rates were compared with those of control participants. Service utilization during the intervention period increased for those receiving the intervention but returned to baseline levels at follow-up. Participants reported overall reductions in substance use over time. Differences between sampling methods for the current and previous study are discussed, as are the limitations of brief interventions with this population. Future research needs to elucidate mechanisms of change and service engagement for highly vulnerable youth. © 2007 American Psychological Association.

N2  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: Food insecurity, now listed among the social determinants of health, compromises the health and well-being of affected Australians. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of food insecurity within an urban population of social disadvantage in readiness for a local health promotion response. METHOD(S): This was a cross-sectional survey conducted in three disadvantaged locations of south-western Sydney. Prevalence of food insecurity was assessed using both the 16-item US Household Food Security Survey Module and the single-item question previously used in national Australian health surveys. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations between food insecurity and socio-demographic characteristics of the households. RESULT(S): The 16-item US tool yielded a significantly higher food insecurity prevalence (21.9%, 95% CI 20.0-23.8) than the single-item Australian tool (15.8%, 95% CI 14.1-17.5). Compared with the former, the single-item Australian tool has high specificity (96%) yet low sensitivity (56.9%). In our three sites, food insecurity was strongly and independently associated with household capacity to save money (AOR=5.05). Local fruit and vegetable production (83.8%), nutrition education (83.9%), transport to food outlets (81.5%) and better public transport overall (76.3%) were most highly rated by 'food insecure' households as useful future strategies. CONCLUSION(S): The higher sensitivity of the US 16-item food security survey module relative to the single-item Australian tool indicates its potential for use in future Australian surveys of food insecurity.

N2  - PURPOSE: Solitary maternity is a significant problem of modern times requiring socio-economic and psychological, as well as perinatological studies. The twentieth anniversary of the Maternity Home managed by the Benedictine Samaritan Sisters motivated the present study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Hospital discharge summaries of 429 women (group DSM) who lived at the Maternity Home between 26 July 1983 and 26 February 2002 were analyzed. This documentation was supplemented with hospital data on 177 women who gave birth at two Szczecin hospitals and on 13 who left the Home before delivery. RESULT(S): Residents of the Home came from all regions of Poland and from urban and rural societies. They were between 14 and 43 years of age (mean 22.6 +/- 5.7). 87.4% of them were single and 63.7% were primipara. 50.4% of them failed to complete primary education while 3.4% had university-level education. 6% were mentally and/or psychologically handicapped and 42.7% had no profession. The major causes of admission into the Home were: desire to hide the pregnancy, family conflicts, homelessness, difficult material situation, mental or physical disability, violence or alcoholism in the family. The control group comprised 400 women (group K) who gave birth at the Department of Obstetrics and Perinatology, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin. 51.5% of them were primipara. The mean age in this group was 27.4 +/- 5.4 (17-44). 71.3% were married. The Majority had secondary (41.9%) or university (32.5%) education. Most of them worked as artisans, teachers or economists. Neurological or psychiatric diseases dominated in group DSM but otherwise no severe disease at all could be disclosed. Satisfactory prenatal care was provided to 33.1% of DSM patients and to 78% of group K. No prenatal care was provided to 9.5% of DSM patients and to 1.7% of group K. EPH gestosis was more often observed in DSM patients and imminent abortion, premature birth, PROM, urinary tract infection, and anaemia were more frequent in controls. More DSM patients had no treatment during pregnancy than controls. The use of tocolytics was significantly more frequent in DSM patients. Antibiotics and drugs accelerating maturation of the respiratory system were applied with similar frequency in both groups. Frequency of immature and mature births was similar in both groups. 84.2% of DSM patients and 68.8% of controls had natural delivery. Cesarian section was twice more frequent in group K. Immediate indications dominated in both groups (74.1% in DSM; 57.4% in K). No medication was used during delivery in 30% of patients. DSM patients more often required strong analgesics. Antibiotics and agents increasing uterine tension more often were used in K patients. Deliveries in both groups were usually without complications. Female genital tract injury was more frequent in DSM patients (20.9% in DSM; 14.8% in K). Delivery duration was similar in both groups, but the second part of delivery was longer in K primipara. Mean neonatal weight in the 1000-2500 g range was similar in both groups but was significantly higher in controls for 2501-4000 g neonates. The difference for newborns weighing more than 4000 g was not significant. There were no neonates weighing less than 1000 g. The clinical condition of newborns measured with the Apgar scale was worse in the DSM group after the 1st min, as well as after the 3rd and 5th min and the difference in each case was significant. Puerperium was usually uncomplicated. However, urinary tract infection was more frequent in DSM patients and anaemia was more frequent in controls. The duration of hospitalisation was similar in both groups (mean = 6 days). 120 of 177 DSM mothers left hospital together with their children, as compared to 99.3% in the control group. 87 children of mothers from the Maternity Home were offered for adoption. CONCLUSION(S): By studying unwed maternity it was observed that a holistic approach is the only way to disclose all the problems which are often unusually complex and concealed but which determine the normal development of an individual in the society. Analysis of the factors involved may help in attaining goals that serve the good of the society.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Recently, a short-course treatment using 60 daily doses of rifampin and pyrazinamide was recommended for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI). STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the acceptability, tolerability, and completion of treatment. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Five county jails and TB outreach clinics for homeless populations in three cities. PATIENTS: Study staff enrolled 1,211 patients (844 inmates and 367 homeless persons). INTERVENTIONS: Sites used 60 daily doses of rifampin and pyrazinamide, an approved treatment regimen for LTBI. MEASUREMENTS: Types and frequency of drug-related adverse events and outcomes of treatment. RESULT(S): Prior to treatment, 25 of 1,178 patients (2.1%) had a serum aminotransferase measurement at least 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. Patients who reported excess alcohol use in the past 12 months were more likely than other patients to have an elevated pretreatment serum aminotransferase level (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.1; p = 0.03). Treatment was stopped in 66 of 162 patients (13.4%) who had a drug-related adverse event. Among 715 patients who had serum aminotransferase measured during treatment, 43 patients (6.0%) had an elevation > 5 times the upper limits of normal, including one patient who died of liver failure attributed to treatment. In multivariate analyses, increasing age, an abnormal baseline aspartate aminotransferase level, and unemployment within the past 24 months were independent risk factors for hepatotoxicity. Completion rates were similar in jail inmates (47.5%) and homeless persons (43.6%). CONCLUSION(S): This study detected the first treatment-associated fatality with the rifampin and pyrazinamide regimen, prompting surveillance that detected unacceptable levels of hepatotoxicity and retraction of recommendations for its routine use. Completion rates for LTBI treatment using a short-course regimen exceeds historical rates using isoniazid. Efforts to identify an effective short-course treatment for LTBI should be given a high priority.

N2  - Aim: To determine the oral health status of street children and compare the results with a group of non-working children in Adana, Turkey. Street children are generally defined as any boy or girl for whom the street has become his or her habitual abode and/or source of livelihood; and who is inadequately protected, supervised, or directed by responsible adults. Study design: Demographic data including education, employment and social insurance of parents and number of siblings, was obtained. A formal interview with structured questions was used in order to determine the oral health behaviour of the children. Oral examinations were performed according to the criteria of the WHO oral examination form. Result(s): The oral health behaviour of street children was significantly different from non-working children. While DMFT and dmft scores of the street youths were significantly lower than the control group, they had higher CPITN scores (p<=0.001). Conclusion(s): Street children are commonly faced with oral health problems, especially periodontal problems. Therefore, the dental and periodontal needs of this particular population must be addressed. Oral health policies and preventive services including oral health promotion programmes which aim to give information about dental issues and to make positive changes in behavioural and environmental factors should be developed. The priority should be to control the factors which result in the occurrence of new dental problems. © 2006 FDI/World Dental Press.

N2  - Although the importance of medical research for the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases is unquestionable, the use of human subjects, however, still presents a complex ethical problem. Moral difficulties occur in particular when the medical research deals with vulnerable subjects. Vulnerable individuals are defined as those who experience diminished actual autonomy. Among the groups which should be considered as being vulnerable are usually listed the following: children, pregnant women, mentally or emotionally disabled, physically disabled, homeless, and institutionalized people. This study addresses key concerns that gave rise to the question of whether unemployed people had to be recognized as vulnerable subjects. The term "vulnerability" was clarified and it was assumed that the "vulnerability" of medical research subjects' had to be understood as a form of continuum from potential, through the circumstantial, temporal, episodic, permanent to inevitable vulnerability. The conclusion was drawn that unemployed people were, at least, potentially vulnerable subjects. Research involving unemployed people presents important moral challenges to researchers and should be undertaken very carefully, following special ethical guidelines.

T1  - Predictors of substance use and family therapy outcome among physically and sexually abused runaway adolescents

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - There is a dearth of research that examines the impact of family systems therapy on problems among sexually and/or physically abused youth. Given this void, differential outcome and predictors of substance use change were evaluated for abused, as compared with nonabused, runaway adolescents who were randomly assigned to family therapy or treatment as usual. Abused adolescents reported lower family cohesion at baseline, although both abused and nonabused adolescents showed similar substance use reductions. Utilizing hierarchical linear modeling, we found that substance use changed with change in cohesion over time. These findings link change in family functioning to change in adolescent substance use, supporting family systems theory. Findings suggest that a potent target of intervention involves focus on increasing positive communication interactions.

T1  - Comparison of context-based interaction patterns of mothers who are homeless with their preschool children
A1  - O'Neil-Pirozzi T.M. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Purpose: The primary purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the influence of context on interaction patterns used by mothers who are homeless with their preschool children during book-reading and game-playing activities. The impact of mothers' previously determined language functioning on their contextual use of facilitating language utterances was also examined. Method(s): Using a prospective, nonrandomized, comparison group design, mothers read a book and played a game with their preschool children. Facilitating language utterances produced by the mothers in 16 mother-child dyads during each activity were analyzed. Result(s): Regardless of their language functioning, no significant contextual differences in percentage use of facilitating language utterances were found across mothers. Overall maternal use of facilitating utterances was less than 50%. Across both contexts, mothers used few different types of facilitating language utterances. Conclusion(s): This exploratory study provides initial evidence of overall consistency of facilitating language utterance use by mothers who are homeless during interactions with their preschool children across contexts, regardless of maternal language functioning. This study provides an initial framework for future research investigating the interactions of families who are homeless and discusses possible language interventions for these at-risk families. © American Speech-Language- Hearing Association.

T1  - Diphtheria morbidity in Russia today
A1  - Markina S.S.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - The data on diphtheria morbidity and the occurrence of carrier state for its causative agent at the period of 2001-2002 were analyzed. The rates of morbidity and detected carrier state for these years were 0.63-0.55 and 0.65-0.64 respectively. Nevertheless, in spite of the relatively low morbidity rates the presence of the toxic forms of diphtheria (400 patients for two years) and lethal cases (with lethality rate reaching 5.4%) indicated that the epidemic situation in diphtheria remained tense. The most unfavorable situation was observed in the North-Western and Central regions of Russia. In urban areas morbidity rates were still 2- to 3-fold higher in than in rural ones, but the latter showed a higher percentage of severe cases (46.6% in 2001 and 39.7% in 2002) and lethal outcomes (13.6% and 19.2%). The latter was indicative of drawbacks in the immunoprophylaxis, diagnostics and treatment of diphtheria in rural areas. In the total structure of diphtheria patients adults prevailed: 75%. The highest morbidity rates were registered among children aged 3-6 years, among adults in the age groups of 18-19 years and 50-59 years. The epidemic process developed mainly among the immunized population, which was indicated by a high proportion of vaccinated persons among those affected by this infection (62.8-66.6%) and a mild course of the disease in the majority of them. The present epidemiological situation in diphtheria was determined by patients not vaccinated against this infection. The proportion of severe cases among nonvaccinated children was 42.4-51.6% and lethal outcomes, 12.9-15.1%. Among nonimmunized adults these figures were equal to 43.1% and 9.3% respectively. The highest percentage of children, not vaccinated during the first years of their life, was registered among those in the asocial families, refugees and homeless persons. Among adults these were persons above 50 years old, as well as jobless persons of working age, pensioners and invalids, who had limited possibilities of undergoing vaccination due to their social position. It was these social and age groups that should be regarded as risk groups with respect to the severity of the course of diphtheria and lethality. To stabilize diphtheria morbidity, the full complex of prophylactic and antiepidemic measures, and primarily the immunization of the population, should be systematically carried out.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - It had been examined 896 inmates of Infant Homes whose mothers resided during pregnancy in different housing conditions. Comparative analysis revealed discrepancies in many medical social indicators. It was found that mothers' habitation lacking was the most pathogenic factor impacting children development. Typically, this factor is associated with lower education, lack of labour employment, toxicomania and socially significant infections. It wes revealed that children of homeless mothers had higher rate of antenatal and postnatal development delay, alcoholic and drug lesion of nervous system. The utterly low possibility of returning to their biological family had been also established

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Extrafamilial sexual abuse experiences of young adolescents (ages 10-14), particularly young teen boys, are not well studied. This retrospective chart review study compared psychosocial correlates and victimization experiences between young adolescent girls (n = 226) and boys (n = 64) referred to a hospital child advocacy center. Several differences in risk behaviors and abuse experiences were found: Girls were more likely to have run away, to be truant from school, to report substance use, to have multiple perpetrators, and to have physical findings from the abuse. Boys were more likely to have a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder and to report anal penetration, and rarely disclosed abuse at the time of the incident. Peers were girls' most common choice for disclosing abuse, whereas boys confided most often in their mothers or other adults. These findings suggest sexually abused young adolescent girls and boys need distinct, developmentally appropriate screening and care in school and health care settings.

T1  - Factors Associated with Future Offending: Comparing Youth in Grandparent-Headed Homes with those in Parent-Headed Homes
A1  - Campbell L.R.

A1  - Oberle S. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - This study examined risk factors for reoffending by youth in grandparent-headed homes and those in parent-headed homes. Using data abstracted from the juvenile justice records of youth in a variety of living arrangements, we compared the records of 29 youth living in grandparent-headed homes with those of 37 youth living in parent-headed homes. Youth in grandparent-headed homes were significantly more likely to have risk factors and needs associated with reoffending. The findings suggest that youth in grandparent-headed homes are at greater risk for reoffending and that factors predisposing youth in grandparent-headed homes to reoffend may differ from those that predispose youth in non-grandparent-headed homes. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Despite the increase in consumer-driven interventions for homeless and mentally ill individuals, there is little evidence that these programs enhance psychological outcomes. This study followed 197 homeless and mentally ill adults who were randomized into one of two conditions: a consumer-driven "Housing First" program or "treatment as usual" requiring psychiatric treatment and sobriety before housing. Proportion of time homeless, perceived choice, mastery, and psychiatric symptoms were measured at six time points. Results indicate a direct relationship between Housing First and decreased homelessness and increased perceived choice; the effect of choice on psychiatric symptoms was partially mediated by mastery. The strong and inverse relationship between perceived choice and psychiatric symptoms supports expansion of programs that increase consumer choice, thereby enhancing mastery and decreasing psychiatric symptoms. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Many persons with HIV infection do not receive consistent ambulatory medical care and are excluded from studies of patients in medical care. However, these hard-to-reach groups are important to study because they may be in greatest need of services. OBJECTIVE(S): This study compared the sociodemographic, clinical, and health care utilization characteristics of a multisite sample of HIV-positive persons who were hard to reach with a nationally representative cohort of persons with HIV infection who were receiving care from known HIV providers in the United States and examined whether the independent correlates of low ambulatory utilization differed between the 2 samples. METHOD(S): We compared sociodemographic, clinical, and health care utilization characteristics in 2 samples of adults with HIV infection: 1286 persons from 16 sites across the United States interviewed in 2001-2002 for the Targeted HIV Outreach and Intervention Initiative (Outreach), a study of underserved persons targeted for supportive outreach services; and 2267 persons from the HIV Costs and Services Utilization Study (HCSUS), a probability sample of persons receiving care who were interviewed in 1998. We conducted logistic regression analyses to identify differences between the 2 samples in sociodemographic and clinical associations with ambulatory medical visits. RESULT(S): Compared with the HCSUS sample, the Outreach sample had notably greater proportions of black respondents (59% vs. 32%, P = 0.0001), Hispanics (20% vs. 16%), Spanish-speakers (9% vs. 2%, P = 0.02), those with low socioeconomic status (annual income <$10,000 75% vs. 45%, P = 0.0001), the unemployed, and persons with homelessness, no insurance, and heroin or cocaine use (58% vs. 47%, P = 0.05). They also were more likely to have fewer than 2 ambulatory visits (26% vs. 16%, P = 0.0001), more likely to have emergency room visits or hospitalizations in the prior 6 months, and less likely to be on antiretroviral treatment (82% vs. 58%, P = 0.0001). Nearly all these differences persisted after stratifying for level of ambulatory utilization (fewer than 2 vs. 2 or more in the last 6 months). In multivariate analysis, several variables showed significantly different associations in the 2 samples (interacted) with low ambulatory care utilization. The variables with significant interactions (P values for interaction shown below) had very different adjusted odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) for low ambulatory care utilization: age greater than 50 (Outreach 0.55 [0.35-0.88], HCSUS 1.17 [0.65-2.11)], P = 0.05), Hispanic ethnicity (Outreach 0.81 [0.39-1.69], HCSUS 2.34 [1.56-3.52], P = 0.02), low income (Outreach 0.73 [0.56-0.96], HCSUS 1.35 [1.04-1.75], P = 0.002), and heavy alcohol use (Outreach 1.74 [1.23-2.45], HCSUS 1.00 [0.73-1.37], P = 0.02). Having CD4 count less than 50 was associated with elevated odds of low ambulatory medical visits in the Outreach sample (1.53 [1.00-2.36], P = 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): Compared with HCSUS, the Outreach sample had far greater proportions of traditionally vulnerable groups, and were less likely to be in care if they had low CD4 counts. Furthermore, heavy alcohol use was only associated with low ambulatory utilization in Outreach. Generalizing from in care populations may not be warranted, while addressing heavy alcohol use may be effective at improving utilization of care for hard-to-reach HIV-positive populations. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - This study examined the effects of cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBT) on the self-esteem, depression, and self-efficacy of runaway adolescents residing in a shelter in Seoul, South Korea. The study used a control group pretest-posttest design. The experimental group and the control group consisted of 14 and 13 male subjects, respectively, with subjects having been randomly assigned to these groups. The experimental group participated in a CBT that consisted of eight sessions over an 8-week period; the control group did not participate in the program. To examine the effects of the CBT on dependent variables, the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used. The scores on depression decreased significantly (z = -2.325, p = .02) and those on self-efficacy increased significantly (z = -2.098, p = .03) after the intervention in the experimental group. There was no significant change on self-esteem (z = -1.19, p = .23). In the control group, the scores on depression, self-esteem, and self-efficacy did not change significantly after the intervention period. The CBT developed in this study consisted of structured and specific content that could be usefully applied to runaway adolescents residing in a shelter. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Homeless Adolescent Mothers: A Metasynthesis of Their Life Experiences
A1  - Meadows-Oliver M. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - The purpose of this article was to synthesize the findings of six qualitative studies on homeless adolescent mothers. Metasynthesis was conducted using the meta-ethnographic approach of Noblit and Hare [Noblit, G., & Hare, R. (1988). Meta-ethnography: Synthesizing qualitative studies. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications]. Six reciprocal translations illuminating the experiences of homeless adolescent mothers emerged: being homeless, enduring abuse, lamenting lost years, searching for support, recreating self, and seeking a better life. The findings may be used by nurses working with this population as the basis for a framework of intervention strategies directed toward helping these mothers cope with their dual transitions into motherhood and adulthood while simultaneously being homeless. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Indian scientists have not yet used 20-meter multi stage shuttle run test (20-m MST) and studies on the validity of the test for use with any of the Indian population are scanty. The purpose of the study was to validate the applicability of the 20-m MST in trainee badminton players of Kolkata, India. For application of direct method cross over design (random sequencing) was followed. For validity of the results repeatability was used. 32 trainee badminton players (age range 12~17 years, sex- male) from different sports academies of Kolkata were recruited for the study. Direct estimation of Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) comprised of treadmill exercise followed by expired gas analysis by scholander micro-gas analyzer, whereas VO2 max was indirectly predicted by 20-m MST. The difference between the mean (+/- Standard Deviation) VO2 max values of direct measurement (VO2 max = 46.90 +/- 4.13 ml/kg/min) and the 20-m MST (SPVO2 max = 46.21 +/- 3.94 ml/kg/min) was statistically significant (p<0.01). The results suggest that the application of the present form of 20-m MST be not justified in the studied population. For better prediction of VO2 max a new equation has been developed based on present data. © Publication of Indian Association of Biomedical Scientists.

N2  - Aims: This paper examines differences between early- and late-onset injection drug users (12-16 years versus 17-24 years) in terms of the antecedents and circumstances of first injection. Design(s): Cross-sectional retrospective design, using logistic regression. Setting(s): Australia: Sydney, Brisbane, rural New South Wales. Participant(s): A total of 336 injection drug users aged 16-25 years at the time of interview. Measurements: Independent variables included family injection drug use, homelessness and other demographic variables, drugs used prior to the first injection, length of pre-injection drug career, behaviours at time of first injection (e.g. drug injected, reasons/motives for the first injection, risk behaviours). Finding(s): Early-onset injection was associated independently with: having a family who injected drugs, having left school early, an unreliable source of income, a short pre-injection drug career, planning of the first injection, reliance on others for administration of the first injection and denial that experimentation was the motive for the first injection. In bivariate analysis, early-onset injection was associated further with: homelessness, being an Indigenous Australian, omission of use of certain pre-injection drugs, group presence at first injection, reliance on others for acquisition of the first needle and syringe and having injected the first time because an injection was offered. Conclusion(s): The research shows that early-onset, compared with late-onset injectors, are more likely to have an immediate family who inject drugs and other problematic beginnings in early life. They have an accelerated transition to injection, and differences in autonomy and motivation at first injection. These characteristics may make them more vulnerable to risk taking. © 2006 The Authors.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To compare directly observed treatment (DOT) of tuberculosis through pharmacy offices with self-administered treatment (SAT) in patients at risk for non-adherence. METHOD(S): Prospective study for DOT (1999-2002) and retrospective study for SAT (1996-1998) in patients at risk for non-adherence (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection, alcoholism, illicit drug use, immigrant or homeless status and/or previous failure to complete). Patients in the DOT programme received medication as out-patients twice a week in pharmacies that supervised adherence and provided socio-sanitary support to patients. RESULT(S): There were 101 and 112 patients in the DOT and SAT groups, respectively. Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in both groups. Differences were observed in risk factors for non-adherence (more immigrants and fewer intravenous drug users in the DOT vs. the SAT groups; P < 0.05). In the DOT group, 76 patients (75.2%) completed treatment and were cured compared to only 30 patients (26.7%) in the SAT group (P < 0.001). Implementation of DOT increased the cost of treatment by 400 per patient compared to SAT. CONCLUSION(S): In patients at risk for non-adherence, DOT implemented through pharmacy offices was better than SAT; however, completion rates were still low. © 2006 The Union.

N2  - Purpose: Recent increases in Hmong girls referred to a Midwest hospital-based child advocacy center prompted this comparison of abuse experiences for Hmong extra-familial sexual abuse cases versus peers. Method(s): Retrospective chart review of all girls, aged 10 to 14 years, with extra-familial sexual abuse 1998-2003 (n = 226). Fourteen percent of cases were Hmong (n = 32). Demographics, risk behaviors, abuse experiences, physical findings and legal outcomes were compared for Hmong (H) and Other (O) girls using chi-square. Multivariate logistic regressions explored differences in gynecologic findings and sexually transmitted disease (STD) results. Result(s): Hmong girls were more likely to be runaways (90% H vs. 8% O), truant (97% H vs. 13% O), self-mutilating (38% H vs. 10% O), and suicidal (41% H vs. 21% O). Seventy-seven percent of Hmong reported gang rape, prostitution, or multiple assaults versus 16% Others; most had 5+ perpetrators (69% H vs. 2% O) and 5+ assaults (75% H vs. 24% O, both p < .001). Gynecologic findings were more prevalent among Hmong girls (63% H vs. 21% O). Controlling for penetration, number of partners/assaults, and acuity at examination, Hmong ethnicity predicted gynecologic findings (adjusted odds ration [AOR] = 6.57). Hmong girls were more likely to have a positive chlamydia screen (36% H vs. 4% O, p < .001), but only number of perpetrators was an independent predictor (AOR = 15.09). Most cases were prosecuted, but Hmong had higher prosecution rates (83% H vs. 57% O, p < .001). Conclusion(s): Hmong girl assault experiences were markedly more severe than peers. Health care providers need appropriate knowledge of Hmong culture to conduct forensic examinations. Abused Hmong girls need culturally sensitive, developmentally appropriate after-care that helps connect them back with families and school. © 2006 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

N2  - The health and social conditions of women living in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside has recently been the focus of substantial international attention. Since few studies have examined rates and correlates of death among addicted women in Canada, we have characterized patterns of mortality among female injection drug users (IDUs) in Vancouver. The Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS) is a prospective open cohort study of IDUs. The analyses presented here, were restricted to women enrolled between May 1996 and May 2002 and who were aged 14 years or older. We estimated cumulative mortality rates using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression was used to calculate univariate and adjusted relative hazards. Between May 1996 and May 2002, 520 female IDUs have been recruited from the Vancouver area among whom 68 died during the study period. Elevated rates of mortality were observed among those who reported, baseline sex-trade involvement, those with HIV-infection at baseline, and those who lived in unstable housing at baseline (all log-rank: p < 0.05). In adjusted analyses, HIV infection (RH = 3.09 [95% CI: 1.86-5.11]; p < 0.001), unstable housing (RH = 1.74 [95% CI: 1.10-2.86]; p = 0.029) and sex-trade involvement (RH = 1.82 [95% CI: 0.95-3.45]; p = 0.071) were associated with the time to death. When the number of observed deaths was compared to the number of expected deaths based on the general female population of British Columbia using indirect standardization, the rate of death among female IDUs was elevated by a factor of 47.3 (95% CI: 36.1-58.5). In Vancouver, female IDUs have rates of mortality almost 50 times that of the province's female population. Our findings are consistent with a growing number of reports from other settings internationally, and demonstrate the need for an appropriate evidence-based strategy to address the health and social needs of addicted women. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Problem: Various demographic and familial risk factors have been linked to runaway behavior. To date, there has not been a systematic investigation of the impact of size of community on runaway behavior. This study will compare runaways from smaller cities and rural areas to their urban counterparts. Method(s): A convenience sample of 602 adolescents was interviewed between 1995 and August of 1996 in Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas, USA. Multiple regression was used to examine the association between gender, neglect, sexual abuse, physical abuse, geographic and family structure change, and community size of first runaway to predict age at first runaway, deviant subsistence strategies, and street victimization. Result(s): Findings indicate that adolescents exposed to neglect (beta = -.20) and sexual abuse (beta = -.16) ran away sooner and were more likely to be victimized on the street. Rural adolescents who experienced higher levels of physical abuse relied more heavily on deviant subsistence strategies (beta = .15) and remained in abusive homes longer (beta = .15) than their similarly situated urban counterparts. Conclusion(s): Rural youth who have been subjected to elevated levels of familial abuse are at greater risk of deviant subsistence strategies, which increase the likelihood of street victimization. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - The after-school occupations of homeless youth: Three narrative accounts
A1  - McDonald A.E. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - This study describes the after-school and weekend time use of young adolescents residing in a temporary shelter for homeless families in Los Angeles County. Data were collected from three individual interviews, focus groups with 24 young adolescents and one-week time use journals. Data were analyzed qualitatively using the constant comparative method. Three narrative profiles were constructed from these data. Emergent themes and concepts describing the occupational participation of young adolescents during the non-school hours were summarized into three major concepts. These were the following: (a) Occupational Necessity: Social Intensity; (b) Boredom and Shelter Living: Occupational Advantages and Disadvantages; and, (c) Designing a Life: Taking Control. Implications for occupational science, occupational therapy, and public policy were identified with relevant recommendations. Copyright © by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Examination of differences between primary alcohol and drug abusing adolescents can provide valuable direction to intervention efforts, though little research in this area has been conducted. The current study compared primary alcohol and primary drug abusing runaway adolescents who were randomly assigned to family therapy or treatment as usual. Baseline differences, as well as response to treatment, were examined separately for alcohol and drug use and by gender. Although few baseline differences were found, hierarchical linear modeling indicated that alcohol and drug abusing male and female adolescents responded differently to therapy. Primary drug using males showed poorer alcohol use outcomes than did primary alcohol abusers. Specifically, alcohol use increased for primary drug using males receiving family therapy, while drug use decreased in all groups. Findings suggest that alcohol and drug use outcomes might be improved at treatment planning through consideration of client's gender and primary alcohol versus drug use. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The short-term results of a randomized trial testing a brief feedback and motivational intervention for substance use among homeless adolescents are presented. Homeless adolescents ages 14-19 (N = 285) recruited from drop-in centers at agencies and from street intercept were randomly assigned to either a brief motivational enhancement (ME) group or 1 of 2 control groups. The 1-session motivational intervention presented personal feedback about patterns of risks related to alcohol or substance use in a style consistent with motivational interviewing. Follow-up interviews were conducted at 1 and 3 months postintervention. Youths who received the motivational intervention reported reduced illicit drug use other than marijuana at 1-month follow-up compared with youths in the control groups. Treatment effects were not found with respect to alcohol or marijuana. Post hoc analyses within the ME group suggested that those who were rated as more engaged and more likely to benefit showed greater drug use reduction than did those rated as less engaged. Limitations of the study are discussed as are implications for development of future substance use interventions for this high-risk group. Copyright 2006 by the American Psychological Association.

N2  - The purpose of this descriptive study was to explore the protective processes of Latina adolescents in the United States. Thirty Latina participants aged 15-19 self-administered an adolescent risk assessment event history calendar (EHC) as part of a clinical feasibility study. The 6- 10 year temporal- and context-linked EHC histories of girls who did not report sexual intercourse and substance use were compared with the EHC data of girls who did report these behaviors. Descriptive statistics and the constant comparative method of analysis revealed that both groups of girls had protective processes, but number, type, and patterns varied by group and over time. During school age years, the girls in both groups reported academic achievement and participation in activities/sports, but during adolescence, girls with risk behaviors were more likely to report school failure and dropout of school and activities, Throughout school age and adolescence, girls with no risk behaviors were more likely to report family presence and mentoring, and goals for college. Implications for protection-focused clinical work with Latina adolescents are included. © 2006 Springer Publishing Company.

T1  - A comparison of the socioeconomic characteristics, dietary practices, and health status of women food shoppers with different food price attitudes
A1  - Bowman S.A. 
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - A person's attitude toward food price could influence food purchase decisions and, consequently, impact diet quality. The aim of the study was to compare soicoeconomic, dietary, and health status of women food shoppers who considered food price very important (n = 1322) with those of women who did not consider food price very important (n = 1272). These women planned and prepared their household meals. Data from US Department of Agriculture's Diet and Health Knowledge Survey, 1994 to 1996, and Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals, 1994 to 1996, were used. The socioeconomic characteristics, dietary intakes, fat reduction practices, and health status were estimated. A priori, pairwise mean comparisons, at alpha = .05 level of significance, were made. Food price was very important to 46.8% of women. More African-American and Hispanic women food shoppers were likely to consider food price very important when buying food. The women who considered food price very important were more likely to live in low-income, food-insecure households; receive food stamps; have low education; rent and not own homes; and be employed as service workers. They consumed 17 kJ less energy. Yet, the energy density of their diet was 11 kJ/kg more than that of the other group. They ate a low amount of relatively high-price foods like nonstarchy vegetables and drank more sweetened fruit drinks that are an inexpensive source of energy. A low percentage of them adopted dietary fat reduction strategies and read food labels. They are more likely to be overweight and have health conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes than the others. Dietitians working with low-income food shoppers should address cost-effective ways to buy seasonally available fruits and vegetables and promote dietary fat reduction strategies. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Adult health and social outcomes of children who have been in public care: population-based study
A1  - Viner R.M.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Objective. To examine adult socioeconomic, educational, social, and health outcomes of being in public care in childhood. Methods. The 1970 British birth cohort was followed up at 5 (N = 13 135), 10 (14 875), 16 (11 622), and 30 years (11 261). Cases were defined as those ever in statutory or voluntary public care at 5, 10, and 16 years. Self-reported adult outcomes were occupation, educational achievement, general health, psychological morbidity, history of homelessness, school exclusion, and convictions. Results. A total of 343 (3.6%) of 9557 had been in public care <17 years. Nonwhite children were more likely to have been in care (odds ratio [OR]: 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.1-5.4). Controlling for socioeconomic status, men with a history of public care were less likely to attain high social class (OR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4-0.9) and more likely to have been homeless (OR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.1-3.8), have a conviction (OR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.5-3.4), have psychological morbidity (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.1-3.0), and be in poor general health (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1-2.6). Similar associations were found in women. Men but not women with a history of care were more likely to be unemployed (OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.4 -5.0) and less likely to attain a higher degree (OR: 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2- 0.7). Non-white ethnicity was associated with poorer adult outcomes of being in care. Conclusions. Public care in childhood is associated with adverse adult socioeconomic, educational, legal, and health outcomes in excess of that associated with childhood or adult disadvantage.

N2  - Objective: The main goal of this study was to construct a prognostic model for HIV seroconversion among injection drug users (IDUs) using easy-to-measure risk indicators. Design(s): Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used for risk stratification in a heterogeneous population of IDUs with regards to HIV risk-taking behaviors. Method(s): Subjects were recruited in a prospective cohort of IDUs followed between September 1992 and October 2001. A total of 1602 men, seronegative at enrollment with at least 1 follow-up visit, were included in the analyses. Only variables that consistently predict HIV seroconversion in several settings were considered. The final model was used to assign a risk score for each participant. Result(s): Three risk indicators were included in the risk score to predict HIV seroconversion: unstable housing, average cocaine injections per day, and having shared a syringe with a known HIV-positive partner. Kaplan-Meier survival functions were generated and risk score values stratified in 3 groups. HIV incidence rates per 100 person-years were as follows: 0.91 (95% CI, 0.55-1.52) for the low-risk group, 3.10 (95% CI, 2.49-3.84) for the moderate-risk group, and 7.82 (95% CI, 6.30-9.73) for the high-risk group (log-rank P value < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): If validated in other settings, this risk score may improve the prediction of outcome and allow more accurate stratification in clinical trials.

T1  - Stabilization of the retinal vascular network by reciprocal feedback between blood vessels and astrocytes
A1  - West H.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Development of the retinal vasculature is controlled by a hierarchy of interactions among retinal neurons, astrocytes and blood vessels. Retinal neurons release platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFA) to stimulate proliferation of astrocytes, which in turn stimulate blood vessel growth by secreting vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF). Presumably, there must be counteractive mechanisms for limiting astrocyte proliferation and VEGF production to prevent runaway angiogenesis. Here, we present evidence that the developing vessels provide feedback signals that trigger astrocyte differentiation - marked by cessation of cell division, upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and downregulation of VEGF. We prevented retinal vessel development by raising newborn mice in a high-oxygen atmosphere, which leads, paradoxically, to retinal hypoxia (confirmed by using the oxygen-sensing reagent EF5). The forced absence of vessels caused prolonged astrocyte proliferation and inhibited astrocyte differentiation in vivo. We could reproduce these effects by culturing retinal astrocytes in a low oxygen atmosphere, raising the possibility that blood-borne oxygen itself might induce astrocyte differentiation and indirectly prevent further elaboration of the vascular network.

T1  - Factors associated with homelessness of adolescents under supervision of the youth protection system
A1  - Robert M.

A1  - Fournier L. 
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - There are two factors that limit our knowledge of the risk factors associated with homelessness among runaway adolescents, namely (1) the samples used are often composed of youth homeless service users and/or youths living on the streets (visible homelessness), whereas most adolescents in fact use "private" resources (hidden homelessness), and (2) failure to use an adequate control group to identify risk factors associated specifically with homelessness. Our study compares the characteristics of two groups of youths under the supervision of the youth protection system, according to the presence or absence of periods of homelessness. The results throw light on the factors underlying the shift from "at risk" to "homeless", showing that youths with experience of homelessness are more likely to have been placed in substitute home environments, have experienced significant relationship difficulties with one of their parents (deterioration of the parent/youth relationship and parental abuse) and to have been diagnosed with behavioural disorders. The findings suggest that the decision to place young people under supervision is based more on the dynamic between risk factors rather than on the existence of behavioural problems. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Ecologically based family therapy outcome with substance abusing runaway adolescents
A1  - Slesnick N.
A1  - Prestopnik J.L. 
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Runaway youth report a broader range and higher severity of substance-related, mental health and family problems relative to non-runaway youth. Most studies to date have collected self-report data on the family and social history; virtually no research has examined treatment effectiveness with this population. This study is a treatment development project in which 124 runaway youth were randomly assigned to (1) ecologically based family therapy (EBFT) or (2) service as usual (SAU) through a shelter. Youth completed an intake, posttreatment, 6 and 12 months follow-up assessment. Youth assigned to EBFT reported greater reductions in overall substance abuse compared to youth assigned to SAU while other problem areas improved in both conditions. Findings suggest that EBFT is an efficacious intervention for this relatively severe population of youth. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the interaction of temperament and environment and how these impact on the psychological function of street children and non-street children in Eldoret Kenya. METHOD(S): This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Eldoret town. A Revised Dimensions of Temperament Survey (DOTS-R) a 54 item, factor-analytically-developed self-report instrument that measures nine temperament dimensions was used. RESULT(S): The statistical analysis showed that the largest significant level was on the approach/withdrawal dimension (F = 12.38, p<.001) the activity level-sleep (F = 4.20, p<.01) and the task orientation (F = 3.62, p<.01) dimensions were next in rank in terms of significance. The highest mean score on activity level-general (17.88) and the activity level-sleep (9.65) were in the "of" the street children that is consistent with their scavenging lifestyle and sleeping patterns. They have to be vigilant when sleeping on shop verandas, run down buildings, and trash-bins. CONCLUSION(S): These results support earlier research on street children. Counter to public opinion and hostility, the children are resilient, adaptable and flexibile in the face of adversity and remaining well adjusted as individuals.

N2  - Objective: To examine participation in the Food Stamp Program, food pantries, and soup kitchens and to identify reasons food-insecure households choose not to participate. Design(s): Cross-sectional retrospective cohort study. Setting(s): In respondents' homes. Participant(s): 330 randomly selected low-income households (below 185% of poverty). Main Outcome Measure(s): Participation in any of 3 public or private food assistance programs and barriers to participation in each program. Analysis: Chi-square tests of association between program participation and sociodemographic characteristics. Logistic regression tested for associations between program participation and ethnicity and between food security status and household composition while controlling for potential confounding factors. Result(s): Controlling for socioeconomic status, Black households are less than half as likely to receive food stamps (odds ratio [OR] = 0.49; P < .02) as Hispanic households. Hispanic households are more likely than non-Hispanic households to say that they feel uncomfortable using food pantries (P < .01). Elderly households are less than half as likely to receive food stamps (OR = 0.44; P = .04) as nonelderly households and are more likely to say that they feel uncomfortable receiving food stamps (P = .05). Conclusions and Implications: Low-income households' perceptions of which programs are socially acceptable differ by race and age. Outreach for food stamps and private food assistance should accommodate these differences so that food-insecure households can benefit from all available food assistance.

N2  - The objective of the present study was to determine whether provision of health advocacy for homeless patients would reduce the burden of care for a primary healthcare team. The impact of a health advocacy intervention was assessed in a quasi-experimental, three-armed controlled trial. Homeless patients registering at an inner-city health centre were allocated in alternating periods to health advocacy (with or without outreach registration) or 'usual care' over a total intake period of 3 years. The client group were homeless people in hostels or other temporary accommodation in the Liverpool 8 area of the UK. The majority of participants (n = 400) were women (76%) in their twenties (mean age = 26.6 years). Most (63%) were temporarily housed at either one of the women's refuges or Liverpool City Council family hostels, and all were registered with an inner-city health centre. Data on health service utilisation over a 3-month period was collected for all clients recruited to the study and direct health service costs were measured. Homeless adults who were proactively registered by the health advocate on outreach visits to hostels made significantly less use of health centre resources whilst having more contact with the health advocate than patients who registered at the health centre at a time of need. There was no reduction in health centre workload when the offer of health advocacy was made after registration at the health centre. The additional costs of providing health advocacy were offset by a reduction in demand for health-centre-based care. The results demonstrate that health advocacy can alter the pattern of help-seeking by temporarily homeless adults. The intervention was cost-neutral. The short-term health service workload associated with symptomatic homeless patients requiring medication was not reduced, but outreach health advocacy was used successfully to address psycho-social issues and reduce the workload for primary care staff.

N2  - Runaway youth are 6-12 times more likely to become infected with HIV than other youth. Using a quasi-experimental design, the efficacy of an HIV prevention program was evaluated over 2 years among 2 groups of runaways: (1) those at 2 shelters who received Street Smart, an intensive HIV intervention program, and (2) youth at 2 control shelters. Street Smart provided youth with access to health care and condoms and delivered a 10-session skill-focused prevention program based on social learning theory to youth. Prior to analysis of the intervention's outcomes, propensity scores were used to identify comparable subgroups of youth in the intervention (n = 101) and control conditions (n = 86). Compared to females in the control condition, females in the intervention condition significantly reduced their unprotected sexual acts at 2 years and alcohol use, marijuana use, and the number of drugs used over 12 months. Male adolescents in the intervention condition showed significant reductions in marijuana use over 6 months compared to control youth. Adolescent HIV prevention programs must proactively identify mechanisms for maintaining behavior change over the long-term, and innovative research designs are needed to allow examination of agency-level interventions.

N2  - Little is known about the similarities and differences between civilian and military child maltreatment cases and no recent study has compared them directly. Understanding the nature of the problems in each could lead to identifying strengths and weaknesses for the development of more helpful prevention and treatment programs. The overall rates of child maltreatment in the U.S. civilian population (14.7 to 11.8 per 1,000) were about double the Army rates (7.6 to 6.0 per 1,000) from 1995 to 1999. These differences were largely because of the higher rate of neglect in the U.S. data--about three times that of the Army--and may be because of factors that are largely controlled in the Army such as poverty, severe substance abuse, homelessness, and other social variables. For 1999 only, we examined the type of maltreatment by age and sex, the victim rates by race/ethnicity, and the relationship of perpetrator to victim.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The objective of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of a health advocate's casework with homeless people in a primary care setting in terms of improvements in health-related quality of life (QoL). The impact of the health advocacy intervention was assessed in a quasi-experimental, three-armed controlled trial. Homeless people moving into hostels or other temporary accommodation in the Liverpool 8 area of the UK and patients registering at an inner-city health centre as temporary residents were allocated in alternating periods to health advocacy (with or without outreach registration) or 'usual care' over a total intake period of 3 years. Health-related QoL outcomes were assessed using three independent self-report measures: the Life Fulfilment Scale; the Delighted-Terrible Faces Scale; and the Nottingham Health Profile. Out of the 326 homeless people who were given baseline questionnaires at registration, 222 (68%) returned usable questionnaires. Out of these individuals, 171 (77.0%) were traceable at follow-up, and 117 (68.4%) follow-up questionnaires were returned. The majority of respondents (n = 117) were women (72%) who were under 30 years of age (74%), white British (91%), and single (63%) or separated (23%), many of whom were living with their children (41 %) in either women's refuges (30%) or family hostels (25%). Improvements in health-related QoL were greatest in people recruited and supported by a health advocate early in their stay in temporary housing, in comparison with those in the control group given 'usual care' at the health centre. The model of streamlined care for patients with complex psycho-social needs is shown to be a worthwhile and effective option for primary healthcare providers.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - This study examined factors associated with the use of the Health Care for the Homeless Program and other health care services by homeless adults. A total of 941 homeless adults were identified in 52 soup kitchens in U.S. communities. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were applied. Among homeless adults, having dental problems was the most robust factor associated with their use of Health Care for the Homeless Program services (odds ratio [OR] = 2.50, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.44-4.32). Among homeless adults who did not visit Health Care for the Homeless Program services during last six months, the number of emergency room visits was the most powerful factor associated with their use of other health care services (OR = 1.15, 95 percent CI = 1.05-1.26). The results of the study can help health care providers better serve homeless adults to meet their health needs.

N2  - This cross-sectional study examines whether lack of awareness of symptoms is a predictor for nonadherence. The study consecutively recruited 134 participants with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, diagnoses of schizophrenia spectrum disorders at acute psychiatric units. Outcome was measured by a combination of self-reports, utilizing the Rating on Medication Influences and medical records. The univariate analysis showed that homelessness was a predictor for nonadherence (p = .03). The subsequent logistic regression showed that the multidimension symptom lack of awareness score was significantly associated with nonadherence to psychotropic medications (odds ratio = 0.59, 95% Confidence Interval = 0.35, 0.96). Other clinical and demographic variables as well as subjective responses were not significant predictors of nonadherence.

A1  - Puent B.D.
A1  - Nichols K.K. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Periodic dilated eye examinations are recommended by the American Optometric Association, American Academy of Ophthalmology, and American Diabetes Association to detect sight-threatening conditions in diabetic patients. However, many patients with diabetes do not receive this recommended eye care and there is limited research to explain why. The objective of this study was to determine reasons some diabetic patients do not receive a dilated eye examination at least every year. METHOD(S): A chart review identified patients at The Ohio State University College of Optometry who had not been examined for more than a year, but less than two years. A telephone interview was attempted for all subjects. RESULT(S): Of 100 eligible subjects, 43 completed the telephone interview. The reasons patients with diabetes did not return for a recommended dilated eye examination included transfer of care to another eye doctor, limited personal mobility due to poor overall health, last examination at a homeless clinic, self-reported lack of insurance, and self-reported apathy. CONCLUSION(S): Strategies to improve compliance of patients with diabetes should include reaching patients of low socioeconomic status and those institutionalized for poor overall health. Improved compliance may also come by encouraging patients to use medical insurance for eye examinations and using patient recall systems.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - The comparative salience of attitudes, normative influences, and perceptions of the ease or difficulty of engaging in marijuana use was examined in 91 adolescents from three subsamples: those living in Nimbin, Australia, where marijuana use appears to have become normalized, a control group, and a group of homeless adolescents, surveyed in 1997. There were no differences between two of the groups in relation to their attitudes towards marijuana, and no differences in perceived access to the drug. For those who intended using marijuana, personal beliefs were significantly more salient than beliefs about what important others thought they should do.

T1  - Factors in the psychological adjustment of homeless adolescent males: The role of coping style
A1  - Votta E.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Objective: This cross-sectional study explored differences in and the association of self-reported coping style, negative life events, self-esteem, and perceived social support with the psychological adjustment (i.e., depressive symptoms, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems) of homeless and nonhomeless adolescent males. Method(s): Data were collected from 100 youths accessing an emergency shelter and two comparison groups of nonhomeless youths: 70 youths accessing local community drop-in centers and 54 high school youths who had never accessed a shelter or drop-in. Data were collected from January 2000 to January 2001 in Ottawa. Result(s): Homeless youths reported a higher prevalence of family dysfunction, school difficulties, suicide attempts, legal problems, and substance use than nonhomeless youths. Homeless youths differed from nonhomeless youths for each outcome measure, reporting a greater use of the disengagement coping style, higher negative life events index, less perceived parental support, and higher levels of depressive symptoms and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that disengagement coping and self-worth accounted for significant amounts of variance in depressive symptomatology, and both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in homeless youths. Conclusion(s): Findings reflect the merit of considering coping style as a factor in the prevalence of psychological maladjustment among homeless youths.

T1  - The impact of homelessness on the health of families
A1  - Morris R.I.
A1  - Strong L. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Qualitative research using the symbolic interactionism framework and grounded theory methodology was employed to discover the perceived health problems and dangers that homeless families with children endure. Data were collected using semistructured interviews from 34 homeless volunteer participants with 87 children. An in-depth analysis of the data using the constant comparative method led to recurrent descriptors and patterns, which were synthesized under four themes: external locus of control, deterrents to health, economic barriers, and lack of support. The findings indicate that there is an urgent need for preventive approaches to alleviate homelessness and its attendant health problems. Recommendations consistent with current federal, state, and local strategies and plans for the early identification and prevention of homelessness are presented. School nurses have an important role as advocates, health educators, and coordinators to promote realistic strategies, programs, and policies in the delivery of services to homeless families.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - This study examined victim and assault characteristics and the nature and extent of coercion, violence, and physical injuries among adult male victims of sexual assaults. Client records of three groups presenting to a sexual assault care center were included: males assaulted by a stranger (n = 64), males assaulted by an acquaintance (n = 81), and females assaulted by an acquaintance (n = 106). Study results revealed that male victims of sexual assault tended to be young, single men who reported high rates of vulnerabilities such as homelessness and physical, psychiatric, and cognitive disabilities. Male stranger assailant victims were more likely to experience assaults involving weapons and physical violence. Injuries sustained by victims and services delivered at the sexual assault care center were similar for both male and female clients. The results of this study reveal new information about violence in male sexual assaults and the vulnerability of the male victims.

T1  - Mothering in public: a meta-synthesis of homeless women with children living in shelters
A1  - Meadows-Oliver M. 
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - ISSUES AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to synthesize the current qualitative literature on homeless women with children living in shelters. METHOD(S): Eighteen qualitative studies on homeless women with children living in shelters were included in the synthesis. The meta-synthesis was conducted using the meta-ethnographic approach of Noblit and Hare (1988). RESULT(S): Six reciprocal translations (themes) of homeless mothers caring for their children in shelters emerged: On becoming homeless, protective mothering, loss, stressed and depressed, survival strategies, and strategies for resolution. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The results may be used by healthcare workers as a framework for developing intervention strategies directed toward helping mothers find new solutions to dealing with shelter living and innovative ways to resolve their homelessness.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - In response to the Surgeon General's request for more research on racial disparities in mental health care, especially research that includes high-need populations (e.g., the homeless, incarcerated, children in foster care, and substance abusers), we examined racial disparities in the provision of mental health counseling, psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy in hospital outpatient settings using nationally representative data from the 1997 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). After controlling for diagnosis and other factors, we found that African Americans were less likely than whites to receive mental health counseling and psychotherapy, but more likely than whites to receive pharmacotherapy. We also found that substance abuse clinics were more likely than primary care and specialty mental health clinics to provide mental health counseling and psychotherapy. However, specialty mental health clinics were the only clinics to provide pharmacotherapy. Future research should examine racial disparities in a variety of settings, controlling for diagnosis as well as other factors.

T1  - Providing better opportunities for older children in the child welfare system
A1  - Massinga R.
A1  - Pecora P.J. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - A growing number of children over age 10 reside in and emancipate from foster care every year. Older children face many of the same challenges as younger children, but they also have unique developmental needs. This article discusses older children in the child welfare system and finds: Approximately 47% of children in foster care are over age 11, and in 2001, 20% of children leaving foster care were over age 16. Older children need permanency, stability, and a "forever family." Maintaining connections with siblings and other kin can be a crucial resource for older children as they transition to independence. Former foster children are at higher risk for a number of negative outcomes, such as substance abuse, homelessness, and low educational attainment, but the research on older youth is limited and often does not consider the strengths these youth exhibit. Much can be done to better serve older children while they are in care and to provide them with better opportunities as they transition out of the system. Programs that draw on community resources, promote a system of care, link children to mentors, and teach them life skills hold promise for improving the lives of these children.

Method(s): Twenty or more children aged 18 to 48 months and their primary caregivers were recruited from three sites: a treatment team for maltreated young children (n = 20), a homeless shelter (n= 25), and Head Start centers (n= 24). All dyads completed a semistructured clinical assessment and laboratory and home-based attachment measures. Result(s): All but one type of attachment disorder could be identified reliably by clinician raters (kappa range = 0.62-0.74, depending on subtype). Children from the maltreatment sample were significantly more likely to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups (p < .001). As predicted, children without an attachment disorder were more likely to be classified as securely attached than those with an attachment disorder (p = .03); however, children classified as having disorganized attachment were not more likely to receive an attachment disorder diagnosis. Conclusion(s): Attachment disorders can be reliably diagnosed in young children, though research on refining disorder criteria should precede intervention trials.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - A qualitative study was undertaken with four groups - immigrants, youths, Aboriginal people, and landlords - in order to explore, compare, and contrast diversity issues among the homeless population and those at risk of homelessness in a larger Canadian city (Calgary, Alberta) with a smaller city (Lethbridge, Alberta), to better understand their needs and to make recommendations for improvement in service delivery and policy formation. This paper focuses on the findings from our sample of youths who shared information on a range of factors that contributed to their being homeless or at risk of being homeless. The youths in this study also shared their positive as well as negative experiences with educators, peers, family members, and social service providers. Canada's homeless include growing numbers of young people, families, women, and members of various ethnic communities, including Aboriginal people and immigrants. Today it is no longer possible to articulate a single silhouette of the homeless, but rather a diversity of profiles is needed. It was in the light of this reality that a study, "Diversity Among the Homeless and Those At Risk," was carried out. It was undertaken with four groups - immigrants, youths, Aboriginal people, and landlords.

N2  - High-level penicillin resistance has been associated with treatment failure in patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. To identify a subgroup of patients at low risk for high-level penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae bacteremia, a cross-sectional study of 303 patients was performed. For the total study population, penicillin resistance was observed in 98 (32%) of 303 patients; high-level resistance was seen in 33 (11%). A predictive model was created by using 3 baseline variables that were independently associated with high-level penicillin resistance: previous beta-lactam antibiotic use, previous stay in a risk area (defined as stay in day care facilities, prisons, homeless shelters, nursing homes, or other long-term care facilities), and previous respiratory tract infection. The model was used to identify patients at low and high risk for high-level penicillin-resistant pneumococcal bacteremia. None of the isolates of patients in the low-risk subgroup had ceftriaxone resistance. Patients in the low-risk subgroup could be empirically treated with fluoroquinolone-sparing regimens.

T1  - Assessment of alcohol and other drug use by runaway youths: A test-retest study of the Form 90
A1  - Slesnick N.
A1  - Tonigan J.S. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - While excellent adolescent alcohol and drug screening tools are available, there are relatively few, if any, psychometrically validated measures to use in the assessment of adolescent treatment outcome. This study conducted a test-retest exercise of the Form 90 Drug and Alcohol (Form 90 DnA) to determine the stability of adolescent responses when administering the day-by-day calendar/grid approach. Homeless youth (N = 37) with alcohol, drug, or alcohol and drug abuse/dependence combined were recruited to participate in the test-retest study. High pre-post stability in means was obtained on measures of frequency of substance use in general, and on specific measures of alcohol, cocaine, marijuana use. The findings from this paper provide support for the reliability and validity of the Form 90 for use with adolescent runaways with a substance abuse or dependence diagnosis. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To determine treatment completion among patients with tuberculosis (TB), and to analyse factors associated with treatment default and fatality. METHOD(S): A prospective cohort study of patients who began treatment between 1 June 1999 and 31 May 2000 in areas where members of the SEPAR Tuberculosis and Respiratory Infections Group work. Factors associated with treatment default and fatality were studied using logistic regression, calculating odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULT(S): The study involved 142 physicians from 76 different hospitals who provided information on 1515 cases. Eighty-two per cent of the patients completed treatment correctly, 14% defaulted, 5% died, 0.5% failed, and 8.7% interrupted treatment due to transfer or other reasons. The variables associated with default were intravenous drug use (IVDU) (OR 6.00, 95%CI 2.59-13.89) and immigration (OR 8.57, 95%CI 3.78-19.45); sex, age, homelessness, incarceration, directly observed treatment (DOT) or hospitalisation were not associated with default. Variables found to be predictive of fatality were alcoholism (OR 6.38, 95%CI 2.09-19.48), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (OR 7.08, 95%CI 2.08-29.15) and age >64 years (OR 10, 95%CI 2.9-34.07), whereas sex, IVDU, homelessness, DOT and hospitalisation were not. CONCLUSION(S): In industrialised countries, IVDU patients and immigrants should be targeted for DOT, while to reduce fatality rates stricter monitoring is required for patients who are alcoholic, HIV-infected, or aged >64 years.

T1  - The social distribution of reports of health-related concerns among adolescents in Sao Paulo, Brazil
A1  - De Moura S.L. 
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - This study investigated the health-related concerns of adolescents living on streets as compared to poor and privileged adolescents living with their families in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The different groups of respondents were similar in terms of individuals' fear of disease and lack of concern about health in old age. AIDS and cancer were feared by most of the respondents in the different groups, particularly because of their severity and people's vulnerability to these conditions. Health in old age was not a major concern in any of the study groups. It is suggested that health educators take into account the wide range of concerns among adolescents on the streets in order to design interventions that cater for different levels of interest and motivation. It is also argued that there is a need for health education in order to clarify misperceptions about disease transmission, prevention and treatment among adolescents from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

N2  - Objective: To examine family risk factors associated with dissociative symptoms among homeless and runaway youth. Method(s): Three hundred and twenty-eight homeless and runaway youth were interviewed using a systematic sampling strategy in metropolitan Seattle. Homeless young people were interviewed on the streets and in shelters by outreach workers in youth service agencies. Result(s): The current study revealed widespread prevalence of dissociative symptoms among these young people. Multivariate analyses revealed that sexual abuse, physical abuse, and family mental health problems were all positively associated with dissociative symptoms. No gender differences were found for any of the models. Conclusion(s): Dissociative behavior is widespread among these youth and may pose a serious mental health concern. Some young people experience numerous stressors, and with few resources and little support available, many may invoke maladaptive strategies such as dissociative behavior to handle such situations, which may in turn be detrimental to their mental health. Unless youth are provided with programs and intervention, the cycle of abuse that they have experienced at home is likely to continue on the street. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Hypothesis: A high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in soft tissue infections presents a treatment challenge. Design(s): Retrospective analysis. Setting(s): The San Francisco General Hospital Integrated Soft Tissue Infection (ISIS) Clinic. Patient(s): Patients treated at the ISIS Clinic from July 1, 2000, to June 30, 2003. Main Outcome Measure(s): Information on patient demographics, surgical procedures, microbiologic studies, and antibiotic treatments was obtained for all patients treated in the ISIS Clinic. Microbial data and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of S aureus, treatment outcome, and antibiotic prescribed were analyzed for all evaluable patients. Result(s): The ISIS Clinic treated 6156 unique patients for 12012 episodes of infection. In this cohort, 5164 (84%) were either homeless or had no health insurance. More than half of the patients (58%) were injection drug users, but most had only 1 prior visit to the clinic (62%). Patients underwent a surgical procedure 7707 times (64%). Of the 837 positive cultures obtained, S aureus was recovered 695 times (83%), and 525 (63%) of the cultures contained MRSA. Therefore, a full 76% of all S aureus isolated was MRSA. In a subset analysis of 622 cultures collected prospectively from consecutive patients, 282 (45%) grew organisms, of which 256 (91%) were S aureus. MRSA represented 59% of all S aureus isolated. Homelessness and injection drug use were risk factors for infection by S aureus and MRSA. In another subgroup of patients with soft tissue infections that required admission to the hospital, MRSA was recovered from the cultures in 149 patients. In these patients with MRSA, 44 (30%) only received a beta-lactam antibiotic, inactive against MRSA, and had full resolution of their infection. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of MRSA soft tissue infections in the medically underserved ISIS Clinic cohort is extremely high. The transmission of the MRSA seems to be in the community. Antibiotic therapy directed at MRSA may not be needed in a large number of patients with these soft tissue infections. Studies to identify the source and cause of this MRSA outbreak are urgently needed. Clinical trials to examine the need for antibiotic therapy in soft tissue infections should be conducted.

T1  - Suicide, high-risk behaviors, and coping style in homeless adolescent males' adjustment
A1  - Votta E.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the association among suicide behaviors, high-risk behaviors, coping style, and psychological adjustment (i.e., depressive symptomatology, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems) in homeless and non-homeless adolescent males (aged 16 to 19 years). Method(s): Data were obtained from 100 homeless youth accessing an emergency shelter (Ottawa, ON). The comparison group was comprised of 70 youth accessing local community drop-in centers that lived with their parent(s)/guardian(s) and had never stayed in a shelter. Data were analyzed using Chi-square, Student's t-tests, and regression statistics. Result(s): Relative to non-homeless youth, homeless youth were more likely to report drug, alcohol, and tobacco use, legal problems, academic difficulties, and mental health problems. Homeless youth presented with a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation, past suicide attempts, depressive symptomatology, and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Disengagement coping was a predictor of suicidal ideation, past attempts, depressive symptoms and both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in homeless youth. Conclusion(s): Relative to non-homeless youth, findings indicate that homeless youth reported greater use of a disengaging coping style and are at greater risk for high-risk behaviors, past suicide attempts, and clinically elevated levels of depressive symptoms and behavior problems. © Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2004.

T1  - The relationship between child sexual abuse and female delinquency and crime: A prospective study
A1  - Siegel J.A.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Child sexual abuse has been hypothesized to be an especially significant factor in the etiology of girls' delinquency and women's crime. This article reports on a prospective study of 206 women who, in the period from 1973 to 1975, were treated in a hospital emergency room in a major city following a report of sexual abuse. Their subsequent juvenile and adult criminal records were compared to a matched comparison group. Child sexual abuse was a statistically significant predictor of certain types of offenses, but other indicators of familial neglect and abuse were significant factors as well.

N2  - This study utilized data from the national ACCESS program (N = 7224) to investigate the prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in a sample of homeless people with mental illness. The prevalence of suicidal ideation in this sample was high (66.2% lifetime prevalence). In addition, 51.3% of the sample reported that they had ever attempted suicide, 26.9% reported an attempt that resulted in a nonpsychiatric hospitalization, and 8% reported an attempt in the previous 30 days. Youth, substance abuse, and psychiatric symptoms were all significantly associated with suicide attempts. Those who reported a recent attempt also reported higher rates of mental health care utilization, particularly inpatient care. The authors conclude that homeless people with mental illness are at particularly high risk for suicidal behavior, however, only in part because of the high prevalence of traditional risk factors.

N2  - Objective: To assess the relationship between cumulative environmental risks and early intervention, parenting attitudes, potential for child abuse and child development in substance abusing mothers. Method(s): We studied 161 substance-abusing women, from a randomized longitudinal study of a home based early intervention, who had custody of their children through 18 months. The intervention group received weekly home visits in the first 6 months and biweekly visits from 6 to 18 months. Parenting stress and child abuse potential were assessed at 6 and 18 months postpartum. Children's mental and motor development (Bayley MDI and PDI) and language development (REEL) were assessed at 6, 12, and 18 months postpartum. Ten maternal risk factors were assessed: maternal depression, domestic violence, nondomestic violence, family size, incarceration, no significant other in home, negative life events, psychiatric problems, homelessness, and severity of drug use. Level of risk was recoded into four categories (2 or less, 3, 4, and 5 or more), which had adequate cell sizes for repeated measures analysis. Data analysis: Repeated measures analyses were run to examine how level of risk and group (intervention or control) were related to parenting stress, child abuse potential, and children's mental, motor and language development over time. Result(s): Parenting stress and child abuse potential were higher for women with five risks or more compared with women who had four or fewer risks; children's mental, motor, and language development were not related to level of risk. Children in the intervention group had significantly higher scores on the PDI at 6 and 18 months (107.4 vs. 103.6 and 101.1 vs. 97.2) and had marginally better scores on the MDI at 6 and 12 months (107.7 vs. 104.2 and 103.6 vs. 100.1), compared to the control group. Conclusion(s): Compared to drug-abusing women with fewer than five risks, women with five or more risks found parenting more stressful and indicated greater inclination towards abusive and neglectful behavior, placing their infants at increased risk for poor parenting, abuse and neglect. Early home-based intervention in high-risk families may be beneficial to infant development. French- and Spanish-language abstracts not available at time of publication. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - This study investigated an HIV prevention program for homeless young adult injection drug users (IDUs) that combined a secondary syringe exchange program (SEP) with community-level activities. Homeless young IDUs were recruited from street-based settings in San Francisco, and a structured questionnaire was administered. The secondary SEP operated in a circumscribed geographic area, and for analytic purposes respondents were assigned to the intervention site group if they primarily spent time in this area (n = 67), or the comparison site group if they primarily spent time elsewhere (n = 55). Almost all (96%) intervention site youth had used the secondary SEP in the past 30 days and were significantly more likely to regularly use SEP. In bivariate analysis, comparison site IDUs were more likely to share syringes, reuse syringes, share the cotton used to filter drugs, and use condoms with casual sex partners only inconsistently. In multivariate analysis, comparison site remained positively associated with sharing syringes (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.748; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.406-9.988), reusing syringes (AOR, 2.769; 95% CI,1.120-6.847), and inconsistent condom use with casual sex partners (AOR, 4.825; 95% CI, 1.392- 16.721). This suggests that the intervention was effective in delivering SEP services to homeless young adult IDUs, and that IDUs who frequented the intervention site had a lower HIV risk than comparison group IDUs.

N2  - In contrast to other countries as USA, Australia and some European countries there are no German studies concerning psychiatric disorders in runaway and homeless children and adolescents. Although the presence of street youths faces a big problem, there is a deficit of empirical data among this group for the planning of more efficient differential programming. In this pilot study we investigated male and female street adolescents among ICD-10 respectively DSM-IV criteria. The goal of this study was to build gender-specific hypotheses and to investigate the applicability and practicability of the standardised diagnostic instruments assessing psychiatric and substance-related disorders.

N2  - Investigators examined the 6-month impact of three cognitive-behavioral HIV risk-reduction programs on behavioral factors (substance use and sexual risk behaviors) and cognitive and psychological resources of 325 women who resided in emergency or sober-living shelters and their 308 intimate sexual partners. Participants were randomized by shelter to a peer-mentored, a nurse case-managed, or a standard care HIV risk-reduction program. Significant improvements were observed in all groups in all behavioral factors and cognitive and psychological resources except for self-esteem. Participants in the peer-mentored and nurse case-managed groups did not differ significantly from the standard group in self-esteem, life satisfaction, psychological well-being, use of noninjection drugs, sex with multiple partners, and unprotected sex at 6 months (n = 633). It was concluded that a standard approach by health care professionals appears to effectively modify HIV risk behaviors for a majority of homeless participants and may have important economic and policy implications. Further, the impact of short-term programs that address psychological vulnerabilities of impoverished populations needs to be studied further. Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine the psychosocial, behavioral, and environmental profiles of homeless women, both those with and without a history of victimization, and their intimate partners. Five hundred seven homeless women and their intimate partners participated in the study. Thirty-nine percent of the women reported being physically and/or sexually assaulted as adults. Controlling for potential confounders, victimized women were more likely than others to have a history of childhood sexual and physical abuse, lifetime substance use, greater mental health symptomatology, and current risky sexual activity. Thus, homeless women with mental health and substance abuse problems ought to be screened for violent experiences and encouraged to obtain treatment appropriate to their problems to reduce their ongoing risk of victimization.

N2  - The question has been raised whether the change from hospital to community psychiatry is accompanied by an increasing number of the mentally ill in institutions for homeless people. During week 49, 1996, the residents in institutions for homeless people in the County of Funen were interviewed and diagnosed according to ICD-8, and the results were compared with a similar study from week 47, 1990. The prevalence of psychoses was 11% in 1990 and 14% in 1996. This difference was not significant. Significantly fewer psychotic homeless people were treated for their psychotic disorders in 1996 compared with 1990. The prevalence of alcoholics had fallen by 35%, while the prevalence of narcotics and cannabis addicts had risen by 78% and 110%, respectively. These changes were statistically significant. There was still a high prevalence of personality disorders, 70% in 1990 and 60% in 1996. Even though the deinstitutionalization of the psychiatric service has not been accompanied by more psychotic patients in institutions for the homeless, the clientele is still heavily strained with psychosis, personality disorder and substance abuse.

N2  - Substance abuse by women is considered an individual pathology, and the larger social processes of recovery are seldom explored. This research study examined social factors that influenced completion of an outpatient women-centered substance abuse treatment program. The treatment records of a group of 15 women who completed the program were compared with a group who did not complete the program. More completers had previous life successes in the areas of education, job skills, and employment history. Completers also had fewer children, less involvement with child protective services, and lower levels of chaos, a construct that included the presence of two of any of the following in women's lives: child protective services, homelessness, psychiatric diagnosis, or domestic violence. Completion of substance abuse treatment seems more likely for women with personal and social resources. If programs are to be successful, adequate funding must be provided for both assessment and support of the social problems encountered by the most vulnerable women.

T1  - Abuse, support, and depression among homeless and runaway adolescents

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - This study examines the effectiveness of social support networks on psychological well-being among 602 homeless and runaway adolescents. The respondents were interviewed in shelters, drop-in centers, and on the streets in cities of four Midwestern states (Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas). The path model was used to test the direct effect of family abuse and precocious independence on adolescent depressive symptoms and indirect effects through social support networks. Results indicate that although abusive family origins contribute directly to depressive symptoms there are indirect effects of family abuse and early independence through social support networks. Family abuse and early independence drive homeless adolescents to rely on peers for social support. While support from friends on the street reduces depression, association with deviant peers increases depression.

T1  - Antecedents of physical and sexual victimization among homeless women: a comparison to homeless men
A1  - Wenzel S.L.
A1  - Koegel P.
A1  - Gelberg L. 
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - Homeless women experience extensive health risks including physical and sexual victimization. Few studies that have gathered information on homeless persons have reported results separately for women or have compared them directly with men. Research that both investigates antecedents of victimization among homeless women and compares them to those for men is necessary to determine whether prevention efforts must be different for each group. We investigated potential antecedents of recent (past 30 days) physical and sexual victimization in a probability sample of 394 homeless women and compared findings to those for 1159 homeless men. As hypothesized, mental disorder, substance dependence, and engaging in economic survival strategies significantly predicted victimization among homeless women. With few dissimilarities, these characteristics also predicted victimization among homeless men. Although differences in the needs and experiences of homeless women and men must be recognized, both women and men require assistance to establish and maintain safe residences, treatment of any substance use and mental disorder, and alternatives to economic survival strategies that place them at risk for victimization.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Responding to the medical needs of the homeless population across the United States exact large costs on the health care system. To provide effectively for such vulnerable populations, health care systems require creative and efficient strategies of service organization tailored to the specific needs of the homeless. However, such needs often vary by geographic region due to the inherent diversity of the population. Currently, no published medical evaluation of the urban homeless in Texas exists. Therefore, this study examines 93,074 diagnoses given to 20,331 homeless patients seen in a seven-year period in a primary care mobile and fixed clinic system. The most frequent disease conditions evaluated in this cohort of patients are reported. These findings may be useful to clinical site managers and health care planners contemplating an outreach program for the homeless.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare health problems and medical coverage of homeless and housed children who used a school-based health center (SBHC) for comprehensive care. METHOD(S): Medical charts of homeless children (n = 76) and housed children (n = 232) seen for comprehensive care at an SBHC in New York City during the 1998-99 school year were systematically reviewed and compared. RESULT(S): Controlled for ethnicity and medical coverage, homeless children were 2.5 times as likely (P <.001) to have health problems and 3 times as likely (P <.001) to have severe health problems as housed children. The most common health problems identified in the homeless population were asthma (33%), vision (13%), mental health (9%), and acute problems (8%). Lack of medical coverage was evident in 58% of homeless children, compared with 15% of housed children (P <.001). CONCLUSION(S): Study findings identify homeless children as being at increased risk for health problems and lack of medical coverage. These findings support use of an SBHC for comprehensive care by underserved segments of the population and a need for increased vigilance on the part of health care providers caring for homeless children.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - OBJECTIVES: This article examines the prevalence of food insecurity in Canada, the characteristics of people most likely to live in households lacking sufficient funds for food, and several related health problems. DATA SOURCE: The data are from the cross-sectional household component of the 1998/99 National Population Health Survey and the Food Insecurity Supplement to that survey. ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES: Cross-tabulations were used to estimate the percentage of Canadians experiencing food insecurity and the prevalence of five selected health outcomes among people who were and were not food insecure. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association of several socio-demographic and economic factors with food insecurity and to determine the association of food insecurity with the selected health outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: In 1998/99, 10% of Canadians, or about 3 million people, were living in food-insecure households. Low-income households, households depending on social assistance, lone-parent families headed by women, tenants, children, and Aboriginal people had significantly high odds of experiencing food insecurity. Food insecurity was significantly associated with poor/fair health, multiple chronic conditions, obesity, distress and depression.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - The purpose of this study was to compare the stressors and coping behaviors of homeless, previously homeless, and never homeless poor school-aged children. Content analyses of interview data from 132 children were used. Forty-four (68%) of the homeless children identified at least one stressor related to being homeless. The three groups of children were similar in regard to stressors related to the family, self, peers, health, school, and environment. In regard to the violent behavior category, significantly more of the previously homeless and never homeless children expressed stressors compared to the homeless children. Significantly more previously homeless and never homeless children identified more social support coping behaviors compared to the homeless children. The three groups of children did not differ in regard to the use of behavioral and cognitive coping strategies.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Hunger, with its adverse consequences for children, continues to be an important national problem. Previous studies that document the deleterious effects of hunger among children cannot distinguish child from family hunger and do not take into account some critical environmental, maternal, and child variables that may influence child outcomes. This study examines the independent contribution of child hunger on children's physical and mental health and academic functioning, when controlling for a range of environmental, maternal, and child factors that have also been associated with poor outcomes among children. METHOD(S): With the use of standardized tools, comprehensive demographic, psychosocial, and health data were collected in Worcester, Massachusetts, from homeless and low-income housed mothers and their children (180 preschool-aged children and 228 school-aged children). Mothers and children were part of a larger unmatched case-control study of homelessness among female-headed households. Hunger was measured by a set of 7 dichotomous items, each asking the mother whether she has or her children have experienced a particular aspect of hunger during the past year--1 concerns food insecurity for the entire family, 2 concern adult hunger, and 4 involve child hunger. The items, taken from the Childhood Hunger Identification Project measure, are summed to classify the family and divided into 3 categories: no hunger, adult or moderate child hunger, or severe child hunger (indicating multiple signs of child hunger). Outcome measures included children's chronic health condition count using questions adapted from the National Health Interview Survey, Child Health Supplement, and internalizing behavior problems and anxiety/depression, measured by the Child Behavior Checklist. Additional covariates included demographic variables (ie, age, gender, ethnicity, housing status, number of moves, family size, income), low birth weight, child life events (ie, care and protection order, out of home placement, abuse, severe life events count), developmental problems (ie, developmental delay, learning disability, emotional problems), and mother's distress and psychiatric illness. Multivariate regression analyses examined the effect of child hunger on physical and mental health outcomes. RESULT(S): The average family size for both preschoolers and school-aged children was 3; about one third of both groups were white and 40% Puerto Rican. The average income of families was approximately $11 000. Among the school-aged children, on average 10 years old, 50% experienced moderate child hunger and 16% severe child hunger. Compared with those with no hunger, school-aged children with severe hunger were more likely to be homeless (56% vs 29%), have low birth weights (23% vs 6%), and have more stressful life events (9 vs 6) when compared with those with no hunger. School-aged children with severe hunger scores had parent-reported anxiety scores that were more than double the scores for children with no hunger and significantly higher chronic illness counts (3.4 vs 1.8) and internalizing behavior problems when compared with children with no hunger. There was no relationship between hunger and academic achievement. Among preschool-aged children, who averaged 4 years of age, 51% experienced moderate child hunger and 8% severe child hunger. For preschoolers, compared with children with no hunger, severe hunger was associated with homelessness (75% vs 48%), more traumatic life events (8.5 vs 6), low birth weight (23% vs 6%), and higher levels of chronic illness and internalizing behavior problems. Mothers of both preschoolers and school-aged children who reported severe hunger were more likely to have a lifetime diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder. For school-aged children, severe hunger was a significant predictor of chronic illness after controlling for housing status, mother's distress, low birth weight, and child live events. For preschoolers, moderate hunger was a significant predictor of health conditions while controlling for potenns while controlling for potential explanatory factors. For both preschoolers and school-aged children, severe child hunger was associated with higher levels of internalizing behavior problems. After controlling for housing status, mother's distress, and stressful life events, severe child hunger was also associated with higher reported anxiety/depression among school-aged children. CONCLUSION(S): This study goes beyond previous research and highlights the independent relationship between severe child hunger and adverse physical health and mental health outcomes among low-income children. Study findings underscore the importance of clinical recognition of child hunger and its outcomes, allowing for preventive interventions and efforts to increase access to food-related resources for families.

T1  - Youth homelessness in San Francisco: A life cycle approach
A1  - Auerswald C.L.

Y1  - 2002//
N2  - HIV risk behaviors and seroprevalence are particularly high among street youth. Though many programs have been designed to serve them, street youth have low rates of service utilization. The aim of this street-based, ethnographic project was to study the social and cultural context of street life in this population. Data were collected by participant observation, exploratory interviews and semi-structured interviews. Twenty street youth (15-23 years old; six female), recruited from street sites in San Francisco, participated in the interviews. Field notes and transcriptions were analyzed using an inductive technique for model building. This analysis yielded a proposed model of the life cycle of youth homelessness. In the first on the street stage, youth face an intense psychological feeling of outsiderness, and an urgency to meet basic needs. These stresses either lead to an escape from street life or to a process of acculturation to the street. Initiation to the street is facilitated by street mentors, who provide youth with survival skills. In the stasis stage, youth reach a tenuous equilibrium in which they can meet their basic needs. A strong street ethic allows youth to rationalize significant conflicts and frequent physical suffering. Youth in stasis are repeatedly thrown into disequilibrium, crises that frequently cause them to come into greater contact with mainstream society. After repeated episodes of disequilibrium, some youth extricate themselves from street life, finding a new identity in mainstream society. Otherwise, youth return to the street, in an episode of recidivism. The life cycle model suggests that street youth who are most open to intervention are those who are in transitional states, i.e., those who have just arrived on the street or those who are in crisis (disequilibrium). If this model is validated in a larger population of youth, programs that are aimed at these two stages in the life cycle could potentially effectively complement existing programs, which are usually focused on youth in stasis.

N2  - Purpose: To increase the number of high-risk and homeless youth who receive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test results and posttest counseling. Method(s): Oral HIV testing and counseling were offered to high-risk and homeless youth at sites at which youth congregate throughout Portland, Oregon. Subjects were randomized to receive test results and posttest counseling either in a face-to-face manner or with the option of telephone notification. Self-reported demographic and risk-behavior information was collected prior to HIV testing. The differences in the proportion of youth who received their test results were analyzed according to the notification method and demographic characteristics using SPSS. Result(s): Among the 351 youth who were tested, 48% followed up to receive test results and posttest counseling. Adolescents most likely to receive their results were female, older (19-24 years), and white and those who reported high-risk behaviors. Those given the option of telephone notification were significantly more likely to receive their results than those required to have face-to-face notification (odds ratio = 2.301, 95% confidence interval of 1.499, 3.534). This was true regardless of age, race, history of previous HIV testing, or presence of high-risk behaviors. Two youths tested positive for HIV corroborating previous reports of low HIV prevalence in this population. Both were assigned to the face-to-face notification group and, therefore, no HIV positive results were given by telephone. Conclusion(s): The option of telephone notification significantly increased the proportion of youth who received posttest counseling and results following community-based testing. © Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2002.

A1  - Peat J.K. 
Y1  - 2002//
N2  - Aims: To determine whether family and parenting interventions benefit children and adolescents with conduct disorder and delinquency. Method(s): Meta-analysis of eight randomised controlled trials involving 749 children and adolescents (aged 10-17 years) with conduct disorder and/or delinquency. Criminality, academic performance, future employment, problem behaviour, family functioning, parental mental health, and peer relations were evaluated. Result(s): Family and parenting interventions significantly reduced the time spent by juvenile delinquents in institutions (weighted mean difference 51.34 days). There was also a significant reduction in the risk of a juvenile delinquent being rearrested (relative risk 0.66) and in their rate of subsequent arrests at 1-3 years (standardised mean difference -0.56). Conclusion(s): The evidence suggests that family and parenting interventions for juvenile delinquents and their families have beneficial effects on reducing time spent in institutions and their criminal activity. In addition to the obvious benefit to the participant and their family, this may result in a cost saving for society.

T1  - Exposure of homeless children to family violence: An adverse effect beyond alternative explanations

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - This study explored whether homeless children experience an adverse effect from exposure to family violence after explaining variance due to alternative explanations. Homeless mothers (N = 109) and one child, ages 4 through 17, per mother participated by completing questionnaires and tests. The results showed that exposure to family violence is related to an adverse effect on children, beyond the adverse impact associated with the alternative explanations investigated in this study (i.e., maternal marital status, maternal education, maternal hospitalization for mental health problems, maternal detoxification or hospitalization for substance or alcohol abuse, gender of the child, age of the child, ethnicity of the child, residential moves during the prior two years, aggregate time homeless during the prior two years, a history of physical abuse for the child, intelligence of the child, the extent that the child is physically nurtured, and expectations that the child has for personal control). Additionally, there were three less central, but important results: (1) the rating provided by mothers about the extent to which their children had been exposed to family violence agreed with the independent rating provided by their children; (2) the data suggested that exposure to family violence might better correlate with subsequent behavioral problems when the extent of the exposure is considered; and (3) the results indicated that externalized more than internalized behavioral problems may be an outcome from exposure to family violence. © 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

N2  - Objective: To assess the self-reported health status and its relationship to key demographic variables among patrons of a charity-run meals service at The Exodus Foundation, in urban Sydney, Australia. Method(s): Random-sample cross-sectional study of 100 face-to-face interviews (79% recruitment rate). Self-reported health status was measured by subjective rating scale, open-ended and checklist questions about presence and type of acute and chronic disease. Analysis by logistic regression of fair-poor health status on demographic variables in Exodus patrons and general Sydney population adjusted for age and sex using the 1995 National Health Survey. Result(s): Compared to housed but poor counterparts within the Exodus sample, homeless people were significantly more likely to report fair-poor health status (age-adjusted OR=3.0, 95% CI 1.3-7.1). Exodus patrons, as a whole, were much more likely than Sydney's general population to report fair-poor health status, after adjusting for age and sex (OR=4.5, 95% CI 2.9-7.0) and had a more serious pattern of illness (diseases of the digestive system; depression; common cold; bronchitis; refractive errors; drug and alcohol dependence; diabetes mellitus Type II). Exodus patrons reported fewer acute and chronic illnesses with open-ended questions than with a checklist (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): In this population there was a strong relationship between poor health and homelessness. When patterns of illness and injury were measured within this disadvantage group, they showed more serious illness types than in the general population. Such patterns may not be identified by methods often used in traditional population health surveys.

N2  - Many longitudinal studies in field settings present challenges due to selection bias and incomplete data. A motivating example is provided by an intervention study aimed at preventing HIV transmission among runaway youths housed at shelters in New York City. Two shelters with 167 youths received the intervention, and two shelters with 144 youths received the control treatment. The number of unprotected sexual acts in the prior three months for each youth was assessed at a baseline interview and (to the extent possible) at five follow-up time points. Among observed items, there is strong evidence of a lack of balance on baseline characteristics between the intervention and control groups; meanwhile, beyond occasional missing items among participants interviewed at baseline, there were three items about baseline characteristics added after the study began, resulting in a few items being missing on a large percentage of the study sample. Here, we outline two strategies for handling the complexities of this data set, both of which make use of propensity scores to address the imbalances across treatment groups. One approach relies on available cases and ad hoc choices to simplify the steps leading up to a linear mixed model analysis in SAS PROC MIXED; the other approach uses multiple imputation strategies to reflect uncertainty due to missing values in an analogous linear mixed model analysis. Ultimately we did not find substantial qualitative differences in this setting between the available-case and imputed-data approaches. But in both cases, we find that the considerable imbalance on covariates between treatment arms constrains the ability to draw inferences about the intervention effect, suggesting the importance of evaluating propensity-score distributions in quasi-experimental intervention research.

T1  - Prevalence of psychological distress and psychiatric disorders among homeless youth in Australia: A comparative review
A1  - Kamieniecki G.W. 
Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Objective: To review the prevalence literature on psychological distress and psychiatric disorders among homeless youth in Australia, and to compare these rates with Australian youth as a whole. Method(s): Computerized databases were utilized to access all published Australian studies on psychological distress (as measured by standardized symptom scales and suicidal behaviour) and psychiatric disorders among homeless youth; in addition, unpublished Australian studies were utilized whenever accessible. A total of 14 separate studies were located, only three of which have included non-homeless control groups. In the current review, prevalence data from uncontrolled youth homelessness studies are compared with data from Australian community and student surveys. Result(s): Homeless youth have usually scored significantly higher on standardized measures of psychological distress than all domiciled control groups. Youth homelessness studies have also reported very high rates of suicidal behaviour, but methodological limitations in these studies make comparisons with community surveys difficult. Furthermore, rates of various psychiatric disorders are usually at least twice as high among homeless youth than among youth from community surveys. Conclusion(s): Homeless youth in Australia have extremely high rates of psychological distress and psychiatric disorders. As homeless youth are at risk of developing psychiatric disorders and possibly self-injurious behaviour the longer they are homeless, early intervention in relevant health facilities is required.

N2  - Study objectives: To investigate the characteristics of tuberculosis infection in diabetic patients at Bellevue Hospital. Design(s): We conducted a case-control study retrospectively reviewing the records of patients at Bellevue Hospital Center from 1987 to 1997 with a discharge diagnosis of tuberculosis and diabetes mellitus. Setting(s): Bellevue Hospital Center is a 1,200-bed, inner-city municipal hospital located in the Lower East Side of New York City. Patient(s): Fifty-three identified patients had verified tuberculosis infection and diabetes; of these, 50 charts were available for review. One hundred five control cases were selected from nondiabetic patients with a discharge diagnosis of tuberculosis during the same time period. Measurements and results: Thirty-six percent (18 cases) of the patients with diabetes and tuberculosis had multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) compared to only 10% (10 cases) in the control group (p < 0.01) Controlling for homelessness, HIV status, and directly observed therapy, the relative risk of MDR-TB was calculated to be 8.6 (confidence interval, 3.1 to 23.6) in the diabetic group compared to the control group. Conclusion(s): There was a significant association between diabetes and MDR-TB. Diabetes continues to be a risk factor for tuberculosis and was associated with MDR-TB in our patients.

N2  - The objective of the study was to establish hygiene and health-seeking practices most likely to be predictors of nutritional insecurity among children living in slums. A cross-sectional study was conducted from March to May 1997 comparing 192 households with and 192 without malnourished children. All the households with children in the 3 - 36-month age group were identified. Using underweight (weight-for-age) as an indicator of nutritional insecurity, the households were classified into two groups, namely nutritionally secure and insecure households. Subsequently, sampling frames for each set of households were established and used to select the study households randomly. Four slums in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, constituted the study sites. The results indicated that there was not a significant difference between secure and insecure households with regard to prevalence of immunisation and dietary (food withholding) habits during episodes of diarrhoea. After adjusting (by means of logistical regression) for-covariates, six household behaviours were established as having the power to predict exposure to childhood nutritional insecurity in urban slums of Ethiopia. The presence of children's faeces inside the house, failure to have diarrhoea treated at a health facility, prolonged storage of cooked foods (beyond 24 hours), feeding children with unwashed hands, and poor handling of drinking water and foods are risk factors that can predict nutritional insecurity. Advice with a view to achieving sustainable behaviour change in households, namely good personal and household hygiene practices and increased utilisation of health facilities is recommended as being essential in addressing challenges to nutritional insecurity and in optimising the success of public health programmes.

N2  - In October 1998, hurricane Mitch caused several thousand deaths and left homeless several hundreds of thousands of people in Central America. Many agricultural resources and infrastructures were destroyed. On November 1, France deployed a significant amount of humanitarian aid. For the first time, epidemiologists of the National Network of Public Health accompanied the French rescue squads, Civil Security and world emergency services. The objective of the team of epidemiologists was to rapidly assess the epidemic risks; to give epidemiologic support to the French detachment; to bring a methodological support to the local medical authorities for the investigation of epidemics as well as the installation of monitoring systems adapted to describe the cholera epidemic in Guatemala and to evaluate its management; to determine and prevent the sanitary risks due to the dissemination in the environment of barrels containing phyto-sanitary products in Honduras and to deal with the leptospirosis epidemic in Nicaragua. This experiment showed the utility of inserting the epidemiologic tool in humanitarian aid. However, the implementation of the epidemiologic approach at the exploratory stage would allow better adequacy of the objectives and functions of this plan of action with the medical needs. This is why it is recommended to integrate an epidemiologic dimension in the programming of the humanitarian aid that France is likely to mobilize during such events.

N2  - Objectives: It has been proposed that homeless street girls are more likely to be from dysfunctional families and exhibit psychological distress than homeless street boys, reflecting cultural factors that result in differential norms for male and female behavior. The current analysis examined whether male and female street youth in a mid-sized Brazilian city differed in their family circumstances and day-to-day functioning on the street. Method(s): The opportunity sample consisted of 33 male (mean age 14.3, range 10-17 years) and 33 female (mean age 14.6, range 11-18 years) street youth who participated in a sentence completion task and structured interview examining family experiences and ability to meet daily needs on the street. Result(s): Consistent with the cultural hypothesis, girls described more negative family backgrounds than boys (e.g., they were more likely to have left home because of conflict or abuse, and reported more negative relationships with their parents). However, girls' functioning on the street was similar to, and in some cases more positive than, that of boys (e.g., fewer girls reported police violence and begging to earn money). Conclusion(s): The few gender differences that emerged in this study offer little support for the cultural hypothesis. The findings make sense if local factors, such as services available for male and female youth and public response to street youth, are considered. It appears that street youth differ in their experiences depending on local circumstances, highlighting the need for caution in generalizing about the situation of street youth in different countries.

N2  - Purpose: To describe use of health services and self-reported access to regular and emergency care by homeless adolescents and street youth. Method(s): Interviewer-administered surveys addressed use of health services, availability of sources of care for emergencies, and types of care sources used. An abbreviated version of the questionnaire used for youth in shelters was used for street youth. A nationally representative sample of 640 sheltered youth and a purposive sample of 600 street youth aged 12-21 years were interviewed. All data were collected in 1992. Result(s): Half of street youth and 36% of sheltered youth did not have a regular source of health care (p <= .05). One-fourth of street youth and 18% of sheltered youth also reported serious health problems within the past year (p <= .05). Street youth were more likely than sheltered youth to have used emergency treatment (36% vs. 29%; p <= .05) and alcohol- or drug-related emergency treatment (25% vs. 13%; p <= .05). Sheltered youth with a regular source of care were more likely to use nonemergency sites than those without a source of primary care (46% vs. 20%; p <= .001). Few sheltered or street youth perceived shelter clinics, clinics for runaway youth, or free youth clinics to be available to meet their emergency care needs. Conclusion(s): Significant numbers of homeless youth did not have a regular source of health care. Those who had a regular source of care were more likely to have continuity between routine and emergency care. Integration of health services with other agencies serving youth in shelters or on the street may improve access to care for those without a routine source of care and provide better continuity for these high-risk youth.

N2  - Background. In the light of rising human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) incidence rates amongst women in Western Europe, a multicentred, cross-sectional study was undertaken to explore the multitude of possible factors associated with HIV in a population of female injecting drug users (IDU). Methods. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 1198 female IDU recruited from a variety of settings in Paris, Madrid, Rome, London and Berlin. Their HIV status was determined from antibody testing of blood or saliva samples or from written confirmation of HIV test results from a physician. A hierarchical logistic regression model was used to identify direct and indirect associations between socio-economic factors, marginalization and risk behaviour with HIV prevalence. Results. The HIV prevalence in the sample of female IDU was 27.8% (range: 1.4% in London and 52.6% in Madrid). Factors independently associated with HIV prevalence in the regression analysis included: age >25 years (OR = 2.0-2.9), left full-time education before age 14 (OR = 2.4), no fixed address (OR = 2.2), previous imprisonment (OR = 1.4), commercial sex (OR = 1.3), having a regular HIV positive sexual partner (OR = 6.6), ever shared needles (OR = 1.5) and any sexually transmitted disease (STD) infection in the last year (OR = 1.7). Conclusions. The sexual behaviour and partners of female IDU in Western Europe are as important a component in explaining the HIV epidemic in this population as other risk factors, including high-risk drug taking behaviour. Homeless IDU women may be an important residual risk group warranting future preventive interventions and women with a history of STD should be a particular target for health education. Differences in HIV prevalence across cities are very large and may be related to differences in harm reduction policies.

N2  - Objective - The present paper represents the second part of a larger review on the studies assessing needs for care in mental health field. In the first part, studies assessing needs for services in the general population were reviewed. In this second part studies assessing needs on individual level were reviewed and the role played by the assessment of individual needs in planning mental health care was discussed. Methods - Studies published in international literature from January 1980 to June 1999 were reviewed. The studies were located through a computerised search of the databases MEDLINE and PsycLit; in addition, the reference lists of the studies located through the computerised search and the content of main international psychiatric journals were manually scanned in order to avoid possible omissions. Studies assessing needs in the general population and in psychiatric patients were reviewed separately. The latter were reviewed on the basis of the diagnostic category (psychotic and non psychotic patients) and setting of care (outpatients and inpatients). Studies on particular categories, such as homeless, children and adolescents, elderly and patients with aggressive behaviour, have been also reviewed. Results - Psychotic patients show a wide range of both clinical and social needs. Patients followed by community-based mental health services show similar number of clinical and social needs, while inpatients (with the exception of acute patients) show more social needs. For both community-based mental health patients and inpatients, social needs are most frequently unmet and psychopharmacological treatments are used more frequently than psychotherapeutic or rehabilitative interventions. Non psychotic patients show lower number of needs than psychotic patients; these needs are both clinical and social, with a higher total number of clinical needs, but a higher number of unmet social needs. Conclusions - Studies on needs for care provide an interesting perspective on people suffering from mental illness. In the routine clinical practice needs assessment could be a valuable tool for providing specific, individualised and effective mental health care.

N2  - Purpose: To explore data on high-risk male and female adolescents' attitudes towards female condoms, compared with male condoms. Method(s): Exploratory survey research was utilized with a convenience sample of 65 high-risk adolescents at an emergency homeless shelter. A peer-led intervention was conducted and pre-test and post-test interviews explored barriers to female condom use. The intervention consisted of 15- to 30-minute small group sessions, discussing female condoms' construction; purpose of the rings; efficacy preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection (STIs); and how to lubricate, insert, and use. Content and Chi-square analyses were utilized. Result(s): Sixty-three percent used male condoms as their primary contraceptive method; almost half (48%) said they always used male condoms, but 44% reported having sex without a male condom at least once in the 2 weeks prior to pre-test. Ninety-five percent had heard of the female condom, half 'good' and 24% 'bad' things, but only 15% had ever used one. At post-test all respondents gave reasons they might use female condoms in the future, and 77% gave reasons why they might not. Most (73%) adolescents said they would still prefer the male to the female condom. The major potential barriers to adolescents' female condom use were not having female condoms available and/or females feeling uncomfortable inserting them. Conclusion(s): Female condoms should be offered to adolescents as an additional choice rather than as replacements for male condoms. Further research is needed to assure access, availability, and comfort with female condoms and male participation in their use. Copyright (C) 2000 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

N2  - Context. - A program of home visitation by nurses has been shown to affect the rates of maternal welfare dependence, criminality, problems due to use of substances, and child abuse and neglect. However, the long-term effects of this program on children's antisocial behavior have not been examined. Objective. - To examine the long-term effects of a program of prenatal and early childhood home visitation by nurses on children's antisocial behavior. Design. - Fifteen-year follow-up of a randomized trial. Interviews were conducted with the adolescents and their biological mothers or custodial parents. Setting. - Semirural community in New York. Participants. - Between April 1978 and September 1980, 500 consecutive pregnant women with no previous live births were recruited, and 400 were enrolled. A total of 315 adolescent offspring participated in a follow-up study when they were 15 years old; 280 (89%) were born to white mothers, 195 (62%) to unmarried mothers, 151 (48%) to mothers younger than 19 years, and 186 (59%) to mothers from households of low socioeconomic status at the time of registration during pregnancy. Intervention. - Families in the groups that received home visits had an average of 9 (range, 0-16) home visits during pregnancy and 23 (range, 0-59) home visits from birth through the child's second birthday. The control groups received standard prenatal and well- child care in a clinic. Main Outcome Measures. - Children's self-reports of running away, arrests, convictions, being sentenced to youth corrections, initiation of sexual intercourse, number of sex partners, and use of illegal substances; school records of suspensions; teachers' reports of children's disruptive behavior in school; and parents' reports of the children's arrests and behavioral problems related to the children's use of alcohol and other drugs. Results. - Adolescents born to women who received nurse visits during pregnancy and postnatally and who were unmarried and from households of low socioeconomic status (risk factors for antisocial behavior), in contrast with those in the comparison groups, reported fewer instances (incidence) of running away (0.24 vs 0.60; P = .003), fewer arrests (0.20 vs 0.45; P = .03), fewer convictions and violations of probation (0.09 vs 0.47; P<.001), fewer lifetime sex partners (0.92 vs 2.48; P= .003), fewer cigarettes smoked per day (1.50 vs 2.50; P = .10), and fewer days having consumed alcohol in the last 6 months (1.09 vs 2.49; P = .03). Parents of nurse-visited children reported that their children had fewer behavioral problems related to use of alcohol and other drugs (0.15 vs 0.34; P = .08). There were no program effects on other behavioral problems. Conclusions. - This program of prenatal and early childhood home visitation by nurses can reduce reported serious antisocial behavior and emergent use of substances on the part of adolescents born into high-risk families.

T1  - Cocaine and crack in Amsterdam: Diverging subcultures
A1  - Nabben T.
A1  - Korf D.J. 
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Recreational cocaine use spread rapidly in Amsterdam at the end of the 1970s, particularly as a 'party drug' in clubs and discotheques. At the end of the 1980s, the role of cocaine as party drug was largely taken over by ecstasy. In contrast, first cocaine and then crack cocaine increased in popularity among heroin addicts and marginalized street youth, including homeless youth and young prostitutes. Today, experimental use of crack is also observed among young people from socially deprived neighborhoods, especially among ethnic minorities. This article describes, mainly on the basis of ethnographic studies among these groups, the evolving and diverging patterns of use among trendsetting party youth and their marginalized counterparts. Important differences maybe observed between groups related to socio-economic background, the role cocaine plays in their lives, transmission routes, and different operating market mechanisms influenced by drug policy. For party youth, cocaine use mainly serves recreational purposes. In contrast, for problem youth, cocaine, and now especially crack, contribute to multi-problem behavior within the context of their marginalized lifestyles.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Objective: To establish the mental health needs of homeless children and families before and after rehousing. Design(s): Cross sectional, longitudinal study. Setting(s): City of Birmingham. Subjects: 58 rehoused families with 103 children aged 2-16 years and 21 comparison families of low socioeconomic status in stable housing, with 54 children. Main Outcome Measure(s): Children's mental health problems and level of communication; mothers' mental health problems and social support one year after rehousing. Result(s): Mental health problems remained significantly higher in rehoused mothers and their children than in the comparison group (mothers 26% v 5%, P = 0.04; children 39% v 11%, P = 0.0003). Homeless mothers continued to have significantly less social support at follow up. Mothers with a history of abuse and poor social integration were more likely to have children with persistent mental health problems. Conclusion(s): Homeless families have a high level of complex needs that cannot be met by conventional health services and arrangements. Local strategies for rapid rehousing into permanent accommodation, effective social support and health care for parents and children, and protection from violence and intimidation should be developed and implemented.

T1  - Side effects of alternative iron supplementation: a pilot study
A1  - Roth J.L.
A1  - Pugh L.C. 
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Iron deficiency anemia is a significant health problem for women. An intervention utilizing home visits by a nurse and the intake of alternate iron supplements was examined. Outcome measures of hematocrit levels and side effects are reported in this manuscript. Ten African-American inner city homeless women in transitional housing agreed to participate in this longitudinal study. Each participant was encouraged to take the alternate iron supplements for a three month period. Hematocrit values increased from recruitment through the third month. A paired t-test was significant (t value -5.39; df, 9; p < .0001). In addition, the side effect of fatigue decreased from recruitment through the third month. A paired t-test was significant (t value 3.18: df, 7: p = .015). During the weekly and monthly visits, when the subjects were asked if the supplements had any effect on their feelings of well-being, two women stated they had "little effects." In terms of side effects there were no complaints of nausea, stomach ache, or black tarry stools. Of the approximately 12 visits to each subject, constipation was reported only two times by two subjects. While the women did not report black stools they did offer that the vitamins seemed to color their stools green (three reported it one time and two subjects reported it three times). The benefits and the lack of side effects may have far-reaching implications for client populations such as the elderly and pregnant women who typically have difficulty with anemia and constipation alike. The weekly visits by the nurse may have added to the compliance and success of this program.

N2  - The long-term effects of two culturally competent AIDS education programs with different content on the risk behavior and AIDS-related knowledge of 410 homeless African American women 2 years after program completion were examined. Participants were members of a larger cohort of impoverished African American and Latina women recruited in Los Angeles from 1989 to 1991. Of a subsample of 527 African American women selected randomly for a 2-year follow-up interview, 410 (78%) were located and agreed to participate. Women participating in both AIDS education programs reported reduced HIV risk behaviors and demonstrated greatly improved AIDS knowledge at 2-year follow-up (p < .001). Women in a specialized program were less likely than those in a traditional program to report noninjection drug use at 2 years. Women in the traditional program had significantly better AIDS knowledge at follow-up (p < .001). These findings suggest that educational programs can produce sustained benefits among impoverished women.

Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Compared a probability sample of 118 homeless adolescents (ages 12-17) from 6 shelters from throughout the 7-county Detroit metropolitan area to a matched sample of 118 housed adolescents using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC), which yields diagnoses based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed., rev.; DSM-III-R; American Psychiatric Association, 1987) criteria, and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Adolescents in the housed comparison group were matched on age, sex, race, and neighborhood characteristics. Analyses, including ones controlling for a set of 10 risk and resilience factors, indicated that the homeless showed more disruptive behavior disorders and alcohol abuse or dependence on the DISC and greater levels of symptomatology on the BSI. There were no significant group differences on drug abuse or affective disorders, and psychotic disorders were rare in both groups. This pattern of findings is not entirely consistent with popular stereotypes about homeless youth nor with many existing studies (which have often failed to include an appropriate comparison group).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This is a study to evaluate friendships in latency street boys of Porto Alegre, RGS, Brazil. METHOD(S): A sample of 30 latency street boys was compared with a sample of 51 latency boys living with their low income families, using the Cornell Interview of Peers and Friends (CIPF). RESULT(S): The two groups had a significantly different CIPF global scores, and the boys of the street group had the highest mean score. Also, boys of the street had significantly lower developmental appropriateness, self-esteem and social skills scores than boys living with a family. CONCLUSION(S): The urgent need for intervention street children, especially on boys of the street, is emphasized.

T1  - Homeless parents: parenting education to prevent abusive behaviors
A1  - Gorzka P.A. 
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - PROBLEM: This study sought to measure the effects of a short-term parenting course for homeless parents to decrease their parenting stress and potential for abusive parenting behaviors. SAMPLE: Nineteen homeless parents lived in a family emergency shelter for homeless families in Hillsborough County, FL. Their average length of shelter stay was 3 weeks. METHOD(S): Residents were invited to participate in a parenting education course consisting of three 1-hour classes weekly for 3 consecutive weeks. Class content focused on the parent, the child, and discipline. Subjects' potential for child abuse was measured with the Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory and their parenting stress with the Parenting Stress Index. A quasi-experimental pre/posttest design was used, with a t test statistic at the .05 level of significance. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze selected demographic data. FINDINGS: Results revealed significant differences in the scores of parenting stress originating from the child domain of the PSI and in the scores on the construct of unrealistic expectations of the child in the AAPI. Both scores had decreased on the posttest. CONCLUSION(S): Short-term parenting education courses may be a useful intervention strategy.

N2  - This study examined the relationship between social support and the ability of Brazilian adolescents to adapt to life on the streets. Participants included thirty male street children in Rio de Janeiro. These youths, and a comparison group, were 13 to 18 years old. It was hypothesized that street children with more social support would adapt better to life on the streets. It was also hypothesized that street children with higher quality support would adapt better. Findings indicated that neither quantity nor quality of social support was related to adaptation. The implications of these findings with regard to the resiliency of street children are discussed.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - School dropouts are considered an important target group for AIDS prevention. They are expected to be less knowledgeable about AIDS and to show a higher degree of risky behavior as compared with their school-attending peers. Several small-scale studies among specific groups of dropouts seem to confirm such expectations. However, due to differences in methodology, it is often difficult to compare the results of such studies with findings for youths who have not dropped out of school. The present study sought to remedy this by examining AIDS-related knowledge, attitudes, and behavior among comparable samples of Dutch secondary school students and dropouts (excluding homeless and drug-addicted adolescents). The two groups were compared with regard to knowledge about AIDS prevention, attitude toward condom use, intention to use condoms, sexual history, and condom use. Contrary to expectations, few differences were found. It was concluded that, in most respects, dropouts are similar to those who have remained in school.

N2  - This study characterizes subcultural differences within an inner-city street youth population. Variations in residential status, subsistence patterns, and service utilization according to peer group affiliation were explored. A brief structured interview was administered to 752 youth, ages 12 to 23 years, who had been living on the streets for two or more consecutive months, or who were fully integrated into the "street economy." Subjects were recruited for the study using a stratified probability sampling design, with 30% recruited from community-based service sites and 70% from street locations and at natural "hang-outs." Five street youth groups were identified: "punks/skinheads," "druggies," "hustlers," "gang members," and "loners." The results demonstrated unique patterns with respect to places stayed/slept, means of financial support and economic subsistence, and use of available services according to peer group affiliation. The implications of these findings and recommendations for future research and service provision are discussed.

N2  - Elopement is a dangerous behavior because children who run away may encounter life-threatening situations (e.g., traffic). We conducted functional analyses of the elopement of 3 children who had been diagnosed with developmental disabilities. The results identified a maintaining reinforcer for the elopement of 1 child, but the data were difficult to interpret for 2 of the children. Subsequent reinforcer assessments were used to help to clarify the reinforcers for elopement for these 2 children. Results of the functional analyses and reinforcer assessments then were used to develop successful treatments to reduce elopement. The findings are discussed in terms of (a) the application of functional analysis methodology to elopement, (b) the use of reinforcer assessments to identify potential reinforcers when standard functional analyses are undifferentiated, and (c) the utility of assessment-based treatments for elopement.

T1  - A comparative study of homeless, previously homeless, and never homeless school-aged children's health
A1  - Menke E.M.
A1  - Wagner J.D. 
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to compare the mental health, physical health, and healthcare practices of homeless, previously homeless, and never homeless poor school-aged children. The sample was comprised of 134 children who ranged in age from 8 to 12 years. The children participated in health assessments and completed two psychometric tests: the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) (Kovacs, 1985) and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) (Reynolds & Richmond, 1985). Their mothers completed the Child Behavior Problem Checklist (CBCL) (Achenbach, 1991) and participated in an interview. The homeless (n = 67), previously homeless (n = 30), and never homeless children (n = 37) were similar in regard to their health assessment findings, reported health problems, healthcare practices, and CBCL scores. The proportions of homeless and previously homeless children with CDI scores in the clinical range were significantly greater than the never homeless poor children. The homeless children had significantly higher anxiety scores than the previously homeless and never homeless children. All three groups of children were at risk for physical and mental health problems; however, the findings suggest that school-aged children who experience homelessness may be at greater risk for depression and anxiety than never homeless poor children.

The review included an analysis of birth and death certificates and medical record data; maternal interviews; review of cases and development of recommendations by provider panels; and convening of community groups to develop strategies to improve the health and health care of women and infants. The review focused on 287 infant deaths during 1990- 1993. More than half of all neonatal deaths were attributable to 'previable' or 'borderline viable' births. Sexually transmitted infections were the most frequently identified underlying risk, and smoking was the most frequently identified prenatal risk. Homelessness, physical and sexual abuse, and alcohol use were at least twice as likely among women whose babies died than among a high risk comparison group. Panelists identified fragmented health care over the course of women's reproductive lives as a predominant theme. The authors conclude that: (a) The focus of maternal and child health care should shift to a model of women's health care that addresses the chronicity of social and clinical risks. (b) Infant mortality reviews are a valuable tool for community education, systems review, and policy development and can be applied to other public health ssues with local significance. (c) Expectations about the review process's ability to produce conclusions about causality or recommendations narrowly geared to reducing infant mortality rates need to be reframed. (d) The model will be strengthened by greater participation of families affected by infant death.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Adolescents (N = 482) at elevated risk for sexually-transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, were assessed on theoretically-derived measures of knowledge and attitudes toward precautionary behavior, frequencies of high risk sexual and substance use behaviors, and other psychosocial factors implicated in adolescents' risky behavior such as impulsivity, risk-taking propensity, and social support. The adolescent samples included drug- dependent adolescents (n = 77), incarcerated youth (n = 194), homeless and runaway youth (n = 55), and urban African-American adolescents (n = 156). Drug-dependent and incarcerated youth evidenced exceedingly high HIV-risk and less favorable psychosocial profiles, with drug-dependent females reporting the highest levels of overall risk. Youth in homeless shelters were lower in HIV-risk and had more favorable psychosocial profiles than drug-dependent and incarcerated youth and were slightly higher on these measures than African- American youth sampled from the community. Gender differences varied by sample. Findings suggest that HIV prevention programs for high-risk youth should be tailored according to gender and the specific type of high-risk audience involved. Implications of the findings for tailoring risk reduction interventions for each group of at-risk adolescents are discussed.

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Objective: To assess HIV-related drug and sex risk behaviors and evaluate factors associated with change in risk behaviors among runaway and homeless adolescents, 244 street youth were recruited from a community drop-in center serving high-risk youth. Method(s): Using a cross-sectional design, approximately half of study participants received training in a peer-based intervention that included principles derived from the health belief model, while the remaining subjects received no intervention. Subjects were interviewed at baseline, immediately following the intervention (for those receiving the training) and 3 months later. Logistic regression and analysis of covariance were used to analyze intervention effects. Result(s): Compared to youth in the control condition, runaways receiving the intervention significantly increased their knowledge about HIV. Contrary to the health belief model, in multivariate analyses knowledge and greater perceived chance for HIV were associated with high risk behavior. On the other hand, lower concern about HIV infection was also associated with high risk behavior, supporting the health belief model. Conclusion(s): Despite the intervention's success in increasing knowledge of HIV and AIDS, the association between knowledge, perceived likelihood of infection and high risk behaviors suggest that, without other alternatives, runaways will maintain their risks. The association noted between lower concern and high risk behaviors underscores the challenge faced in developing effective interventions with this population.

N2  - Objective: To describe tuberculosis infection among persons experiencing homelessness in inner Melbourne, Australia. Design(s): Homeless people were surveyed during late 1995 and early 1996. In stage one of the study 284 homeless people from crisis and long-term accommodation sites were recruited by means of stratified, systematic, random sampling. In stage two a convenience sample of 100 homeless people from squats and the streets were recruited. Participants completed a questionnaire and Mantoux testing was performed. Result(s): A past history of tuberculosis was reported by 3%. Thirty-seven per cent had a Mantoux >=10 mm; 21% >=15 mm; and 11% >=20 mm. A Mantoux >=15 mm was independently associated with being aged >=40 years, coming from the accommodated sample, overseas birth, and a past history of tuberculosis. Using logistic regression modelling, a Mantoux >=15 mm was predicted by being aged >=40 years, overseas birth, and past history of tuberculosis. Conclusion(s): Mantoux test results suggest that this group of homeless people had a high prevalence of infection with the tubercle bacillus. Many aspects of the physical and social circumstances of homeless people predispose to reactivation and have the potential to enhance rapid spread should latent infection become active disease.

T1  - Sexually transmitted infections in adolescents
A1  - Cowan F.M. 
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Sexually transmitted infections (STI) are a major cause of mortality and morbidity throughout the developing and industrialized world. STIs are important both because of their direct effect on the health of men and women and because of their facilitatory effect with regards to HIV transmission. Young people, in particular young women, appear to have high rates of STI compared to adults. This increased vulnerability to infection is due to a number of biological, behavioural, psychological and social factors including: hormonal changes at puberty, cervical anatomy, immunological naivety, and inability to recognize symptoms of infection. Other factors may be sexual experimentation (including experimentation with same-sex partners), non-consensual sex, lack of perception of risk, immaturity of communication skills, contraception choice, poor health seeking behaviour, homelessness, prostitution, lack of teen-friendly health care services, parental involvement and alcohol or illicit substance use. The adverse sequelae that occur as a consequence of STIs are particularly devastating in adolescents. Teenagers have their entire reproductive future at risk and jeopardize their fertility by infection. Effective prevention strategies specifically directed at adolescents need to be designed and evaluated.

T1  - Health services to children resident in domestic violence shelters

A1  - Ferguson T.
A1  - Webb E. 
Y1  - 1998//
N2  - Objective. To determine immunization and pre-school surveillance coverage of children who had been resident in a refuge for women victims of domestic violence. Design. A retrospective audit of immunization and surveillance coverage. Setting. A women's refuge in Cardiff, UK. Subjects. Seventy-one children, resident in one refuge during a given year. Main outcome measures. Immunization status and uptake of pre-school surveillance recorded on the Child Health System compared with age corrected figures for the whole district and a general practice in a socio-economically deprived area of Cardiff. Results. Immunization and pre-school surveillance were significantly lower in the refuge group than in either control group. Conclusion. These children had poor access to health care services, in this instance leaving them vulnerable to preventable infectious diseases and the sequelae of late diagnosis of remediable physical and developmental problems. This mirrors the situation of the wider group of the 'homeless' to which they belong, but they also have the burden of the violence from which their mothers have fled. These children, to whom the 'Inverse Care Law' seems to apply, deserve further study of their health status. They are one of several marginalized groups who remain 'budget unattractive' to general practitioners and whose health and health care seems at risk owing to the erosion of the public health role of the health visitor. Implications for practice. Commissioners, community child health departments and primary care teams need to establish partnerships with local refuges to improve health services. Further study of the health and health care needs of these children is indicated.

N2  - During the study's first stage, 284 homeless people from crisis and long-term accommodation sites were surveyed using stratified, systematic sampling. The second stage involved a survey of a convenience sample of 100 homeless people from squats and the streets. Participants completed a questionnaire, Mantoux testing was performed and blood taken for gamma-interferon assay, liver and renal function tests. The group's health status was poor, with 72% experiencing medical conditions in the preceding two years and 77% symptoms in the month prior to interview. Bronchitis, asthma and gastroenteritis were the most commonly reported conditions; productive and persistent coughing, shortness of breath and wheezing the commonest symptoms. Twenty-one per cent had Mantoux reactions 15 mm or greater, 28% a raised GGT and 19% a raised ALT. Seventy-seven per cent smoked, 74% were current drinkers, 28% had injected drugs at some time in their lives and 14% were regularly injecting drugs. Forty-four per cent had experienced mental illness, 49% of whom reported depression and 15% schizophrenia. Homeless people in Melbourne have poor health status and engage in behaviours that place their health at risk. The high number of respiratory and gastro-intestinal complaints, the high level of cigarette smoking and injecting drug use (IDU) and the proportion likely to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) are all issues with important health consequences. Participants recruited from the street had significantly poorer health and engaged in more risk behaviours than those from accommodation sites; those from the accommodated sample were more likely to be infected with Mtb.

N2  - Two instruments were used to evaluate an agency's type and availability of services for HIV-positive and at-risk adolescents, and to assess opinions concerning healthcare referral patterns. These instruments were administered to representatives of 22 agencies from 10 categories of healthcare services. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling was used to model ratings of interagency knowledge, referral patterns, and general satisfaction with services. We found that no agencies offered youth services for inpatient adolescent, specific mental health treatment or short-term residential drug treatment; however, few offered long-term residential substance abuse detoxification services (5%), outpatient drug maintenance (5%), HIV-specific inpatient services (9%), intensive day treatment for substance abusers (9%), HIV home care (14%), HIV hospice care (14%), inpatient medical services (14%), short- term shelters (14%), long-term housing (18%), HIV-specific clinical trials (18%), and dental services (23%). Barriers to expanding care included lack of funding, transportation, and lack of awareness among youths about services. A multidimensional scaling analysis identified a tight service cluster of two community health centers and the largest public hospital serving poor communities of color, as well as a relatively tight cluster of three service agencies located on the Boston Common serving homeless youths. A third service cluster consisted of two university-affiliated medical centers and one community health center. In conclusion, we found that many critical services for HIV-positive youths are relatively scarce. Multidimensional scaling provides a visual presentation of the relationships of network sites. This evaluation of services indicates a need for increased, accessible youth- oriented HIV services and suggests that linkages across the three distinct clusters of service providers should be solidified. These methodologies can be used to develop a generic model describing the stages of linkage formation in HIV care service networks.

N2  - An intensive case management intervention for homeless persons was evaluated by random assignment of 202 cases (involving 213 adults and 70 children) to the intervention or a control group. Full follow-up data (4 interviews; at baseline and at 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-ups) were available on 98 cases (105 adults and 37 children). The follow-up rates for the 2 groups were not significantly different. Based on 13 repeated measures analyses, there were 3 statistically significant linear time effects (indicating overall change across the follow-up period) and 3 linear Time x Condition interactions (indicating differential change over time for intervention vs. control participants). Regardless of condition, adult participants improved in terms of their experience of homelessness, as well as on physical health symptoms and stressful life events. Condition x Time interactions indicating positive intervention impact were observed on the quality of housing environments, stressful life events, and interviewer ratings of psychopathology.

N2  - HIV risk characteristics and sources of HIV information were examined in a sample of 430 sexually active street youth recruited in Seattle, Washington. Overall, 40% of these youth were living on the street or in a shelter at time of interview. The majority (80%) reported having multiple sex partners in the prior 30 days. Condom use was reported more frequently for non-main partners versus main partners. More than one-third had ever injected drugs and almost all reported use of alcohol or other substances. Basic HIV knowledge and recent exposure to HIV information were relatively high - 63% of street youth had received HIV information from two or more sources in the prior 3 months. Small media (e.g. brochures, flyers) were the most frequently-mentioned channel of HIV information (77%), followed by interpersonal (60%), and mass media sources (41%). HIV information from street-based small media had been received by 63% of the sample, and were the only specific source of HIV information to reach more than half of street youth. Significant differences in sources of HIV information were observed for gender and homeless status. Recent exposure to HIV information via small media channels was positively associated with several psychosocial variables pertaining to condom-use with the respondent's main sex partner, while exposure to any source was not related to variables associated with condom use with non-main partners. Implications of these findings for prevention communication campaigns targeting street youth are discussed.

N2  - Objectives. To identify risk and protective factors for family homelessness, a case-control study of homeless and low-income, never-homeless families, all female-headed, was conducted. Methods. Homeless mothers (n = 220) were enrolled from family shelters in Worcester, Mass. Low-income housed mothers receiving welfare (n = 216) formed the comparison group. The women completed an interview covering socioeconomic, social support, victimization, mental health, substance use, and health domains. Results. Childhood predictors of family homelessness included foster care placement and respondent's mother's use of drags. Independent risk factors in adulthood included minority status, recent move to Worcester, recent eviction, interpersonal conflict, frequent alcohol or heroin use, and recent hospitalization for a mental health problem. Protective factors included being a primary tenant, receiving cash assistance or a housing subsidy, graduating from high school, and having a larger social network. Conclusions. Factors that compromise an individual's economic and social resources are associated with greater risk of losing one's home.

T1  - Vulnerability on the streets: Female sex workers and HIV risk
A1  - Pyett P.M.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - In-depth interviewss were conducted with 24 purposively selected female sex workers who were perceived to be vulnerable to risks associated with their lifestyle and occupation. Brothel workers were found to be considerably less exposed to risk than the women working on the streets. Client resistance was the major obstacle to women maintaining safe sex practices. Physical threats and coercion from clients, the absence of legal protection for street workers, the workers' extreme social isolation and lack of community support added to the difficulties experienced by women in their attempts to insist on condoms for all sex services. Youth, homelessness and heavy drug use had contributed to women being at times even more vulnerable because they had less capacity to manage situations of potential violence or STD risk. Whether through sex work or in their private relationships, HIV remains a risk for some of these women. This study highlights the dangers associated with illegal sex work. While decriminalization of prostitution would reduce some of the dangers to which women were exposed and increase women's capacity to insist on safe sex practices, it is also important for community education programmes to address men's failure to accept responsibility for condom use when seeking the services of sex workers.

N2  - Objectives. To describe the characteristics of homeless and low-income preschool-aged children, and to identify family and environmental determinants of their behavior. Methods. An unmatched case-control design was used to recruit a sample of sheltered homeless families and a comparison group of low-income housed families who were never homeless in Worcester, Massachusetts. Seventy-seven sheltered homeless and 90 low-income housed mothers with preschool-age children were assessed using a comprehensive interview protocol. Information about mothers' housing, income, service use, parenting practices, and children's father was obtained. Data about children's background, health, and life events were included. Standardized instruments were administered to assess mothers' mental health and their children's behavior. Comparisons of homeless and low-income housed families were used to describe the sample of 167 preschoolers. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the association of various stressors, such as homelessness, and family factors with their behavior. Results. Although homeless preschoolers were significantly more likely to have experienced stressful life events, undergone a care and protection investigation, and been placed in foster care when compared with low income preschoolers, differences in adverse behaviors were minimal. Although homeless children scored higher than housed children on the internalizing, externalizing, and total problem score on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (52.5 vs 49.9, 54.8 vs 51.2, and 54.4 vs 51.1, respectively), approximately equal numbers of children from both groups scored in the clinical range. With regard to determinants of behavior, mothers' emotional status was one of the strongest independent predictors of negative behavioral outcomes on both subscales. Foster care placement and death of a child's friend were predictors of adverse internalizing behavioral outcomes on the CBCL. After controlling for housing status, parenting practices, child's age, child's history of physical abuse, and specific life stressors predicted adverse externalizing behavioral outcomes. For both subscales, housing status and behavior were only marginally associated in the multivariate model. Conclusions. Both homeless and low-income children experienced significant adversity in their lives, with homeless preschool children facing more stress. However, differences in behavior as measured by the CBCL were minimal. Mothers' emotional status, in addition to various stressors, strongly predict children's negative outcomes for both CBCL subscales. These findings emphasize the importance of preventive family-oriented interventions that address the needs of preschoolers and their mothers.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have addressed ocular disorders among the homeless and nonhomeless poor. METHOD(S): To better understand the health problems of the homeless, ophthalmic disorders were analyzed among 512 homeless and 413 nonhomeless poor individuals receiving vision-screening examinations in Los Angeles. RESULT(S): Significantly, more 4- to 17-year-old nonhomeless poor were diagnosed with uncorrected visual acuity worse than or equal to 20/50 without correction (p = 0.001), total refractive errors (p < 0.0005), astigmatism (p = 0.001), and myopia (p < 0.0005) than were a control group of 4- to 17-year-old homeless individuals. More homeless individuals had extraocular muscle imbalance (p < 0.040), but fewer had external eye diseases (p2 = 0.016) than the nonhomeless poor, when age adjusted. In addition, higher rates of glaucoma and cataracts were observed in both homeless and poor nonhomeless populations than in the general population. CONCLUSION(S): Health care professionals should provide vision screenings intended to detect these ocular disorders. Screening and correction of myopia and glaucoma, in particular, can greatly improve the quality of life for those treated.

T1  - Factors predisposing to suspected offending by adults with self-reported learning disabilities

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Background. This study investigated factors contributing to suspected offending behaviour by adults with a history of learning disabilities taken into custody at a city police station. Methods. Adults charged with offences, and/or leaving custody, during a defined period, were identified as having a possible learning disability using a four-item questionnaire. A comparison group, of similar age, sex and IQ, was identified from a database of young people with learning difficulties. Information was obtained on interview about each individual's medical, psychiatric, social and family histories and psychological assessments were undertaken. Results. In contrast to the comparison group, those in the 'offending' group were more likely to have a history of the following: losing contact with their father, forensic contact in one or more family members, past homelessness, illicit drug use, experiencing an excess of recent life events, self-reported behavioural problems at school, truancy, childhood police contact and contact with probation services. All had histories of repeated offending. There was also an increased rate of drug/alcohol dependence. Only two subjects in the study group had a full-scale IQ below 70. Conclusions. These differences would suggest that the presence of childhood behavioural problems, offending behaviour by other family members, family separation and other social disruption and the development of drug and alcohol related problems are potentially the most important factors in trying to understand why one group engaged in criminal behaviour. The offending group had many characteristics in common with general offending populations.

T1  - Families of homeless and runaway adolescents: A comparison of parent/caretaker and adolescent perspectives on parenting, family violence, and adolescent conduct

A1  - Hoyt D.R.
A1  - Ackley K.A. 
Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Objective: Almost all of what is known about the families of runaways and homeless adolescents is based on adolescent self-reports. The validity of such research is currently being questioned by policy makers. The purpose of this study was to compare runaway and homeless adolescent reports and parent/caretaker reports on measures of parenting, family violence, and adolescent conduct. Method(s): Reports of 120 runaway adolescents and their parents/caretakers from four Midwestern states were compared on measures of parental monitoring, parental warmth and supportiveness, parental rejection, physical and sexual abuse, and adolescent conduct. Comparison groups of nonrunaway adolescents and their mothers in two-parent and single-parent families from the same geographical area were also used for parenting and adolescent conduct measures. Result(s): The findings indicated that although there were significant differences in means between adults and adolescents regardless of runaway status, adults and adolescent reports were in the same direction and present similar portraits of families of runaway and homeless young people. Both the parents/caretakers and their runaway adolescents reported lower levels of parental monitoring and warmth and supportiveness and higher levels of parental rejection than comparison groups of nonrunaway families. Parents/caretakers and runaway adolescents reported high levels of family violence and sexual abuse. Similarly, they concur regarding conduct problems for the adolescents. Conclusion(s): The findings suggest that runaway and homeless adolescents accurately depict the troubled family situations that they choose to leave. The policy implications for recent debates involving criminalization and mandatory return to parental custody of homeless and runaway youth are discussed.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - Samples of adolescents from a homeless shelter (n = 62), detention center (n = 70), and two high schools in Anchorage, Alaska (n = 207) were surveyed regarding HIV risk, knowledge and attitudes. Participants from the three groups differed markedly in patterns of risk behavior, with delinquent and homeless youths consistently reporting higher levels of risky behavior than those in the comparison group. However, differences between the homeless and delinquent youth on risk behaviors, knowledge and attitudes, suggest that HIV prevention efforts are more likely to succeed if they address the specific needs of these populations. An unusual trend in alcohol and marijuana use was also uncovered among all three groups surveyed; regular use of marijuana was consistently reported as more frequent than regular alcohol use. Implications for future research and HIV prevention targeting homeless and delinquent youth in Alaska, and in general, are discussed.

Y1  - 1997//
N2  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that there are health and lifestyle issues among homeless persons that differentiate them from other segments of the population and that can be described as risk factors for homelessness. METHOD(S): This case-control study investigated health and lifestyle issues in a panel of patients visiting a health care clinic for homeless persons. The same information was collected from a panel of county indigent patients and an equal number of privately insured patients enrolled in a nearby academic family practice center. RESULT(S): We found significant differences among these three groups. Differences in health problems were evident, as significantly more homeless persons reported mental health, drug and alcohol abuse, and smoking problems. There were no differences in the prevalence of other general medical conditions as listed by the patients. Homeless persons were younger than the control group respondents and more likely to be male, a member of a minority group, and unmarried. The childhood experiences of homeless persons were distinctive; they were more likely to have lived in a group home or some other nonfamily situation, considered themselves to have been delinquent, run away from home, been expelled from school, or been placed in reform school. The same held true for having been in jail as an adult. They had significantly less education, their job experiences were in manual and unskilled arenas, and they were more likely to have a gambling problem. A continuum of risk also appeared in that for the most part the characteristics and experiences of the indigent group members ranked in frequency between those of the homeless and insurance groups. CONCLUSION(S): Causes of homelessness appear to be multifactorial. Issues related to mental health, alcohol, nicotine, and other drug and substance abuse could be responsible for their medical problems, whereas other lifestyle issues might be regarded as risk factors for homelessness.

T1  - Growth status of homeless Nepali boys: Do they differ from rural and urban controls?

A1  - Todd A.
A1  - Baker R. 
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - The rapid increase in numbers of homeless children in cities of the developed and developing world is a matter of grave concern. A multi-disciplinary study was undertaken to examine the health and lifestyles of the homeless in Nepal in comparison to other local children. Few studies have quantified the health of street-children in the developing world using anthropometric indicators, and to our knowledge this is the first to systematically compare the homeless with appropriate controls from both rural and urban areas. Heights and weights were measured for 307 six to fourteen year-old boys (ill homeless, 62 squatter, 82 privileged school and 52 village boys). Height for age (HAz), weight for age (WAz) and weight for height (WHz) z-scores relative to reference data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) were used as indicators of growth status. Stunting characterized all but the school-boys, but wasting was not observed. The homeless were less stunted than either poor squatter or village boys. On arrival on the streets, they were taller than village boys, and duration of homelessness had no effect on their growth status. Thus in terms of physical growth, and despite frequent health complaints, homeless boys in Nepal fare relatively better than control groups of poor urban and rural boys. Comparative studies which reveal some successful aspects of street-life show that urban homelessness may represent an appropriate response to circumstances of poverty.

T1  - Identifying adolescent runaways: the predictive utility of the personality inventory for children
A1  - Rohr M.E. 
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - This study investigated whether runaway behavior could be related to six problematic areas. Selected scales of the Personality Inventory for Children, representative of the six areas, were hypothesized to discriminate between an adolescent runaway group and a control group. Four scales correctly classified 95.1% of the runaway subjects and 100% of the control subjects with a total correct classification rate of 97.52%. It was further hypothesized that the runaway group was not significantly different from a known clinical group with moderate to severe psychopathology. Results indicated that the runaway group was not significantly different except on one scale, Delinquency (DLQ). On the DLQ scale the runaway group had a significantly higher mean score than the clinical group. Application and recommendations are presented.

T1  - A measurement of delinquency differences between a delinquent and nondelinquent sample: what are the implications?
A1  - Edwards W.J. 
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - The present study compared 532 adolescents being detained by country juvenile authorities to 354 adolescents attending public school in reference to the volume of delinquent activity committed for a period of one year prior to the survey. Four levels of delinquent activity were developed, ranging from minor offenses such as runaway behavior to serious offenses such as assault. Participants were also compared on how they responded to several Likert-type questions that measured factors associated with the inclination to commit delinquent acts (anomie, social bonding, delinquent peer association, labeling, and self-esteem). This comparison provided information on the multiple pathways to delinquency which suggested forms of intervention.

T1  - Drug use among street children in southern Brazil
A1  - Forster L.M.K.
A1  - Tannhauser M.
A1  - Barros H.M.T. 
Y1  - 1996//
N2  - We studied the self-reported activities engaged in by children found wandering on the streets of Porto Alegre, Brazil, aiming to describe their drug abuse habits and practice of thefts or mendicancy. One hundred-and-five youngsters, 6-18 years old, were interviewed in the streets. Although the external appearance of the interviewed children lacked cues as to their life-style differences, three diverse life-style characteristics were depicted among them. Almost 25% of the children lived with their families and went to school (FAMSCH) and 46% lived with their families but didn't go to school (FAM). The other 29% spent all day long and slept in the streets (STREET). The most frequently used drug for the total group of children was tobacco, followed by alcohol, with a much higher prevalence of use of both alcohol and tobacco among children from the STREET subgroup. Alcohol was used by more than 25% of the STREET children and tobacco by 58% of the children from this subgroup, in a regular (almost daily) basis. Less than 12% of the FAMSCH children used illicit drugs. Inhalants were the preferred drugs for illicit drug experimental use. Only 4% of the children attending school sniffed solvents in a regular basis. Regular abuse of inhalants was reported much more frequently by the STREET subgroup of children, reaching a prevalence of 40%. Self-report of marijuana smoking was described to be regular by 4% of the FAMSCH children and 26% by the STREET children. A significantly higher number of the children who lived with their families in comparison to the STREET children described work activities (selling food, washing cars or polishing shoes) while out in the streets. On the other hand the practice of thefts was self-reported mainly by the children from the STREET group and only by the ones who used illicit drugs. Children who lived with their families reported less mendicancy and thefts than STREET children. These results show that very poor children might spend many hours of the day by themselves in the streets of a big city accompanied by children who are never under adult supervision. In spite of being alone for some hours a day and making friends with others who might use drugs, having a family and regularly attending school decreases the risk of delinquent acts and drug use.

Y1  - 1995//
N2  - The aim of this prospective study was to identify the number of people with a possible learning disability suspected of having committed a criminal offence who were taken into police custody during a defined period of time. Between 18 January 1993 and 18 March 1993 992 people were taken into custody at Parkside Police Station, Cambridge, of whom 251 (25.3%) were screened by the custody officer using a brief questionnaire to ascertain the presence or absence of reading and writing difficulties and to see if they had received extra help at school or if they had attended a special needs school. Information on age, sex, suspected offence, disposal, if a solicitor assisted and incidence of homelessness was gathered from the custody reports. Eleven (4.4%) subjects screened had attended schools for children with moderate learning difficulties, while one (0.4%) suspect reported having attended a school for children with severe learning difficulties. A further 26 (10.4%) had attended schools for children with emotional or behavioural difficulties or a learning support unit within a mainstream school. Those detained who had attended a special needs school for children with learning difficulties were all male. They had a mean age of 23.0 years (SD = 5.0) compared to the mean age of all subjects of 26.5 years (SD = 11.6). They were more likely to have been suspected of having committed acquisitive offences than people who attended mainstream schools. In addition, they were more likely to be remanded in custody, or to be bailed, prior to appearing in court, in contrast with those from mainstream schools who were much more likely to be cautioned. Three (25%) of those who attended schools for children with learning difficulties had the assistance of a solicitor while in police detention. Two (16.7%) of those suspects who had attended a school for children with learning difficulties were homeless compared to 19 (8.0%) homeless suspects who had attended mainstream schools. These findings need to be considered when planning services for offenders. Existing or planned court diversion schemes should consider suspects with learning disabilities as well as those with other mental disorders. Health, probation and social services will be required if people with learning disabilities are to be diverted from the criminal justice system and the prison service should consider how to support a potentially vulnerable group if they are detained prior to trial or receive prison sentences.

N2  - Homeless adults often visit emergency departments and often leave dissatisfied. We tested whether compassionate care, by improving patient satisfaction, can alter subsequent use of emergency services. We identified 133 consecutive homeless adults visiting one inner-city emergency department who were not acutely psychotic, extremely intoxicated, unable to speak English, or medically unstable. Half were randomly assigned to receive compassionate contact from trained volunteers. All patients otherwise had usual care and were followed for repeat visits to emergency departments. We found that rates of use were high, with patients making an average of seven visits a year (0.60 per month). More than a third of all patients made two or more visits within two days of each other. The average number of visits per month after intervention was significantly lower for patients who received compassionate care (0.43 vs 0.65, p = 0.018). Analyses adjusting for each patient's previous rate of use confirmed that compassionate care led to a one third reduction in the number of return visits within one month (95% CI 14 to 40%). Compassionate management of selected homeless adults decreases repeat visits to the emergency department. One explanation is that patients tend to return frequently until they are satisfied with their treatment.

T1  - Risk factors for homelessness: A study of families of origin

Y1  - 1995//
N2  - Objective: This study's objective was to test the hypothesis that there are health issues and other factors in families of origin that have an association with, and may be risk factors for, homelessness. Method(s): This case control study identified risk factors in a group of homeless patients at a health clinic for the homeless. Two comparison groups from an academic family practice center were included. One comparison group was county indigent patients, and the other was patients who had health insurance. Result(s): Significant differences in families of origin among these three groups were identified. On univariate analysis, homeless persons were found to have an increased prevalence of alcoholism in the family of origin, earlier departure from the home, minority status, a self-described negative childhood, experiences of abuse as a child, high birth order in large families, less parental education, less-skilled parental occupations, less feeling of love in the childhood family, less likelihood of the father being in the home, more risk of the father having been in jail, and less identification with a religious group. Multivariate analysis revealed that compared to the study groups, the following family of origin factors were associated with homelessness; ethnic group, alcoholism, feeling loved as a child, and having one's father in jail. Conclusion(s): Homelessness is a multifactorial issue, but risk factors can be identified that may distinguish individuals at increased risk. Root causes may begin in childhood and be related to the family of origin.

T1  - HIV risk behavior among homeless adults
A1  - St Lawrence J.S.
A1  - Brasfreld T.L. 
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - .Very little information is available regarding HIV risk behavior among homeless adults despite increasing evidence that HIV infection disproportionately affects inner-city residents and disadvantaged populations. In the present study, adults (N = 94) entering a storefront medical clinic for the homeless completed an AIDS risk survey. The results suggest that homeless adults are engaging in sexual and substance-use behaviors that place them at high risk for HIV infection. Sixty-nine percent of the present sample was at risk for HIV infection from either 1) unprotected intercourse with multiple partners, 2) intravenous drug use (IVDU), 3) sex with an IVDU partner, or 4) exchanging unprotected sex for money or drugs. Many persons within the sample evidenced multiple risk factors: 45% reported at least two of the risk factors described above and 26% reported three or more risk factors. The results suggest there is an urgent need to develop and evaluate AIDS-prevention strategies for homeless adults.

T1  - Two views of homeless children's art: psychoanalysis and Parse's human becoming theory
A1  - Baumann S.L. 
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - In the past decade there has been a dramatic rise in the number of children living in shelters in the United States. The traditional literature suggests that these children are at risk for various developmental, educational, and health problems, and that they are in need of assistance. Psychoanalytic theory and Parse's human becoming theory have fundamentally different views of human nature and of human activities such as artistic expression. While both theories can contribute to the present understanding of the experience of children in shelters and provide frameworks for a shelter-based nursing practice, it is suggested in this article that psychoanalytic theory is reductionistic and prescriptive and may close rather than open new possibilities.

T1  - Evaluation of a peer-led drug abuse risk reduction project for runaway/homeless youths
A1  - Fors S.W.
A1  - Jarvis S. 
Y1  - 1995//
N2  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Drug Prevention in Youth risk reduction program that was implemented in shelters for runaway/homeless youths in the Southeastern United States. The program focuses on knowledge, attitudes and skills that can help this group of high risk young people minimize the serious negative consequences of drug abuse. An evaluation strategy was developed so comparisons could be made between peer-led, adult-led and non-intervention groups. Dependent samples t tests and least squares ANCOVAS were used to measure pretest-posttest differences both within and between groups. Results indicate that the peer-led groups were more successful than the other two groups, and that program effects were the most powerful with the youngest group of shelter clients. Process evaluation revealed important factors related to group leader training and group management. It is concluded that well-trained and motivated peer/near peer leaders have particularly valuable contributions to make with regard to drug abuse risk reduction for shelter clients.

Y1  - 1995//
N2  - This study was undertaken to determine the locomotor capability of kittens whose spinal cords were transected at birth. The postnatal development of reflex and goal-directed locomotion was examined during the first 5 postnatal months in kittens that received low thoracic spinal cord transections as newborns. Some spinal kittens developed aberrant quadrupedal forms of locomotion. The onset of quadrupedal locomotion, however, was delayed by 2-3 months compared to the normal kitten (42) and deteriorated by 5 months of age. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrated that the quadrupedal locomotion was abnormal. Although some step cycles were characterized by full weight support, the typical hindlimb step cycle of the best performing cat showed inadequate weight support and balance. No spinal cat was able to coordinate the hindlimbs with the forelimbs during overground locomotion on a runaway or during quadrupedal locomotion on a treadmill. Neuroanatomical tracing with WGA-HRP and immunocytochemical techniques showed no axonal regeneration or growth into or across the lesion sites. The aberrant form of quadrupedal locomotion developed without descending input to the caudal spinal cord. The variability in performance among animals suggested that compensatory strategies were important factors in the spinal kitten's achievement of quadrupedal locomotion. Hindlimb weight-supported stepping during quadrupedal locomotion in some animals underscored the capacity of the isolated caudal spinal cord to generate both rhythmical stepping movements and weight support. The maintenance of developmentally immature, but functional, hindlimb postures suggested that the development of the isolated caudal spinal cord was arrested in the absence of descending input.

N2  - In order to assess the need for drug-related services for at-risk youth, a survey was conducted among young people aged 12-17 years who, owing to severe family discord, were currently living away from home (homeless) or had experienced periods away from home in the past 12 months (potentially homeless). Prevalence of use and of potentially harmful levels of use of alcohol and other licit and illicit drugs were higher than in a comparative population. Of the 155 people interviewed, 54% reported past physical abuse, 28% reported past sexual abuse, and 73% had a family alcohol or other drug history. Of the total, 62% had been in a youth refuge at some time in the past 12 months. Twenty four per cent had been to hospital as a result of alcohol or other drug use and 45% had attempted suicide. Female sex and an interaction between sexual abuse and binge drinking predicted suicide attempts. This study points to the need for a comprehensive approach to interventions for troubled youth which gives greater recognition to mental health issues related to family circumstances, including abuse.

N2  - This study assessed the applicability of the transtheoretical model of behavior change (J.O. Prochaska & C.C. DiClemente, 1983, 1984) to the measurement of contraceptive use among 296 women at high risk for HIV infection and transmission. Structural equation modeling suggested that a measure of general contraceptive use could be used to assess use of oral contraceptives and hormonal implants but that measurement of condom use required separate assessments for main and other partners. Self-efficacy (SE) and decisional balance scales were internally consistent for general contraceptive use, for condom use with main partners, and for condom use with other partners. Consistent with research on other health behaviors, SE scores rose significantly across stages, from precontemplation to maintenance, and a shift in decisional balance was observed for 2 of 3 behaviors. This measurement strategy may enhance the ability to evaluate prevention programs for women at risk.

N2  - Study objective - To estimate the prevalence of active pulmonary tuberculosis in a homeless population in London and to assess whether those with suspected disease could be integrated into the existing health care system for further follow up and treatment. Design - Voluntary screening programme based on a questionnaire survey and chest x ray. Setting and cases - Screening programmes were set up over the Christmas period in 1992 and 1993 at a shelter for the homeless in London. An offer of screening was made to all individuals who visited the centre and an interviewer administered questionnaire was completed on those who volunteered for the screening. Chest x rays were carried out, developed, and read on site. Individuals with chest x ray features suggestive of tuberculosis or other medical problems were referred to a hospital of their choice. Results and outcome - In 1992 nearly 1600 people visited the centre, of whom 372 volunteered for the screening and 342 were x rayed. Nineteen of the 342 (5.6%) had radiological features suggestive of active tuberculosis. In 1993 around 2000 homeless people visited the centre, of whom 270 volunteered for the screening and 253 were x rayed. Eleven (4.3%) had features consistent with active tuberculosis on the basis of the chest x rays and clinical examination by a chest physician. Overall, of 595 people x rayed in the two surveys, 30 (5%) had changes suggestive of active tuberculosis. Further investigations confirmed nine (1.5%) with active pulmonary disease and eight with no active tuberculosis. In 13, the diagnosis was not determined as four declined further investigation and nine did not attend their hospital appointment. Conclusions - Tuberculosis among the homeless remains a cause for concern. Follow up and treatment present unique difficulties. Services for the homeless need to include mechanisms for timely diagnosis and monitored treatment. Control programmes designed for the needs of the homeless are required.

Y1  - 1994//
N2  - This study reports on the characteristics of street youth in treatment in Ontario. Data came from eleven substance abuse treatment programs. It was found that street youth in treatment had a larger number of social and drug abuse problems than did non-street youth. They were more likely to be unemployed, on welfare, and to have legal problems. They had more depression and lower self-esteem, and use more alcohol and drugs. Discharged street and non-street youth had similar lengths of stay and drop-out rates in one residential program and similar, although limited, amounts of treatment in outpatient programs. However, street youth were more likely to leave outpatient programs without telling staff. The need for more experimentation in the provision of service for youth is identified.

Y1  - 1994//
N2  - This study examines the differences in academic performance, adaptive functioning, and problem behaviors of 145 elementary school-age children who had experienced homelessness and a matched group of 142 mobile children with low socioeconomic status (SES). The Achenbach and Edelbrock Teacher Report Form and the Harter Self-Perception Profile for Children were used. Within groups, children displayed a range of academic and psychological functioning; about 30 percent performed in the normal range. Comparisons revealed no significant differences between homeless and low SES-mobile children. However, the children's scores taken together differed substantially from norms. These findings suggest that although homelessness is a stressful event in children's lives, long-term poverty may be a more appropriate marker of risk in children. Further, the findings imply that interventions must presume a substantial diversity of need within the various populations. A model of the dynamic of poverty, mobility, and lack of social supports is presented. Implications for intervention by schools and community agencies are discussed.

T1  - Criminal consequences of childhood sexual victimization
A1  - Widom C.S.
A1  - Ames M.A. 
Y1  - 1994//
N2  - Using a prospective cohorts design, we assess the long-term criminal consequences of childhood sexual abuse through an examination of official criminal histories for a large sample of validated cases of childhood sexual abuse, compared to cases of physical abuse and neglect and a control group matched for age, race, sex, and approximate family socioeconomic status. Compared to other types of abuse and neglect, early childhood sexual abuse does not uniquely increase an individual's risk for later delinquent and adult criminal behavior. Childhood sexual abuse victims were at increased risk of arrest as a juvenile for being a runaway. As adults, child sexual abuse victims were at higher risk of arrest for sex crimes than controls, as were victims of physical abuse and neglect. Childhood sexual abuse victims were more likely to be arrested for prostitution as adults than other abuse and neglect victims and controls, regardless of gender. However, there was no support for a direct relationship among child sexual abuse, arrests for running away in adolescence, and adult arrests for prostitution. The findings also suggest an association for males between physical abuse and arrests for violent sex crimes (rape and/or sodomy). Caution is needed in interpreting these findings because of exclusive reliance on official record data and the possible impact of agency intervention.

N2  - Despite widespread recognition that young people are especially prone to experiment with sex and drugs, studies on social aspects of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have paid little attention to unemployed youth. Recent examinations of the specific situation of homeless Australian youth reveal high levels of risky behaviours. This study treats homeless Sydney youth as a subgroup of the unemployed, comparing AIDS-related beliefs and behaviours across three levels of living situation - homeless, refuge-based and home-based. Results show no significant differences in relevant knowledge between the groups, though levels of sexual and drug injection activity differ very significantly, the homeless being most active and the home-based least. Percentages of condom use within sexual activity do not differ, however. We conclude that it is neither knowledge nor practice of safe sex in itself which places the homeless at particular risk, but their high frequency of sexual encounters and of drug injecting.

T1  - AIDS vulnerability of homeless youth
A1  - Lhuede D.

Y1  - 1994//
N2  - This study investigated the relationships between sexual and intravenous drug risk-taking activities, perceptions of vulnerability to HIV infection, attitudes to HIV/AIDS precautions and knowledge of risk among a sample of 80 homeless youth aged between 15 and 20 years. There was evidence of high levels of risky sexual behaviour, with over 80 percent of the sample never or only sometimes using condoms during vaginal intercourse, and around one-quarter reporting irregular or no condom use during anal intercourse. Intravenous drug-use activity rates were also high, with nearly half the sample having experimented with IV drugs and about one-quarter still using them. The use of precautionary measures was inconsistent, and, with respect to drug-use, often incorrect. Homeless youth perceived their risks of becoming infected with HIV as very low, despite their behaviours. Using multiple regression, perceived vulnerability to HIV infection was significantly predicted by drug use behaviour (F = 1.93, p = 0.04), but not by risky sexual behaviour, indicating that these young people do not regard their sexual activities as dangerous. Sexual risk with a regular partner was significantly predicted by negative attitudes toward sexual precautions (such as condoms), age and sex, with older homeless youth and females being more at risk (F = 3.76; p < 0.001). Sexual risk with casual partners and drug-risk behaviour were not predicted by attitudes to precautions or knowledge of them, indicating that we need to go beyond these variables and look more intensively at contextual factors inherent in the life-styles of this population.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to develop a national perspective on the sexual activity of street youth in Canada and to determine the correlates of risky sexual behavior according to street youth's link to the street. Five categories of street youth (sex industry workers, heavy drug and/or alcohol users, young offenders, homeless and unemployed) ages 15 to 20 years were recruited in 1988 from 10 Canadian urban centers to participate in a 45- minute structured interview focusing on knowledge and attitudes regarding sexually transmitted diseases (STD)/human immunodeficiency virus, current sexual practices, sexual and STD history, demographic background, alcohol/drug use and relationship with parents and peers. Data from the survey were also compared with findings from more than 15 000 non-street youth adolescents surveyed in the same year with the use of parallel questionnaires. Of 712 street youth surveyed (391 males, mean age 17.3 years; 321 females, mean age 16.8 years), the majority were sexually active (95% males, 93% females) and 22% reported at least one previous STD (16% males, 30% females). The lowest STD rates were in unemployed males (5%) and the highest (68%) in female sex industry workers. STD/human immunodeficiency virus high risk behaviors were frequent with 47% of males and 41% of females having had at least 10 different partners, 73% of males and 75% of females inconsistently using condoms and 22% of males and 24% of females participating in anal intercourse. Even among sex industry workers more than 40% used condoms inconsistently. Among male sex industry workers, 63% of whom had engaged in anal intercourse, regular condom use was associated with a lower reported STD history (36%) than in those with inconsistent condom use (61%). Major factors that increase the prevalence of infection, namely efficiency of transmission and mean rate of partner change, are operative among street youth. Improving rates of consistent condom use is most likely to have the greatest impact on STD in this population.

N2  - Methods: From June 1989 to April 1991, 394 adolescents aged 10-18 years randomly selected upon admission at a state shelter in Belo Horizonte, Brazil underwent health history interview, physical examination, serology for HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis, and stool examination. Participants were classified as street-based youths (n = 195) or home-based youths (n = 199). The age distribution was similar in both groups, although males were overrepresented among street-based youths (79.5% versus 62.3%). Result(s): Compared with home-based youths, street-based youths reported earlier onset (p = 0.009) and higher rates of sexual activity (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-3.3), sexual abuse (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.2- 10.1), and sexually transmitted diseases (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3-6.6). Overall condom use was low in both groups. Street-based youths were 7.8 times more likely to use drugs than home-based youths (95% CI, 4.9-12.7). Inhalants and marijuana were the more commonly used drugs. Intravenous drug use was low. Conclusion(s): Although chronic malnutrition and multiple parasitosis were common findings in both groups, street-based youths were more likely to present disorders related to trauma and poor hygienic conditions. Antibodies to HIV were detected in four (2%) street-based youths and in none of the home-based youths. This study confirms that street youths are at higher risk for HIV infection than their home-based peers and indicates a need for HIV prevention programs targeting this population.

Y1  - 1994//
N2  - Study Objective: The extent to which maternity homes across our nation provide services for homeless, pregnant girls is unknown. We initiated the first investigation to identify and describe all of the group residential facilities in the United States for pregnant adolescents under the age of 18 years. Design(s): We created a national list of maternity homes on a state-by-state basis through information gathered from local human services departments, local WIC offices, and from maternity homes that were aware of others in their region. We contacted an official at each maternity home by telephone to confirm the nature of the facility and to seek their participation in the project by answering a 28-item questionnaire to be sent by mail. Unreturned questionnaires were followed by a reminder letter and a duplicate questionnaire. The collected data were then organized and tabulated. Result(s): From all 50 states, we found and contacted by telephone 215 maternity homes admitting girls under the age of 18 years (the number of homes ranged from 19 in California, to 0 in Wyoming) and a total of 174 (81%) completed and returned our postal questionnaire. Of responding homes, 10% had been in operation 100 years or more, 29% admitted girls dependent on illicit drugs or alcohol, 59% functioned as part of a larger organization, 20% were unlicensed, 89% received private donations, 23% received federal funds, and 42% offered private rooms. The most frequent maternal bed capacity was eight. Typically they had from two to four full-time employees. Benefits provided included childbirth classes (84%), social services (90%), dietary counseling (49%), accredited, on-site schooling (35%), and vocational training (54%). Prenatal care was mostly provided through private physicians (63%) and hospital-based prenatal clinics (59%), with 99% of deliveries in hospitals. The most frequent age of residents was 16 years, staying an average of 4.7 months antepartum and 2.4 months postpartum. The most frequent maximum allowed length of stay was up to 9 months. The mean number of babies born per responding home in 1991 was 29.4. Conclusion(s): In the United States, maternity homes for adolescents are an important source of services for approximately 6,000 pregnant teens each year.

N2  - The effect of gender, ethnicity, and homelessness on the locus of control orientations of 113 participants in a job training program in the United States was investigated. It was expected that homeless women of color (Black and Hispanic) would have the strongest perception that powerful others influenced their lives. The Black participants tended to believe more strongly in the influence of chance and powerful others than the White participants did.

N2  - The prevalence of psychological maladjustment in homeless adolescents (n = 54) was compared to a control group (n = 58) in Brisbane, Australia using the Youth Self-Report Scale [1]. Overall, 74% of the homeless group and 22.4% of the control group scored within the clinical range on one or more of the clinical subscales. There was considerable diversity of symptomatology in the homeless group. Less than half of the homeless group were within the clinical range on both the delinquent subscale and the thought disorder subscale. Depressive, Aggressive and Somatic Complaints were also prevalent. The study challenges preconceived notions of a simple relationship between adolescent homelessness and delinquency, and draws attention to the psychological needs of this group of adolescents.

Measurements and Main Results: Twelve percent of patients (16 of 135) were not admitted after transfer during the first month, and 8% during the two- month period. Only IV drug use was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of discharge without admission (odds ratio = 9.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.9 to 47.8). Conclusion(s): Patients transferred from the public hospital ED resulted in admission to the receiving hospital in 92% of transfers. A history of IV drug use was the only characteristic found to be associated with discharge without admission to the accepting hospital.

N2  - In October 1987, the New York State Department of Health initiated a study to determine the prevalence of antibody to HIV in clients of a facility for runaway and homeless adolescents in New York City. A risk-assessment component was added in May 1988. As of December 1989, a total of 2,667 adolescents had been tested, and 142 (5.3 percent) were found to be HIV-seropositive (males 6.0 percent, females 4.2 percent). The seroprevalence rate increased from 1.3 percent for 15-year-olds to 8.6 percent for 20-year-olds. Hispanics had the highest seroprevalence rate (6.8 percent), followed by non-Hispanic Whites (6.0 percent) and non-Hispanic Blacks (4.6 percent). HIV seropositivity was associated with intravenous drug use, male homosexual/bisexual activity, prostitution, and history of another sexually transmitted disease. The alarmingly high prevalence of HIV infection in this selected population illustrates the immediate need for prevention programs for adolescents.

Nurses can use research findings to educate other health professionals about homeless subcultures with attention to specific cultural and socioeconomic needs, as well as to develop interventions for homeless women. 2. Minority women are more susceptible to homelessness as they experience increased poverty levels and are often single mothers. Of all minority women, African-American women are the most vulnerable to physical and psychological illness. 3. In this study, 75% of the subjects had scores on a psychological assessment test that indicated they needed additional psychological testing.

N2  - Study objective-The aim was to test the assumption that mass miniature x ray screening of the single homeless (hostel residents) is a cost-effective means of controlling pulmonary tuberculosis. Design-The study was a prospective experimental screening exercise to identify new cases of active tuberculosis completing treatment. Setting-The setting was eight hostels in south London. A mobile x ray screening facility was set up outside the hostels. Subjects-Subjects were 547 single homeless residents in the hostels. They were encouraged to attend for chest x ray, and for active follow up of abnormal x rays. Main results-No new cases of active tuberculosis were found. Conclusions-Mass miniature x ray is ineffective in controlling tuberculosis because of its unacceptability and increasing inaccessibility to this population.

Y1  - 1992//
N2  - The differences in size of the four nutrient databases compared in this study were not associated with significant differences in mean calculated energy and nutrient values among the databases. Our study supports the recommendations of previous comparative studies by contributing information that may help define what constitutes an acceptable or reasonable degree of between-system variation. This level of variation can be set at 10%. Nutrient database developers strive for a 5% level of variation for nutrients that are complete in the USDA NDB SR and have reliable and accurate analytical methodologies. More research is recommended to develop a model for the standardization and evaluation of nutrient database systems, so that interdatabase reliability will continue to improve. Most comparative studies of nutrient databases are descriptive in nature (11). The development of benchmark tests, similar to those used for business software, is necessary to have a systematic way of testing and comparing the hundreds of dietary analysis programs that are currently available. The database programs considered in this study compared favorably with the standard reference database (USDA NDB SR), which indicates that each of the four programs is suitable for analyzing dietary records for this particular study population. Further comparative studies are needed with different populations before generalized conclusions can be made.

N2  - In 1989 through 1990, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1437 homeless adults in northern California (98% response rate). Prevalences of alcohol abuse, illegal drug use, and psychiatric hospitalization when adults first became homeless were 15% to 33% lower than prevalences following homelessness. The largest differences between the homeless and a comparison group of 3122 nonhomeless adults were for psychiatric hospitalization (odds ratios [ORs] of 4.6 for men and 5.9 for women) and alcohol abuse (ORs of 2.3 for men and 4.0 for women). However, when prehomeless prevalences of addictive and psychiatric disorders were compared with prevalences among the nonhomeless, absolute differences were no greater than 12%.

Y1  - 1991//
N2  - Problems related to homeless/runaway youths have received increased attention in recent years. Homeless/runaway youths manifest many problems in addition to being absent from home and without supervision of a parent or guardian. The purpose of the study was to determine drug use and abuse patterns of homeless/runaway youths and to compare those patterns, along with attitudes toward selected illicit behaviors, with similar data collected from adolescents in school. Data were collected from persons (n = 253) in homeless/runaway shelters in the southeast United States. Comparisons made with data from other studies of runaways and of youths in school indicate that drug use and abuse is two-three times more prevalent for runaways than with the school youths. Runaways' attitudes toward selected illicit behaviors are more tolerant than those of school youths. Intervention programs for runaway/homeless youths should reflect an understanding of the complexity of the psycho-social and behavioral history of the clients which is much different than that of those who are in school.

T1  - Runaway and street youth at risk for HIV infection: Legal and ethical issues in access to care
A1  - English A. 
Y1  - 1991//
N2  - Significant numbers of runaway and street youth are at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. These youth are physically, socially, and psychologically vulnerable and need access to health care and related services. Legal and ethical concerns of consent and confidentiality may limit their access, although in many states the law allows some minors to consent to HIV testing and treatment and protects confidentiality of HIV-related information. Appropriate pretest and posttest counseling and follow-up for youth at risk of infection are essential. Limited access to HIV treatment for youth testing positive raises serious ethical concerns. Access to comprehensive treatment is currently limited by lack of adequate financing, despite a patchwork of numerous public funding sources providing some coverage for treatment of HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Research studies and clinical trials are critical elements in the planning and delivery of HIV-related services to adolescents, but require consideration of special ethical and legal concerns.

N2  - Prostitution-involved adolescents self assigned into one of three groups: school attenders (of alternative street school), unable to attend, and school refusers. Data were collected at intake and 50 days after intake for the following measures: Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale, Rosenberg Self- Esteem Scale, Quality of School Life Scale, and self-reported weekly prostitution events. School attenders improved significantly on all measures, showing less depression, improved school sentiment, improved self-esteem, and reduced prostitution activity after less than 2 months of street school. Except for self-esteem, no significant changes on these dependent variables were observed for either of the other school groups.

T1  - Evaluation of threshold: An independent living program for homeless adolescents
A1  - Schram D.D.

Y1  - 1991//
N2  - The Threshold Project, a residential treatment program, was designed to work with homeless and alienated young women who were approaching 18 years of age but lacked the skills, values, and attitudes necessary to care for themselves and assume the responsibilities of adulthood. Project services were designed to prepare these young women for independent living and to break the inter-generational cycle of abuse and neglect experienced by this population. Threshold offered a series of progressively more independent living experiences to young homeless women ages 16-18 years, who had been sexually/physically/emotionally abused or neglected, and who had been involved in or at high risk for prostitution. A majority of the clients responded well to the requirements of the program, including the expectation that they maintain employment and participate in educational programs during the semi-independent living phase of the project. A follow-up assessment undertaken after clients left the project found that 42% of the young women met all 'success' criteria, that is, they lived independently (or in stable situations), attended school and/or were employed, had not engaged in prostitution or other offense behavior, and did not abuse alcohol or other substances.

N2  - All initial visits (n = 620) of runaway/homeless youths to an outpatient medical clinic over a 12-month period (July 1988-June 1989) were analyzed. Of these visits, 467 made by youth not involved in prostitution were compared with 153 visits by youth who were involved. According to the data from an adolescent risk profile interview, homeless youth involved in prostitution are at greater risk for a wide variety of medical problems and health- compromising behaviors, including drug abuse, suicide, and depression. The implications for public health and social policy are discussed.

T1  - Street youth: Adaptation and survival in the AIDS decade
A1  - Luna G.C. 
Y1  - 1991//
N2  - This article discusses adaptational and survival strategies of homeless youth and describes how pilot research, begun in 1982 on these strategies in the western United States, led to additional research and activity focused upon the related international street youth problem. The results of this research suggest that a critical relationship exists between survival strategies and the AIDS pandemic. The impact of this pandemic on street youth can be mitigated only by immediate and comprehensive preventive actions at both national and international levels.

N2  - Homeless 3-12-year-old children residing in city shelters were compared with a matched control group of 45 inner city children in terms of cognitive functioning and emotional-behavioral adjustment. School-age children in both groups did not differ significantly on most measures. Preschool homeless children exhibited slower development and more emotional-behavioral problems than did their domiciled peers, and significantly fewer were enrolled in early childhood programs. The feasibility of evaluating this population on standardized instruments is demonstrated, and implications of the study for social policy are discussed.

Y1  - 1991//
N2  - Objective. - Reductions in runaways' sexual risk behaviors were evaluated in response to an intensive program to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Design. - In a nonrandomized control trial, sexual risk behaviors among 78 runaways at one residential shelter who received up to 30 HIV/AIDS intervention sessions were compared with 67 runaways at a nonintervention shelter with sexual behaviors assessed at baseline and 3 and 6 months. Setting. - Runaways were recruited from the only two publicly funded shelters in New York, NY. Participants. - The runaways were aged 11 to 18 years, 64% female, and predominantly black or Hispanic. Intervention. - The intervention addressed general knowledge about HIV/AIDS, coping skills, access to health care and other resources, and individual barriers to safer sex. Main Outcome Measures. - Consistent condom use, a high-risk pattern of sexual behavior, and sexual abstinence over a 3-month time frame were assessed. Main Results. - As the number of intervention sessions increased, runaways' reports of consistent condom use increased significantly (at 3 months, unique R2 = .06, P<.05; at 6 months, unique R2 = .09, P<.05), and their reports of engaging in a high-risk pattern of sexual behavior decreased significantly (at 3 months, unique R2 = .03, P = .06; at 6 months, unique R2 = .04, P<.05). Abstinence did not change. Conclusions. - The demonstrated effectiveness of the intensive HIV/AIDS program highlights the importance of enlarging the scope of most current HIV/AIDS prevention programs.

N2  - The main purpose of this article is to evaluate the incidence of alcoholism in three different groups from the poor segments of the population. Two types of questionnaires--CAGE and SADD--were applied to 334 men. Incidence of alcoholism in each group was: group I--134 homeless men, without a regular job, sheltered in a public institution, 55.9%; group II--106 unskilled male workers, working in construction sites, 43.4%; group III--94 unskilled male workers, working for a public institution, 23.4%. Results show a very high incidence of alcoholism in these segments of the Brazilian population.

T1  - Psychosocial characteristics of homeless children and children with homes

Y1  - 1990//
N2  - A comparison was made of 86 children from 49 homeless Boston families headed by women and 134 children from 81 housed Boston families headed by women. In both groups, the mothers were poor, currently single, and had been receiving welfare payments for long periods. Data were collected from the mothers by personal interview; standardized tests were administered to mothers and children (Denver Developmental Screening Test, Simmons Behavior Checklist, Children's Depression Inventory, Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Child Behavior Checklist. The data indicate that many homeless children and poor children with homes have severe and pressing problems. Among preschool children, a higher proportion of homeless children than poor children with homes had one or more developmental delays (P < .05), although their scores on the Simmons Behavior Checklist were similar. Among school-aged children, the scores of the homeless children were worse than those of the children with homes on the Children's Depression Inventory, Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, and the Child Behavior Checklist, but only the difference on the Anxiety Scale approached statistical significance (P = .06). Both homeless children and poor children with homes generally had worse scores than most other comparison groups of children. Unless action is taken to improve the lot of all these children, it is likely that many will continue to have significant problems that will seriously hamper their ability to function.

Y1  - 1988//
N2  - The purpose of this study was to determine if there are significant differences between first-time and recidivist runaway residents of a county center for juvenile status offenders. A total of 149 subjects (34 males and 115 females) between the ages of 12 and 16 were administered the Reading section of the High School Personality Questionnaire. Demography data were obtained from each subject's intake interview form. A stepwise multiple discrimination analysis resulted in the selection of 8 variables that discriminate between first-time and recidivist runaways. The 8 discriminant variables characterized the recidivist runaway as an urban, Caucasian youth who has had previous contact with an agency, has stayed at the center an average of 13.6 days, has lower general intelligence, is less objective and less self-sufficient, and is at risk of becoming psychotic or delinquent.

N2  - We reviewed the outpatient medical records of 265 homeless children less than 5 years of age in New York City and compared them with children of similar low socioeconomic status (SES) attending the same pediatric clinic. The frequency of health problems among the homeless children, including delayed immunizations, elevated blood lead levels, the rate of admission to hospital, and the rate of child abuse and neglect reports, exceeded those for the comparison groups.

T1  - Sexual abuse: Somatic and emotional reactions

Y1  - 1988//
N2  - A chart review and telephone interview of 72 sexual abuse victims was conducted to determine if children and adolescents who are victims of sexual abuse suffer from symptoms similar to the 'rape trauma syndrome', which has been reported in adults. Symptoms similar to the rape trauma syndrome were found in 48 of the 72 abused children and only 26 of the matched control group, p<.01. Common somatic complaints in the sexual abuse patients included dysuria, vaginal discharge and chronic abdominal pain. Some of the emotional and behavioral problems noted during the follow-up period among the sexual abuse patients included sleep problems, runaway behavior, and suicide attempts. The duration of abuse and age of the victim at the time of abuse significantly affected the frequency of reported somatic symptoms, but the type of abuse and type of assailant did not significantly affect the frequency of reported somatic and emotional reactions. There was no difference in the occurrence of school problems and early pregnancy between sexually abused patients and controls. Since 67% of all sexually abused patients suffered from emotional and somatic reactions, close follow-up of these patients is indicated.

N2  - Juvenile crime is a serious problem for which treatment approach has been found to be reliably effective. This outcome evaluation assessed during and posttreatment effectiveness of Teaching-Family group home treatment programs for juvenile offenders. The evaluation included the original Achievement Place program, which was the prototype for the development of the Teaching-Family treatment approach, 12 replications of Achievement Place, and 9 comparison group home programs. Primary dependent measures were retrieved from court and police files and included number of alleged offenses, percentage of youths involved in those alleged offenses, and percentage of youths institutionalized. Other dependent measures were subjective ratings of effectiveness obtained from the program consumers, including the group home residents. The results showed difference during treatment favoring the Teaching-Family programs on rate of alleged criminal offenses, percentage of youths involved in those offenses, and consumer ratings of the programs. The consumer ratings provided by the youths and their school teachers were found to be inversely and significantly correlated with the reduction of criminal offenses during treatment. There were no significant differences during treatment on measures of noncriminal offenses (e.g., truancy, runaway, and curfew violations). In the posttreatment year, none of the differences between the groups was significant on any of the outcome measures. The results are discussed in terms of measurement and design issues in the evaluation of delinquency treatment programs and in relation to the evaluation; of Teaching-Family group homes by Richard Jones and his colleagues.

T1  - Psychotherapy of disadvantaged acting out adolescents
A1  - Chwast J. 
Y1  - 1977//
N2  - Acting out among disadvantaged adolescents derives from both psychologic and social causes. Treatment must therefore take them both into account. This paper considers the acting-out adolescent who is an offender and the youngster who is a runaway or throwaway. Parameters of acting out are form, locus, direction and duration. The causes are complex and derive from broad social, economic, and political forces as well as specific factors within the individual such as biological stress, crises, the malevolent transformation, anxiety, guilt and masked depression, and inadequate controls. Treatment aims at achieving effective inner controls. The therapist must set realistic goals, work flexibly, build awareness and insight with considerable caution, enhance ability to tolerate anxiety and guilt, avoid being manipulated, reinforce desirable change, and fully utilize other resources. Agency treatment is probably more feasible than private psychotherapy. Experience at Contact confirms that with support acting-out adolescents can accept controls over behavior which facilitate further therapeutic uncovering.

T1  - Medical care of homeless and rootless young people
A1  - Holden H.M. 
Y1  - 1975//
N2  - Most social institutions including the health service are geared towards a geographically stable population living in flats or houses. Nomads are deviant and therefore unpopular both with the general public and the institutions which serve them. The homeless tend to be regarded with suspicion and often disgust and, since they have no homes, they are unable to register with a general practitioner. Although they are frequently seen in hospital casualty departments they are unpopular there also and usually got rid of as soon as possible. This paper is a short account of the author's experience as a physician to an experimental scheme providing accommodation for homeless and rootless young people in North London.
