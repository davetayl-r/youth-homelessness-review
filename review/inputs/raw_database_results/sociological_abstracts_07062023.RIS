AB  - Objective: To examine family risk factors associated with dissociative symptoms among homeless & runaway youth. Method: Three hundred & twenty-eight homeless & runaway youth were interviewed using a systematic sampling strategy in metropolitan Seattle. Homeless young people were interviewed on the streets & in shelters by outreach workers in youth service agencies. Results: The current study revealed widespread prevalence of dissociative symptoms among these young people. Multivariate analyses revealed that sexual abuse, physical abuse, & family mental health problems were all positively associated with dissociative symptoms. No gender differences were found for any of the models. Conclusions: Dissociative behavior is widespread among these youth & may pose a serious mental health concern. Some young people experience numerous stressors, & with few resources & little support available, many may invoke maladaptive strategies such as dissociative behavior to handle such situations, which may in turn be detrimental to their mental health. Unless youth are provided with programs & intervention, the cycle of abuse that they have experienced at home is likely to continue on the street. 3 Tables, 1 Appendix, 39 References.

AB  - In this study, I compared the shifts in attitude of affluent high school seniors participating in a course on social justice issues to a control group of similar adolescents. In this course, participating adolescents learned about social justice issues such as homelessness, poverty, world hunger, and illegal immigration. An analysis of presurvey and postsurvey data revealed that the adolescents participating in the social justice course experienced a decline over the course of the semester in their support for educational equity between wealthy and poor communities. Interviews with these adolescents and analyses of their student work revealed that their shifts in attitude were influenced by fears about the possibility of one day becoming poor or homeless themselves.

AB  - Background: The experience of homelessness and child protection involvement pose risks to children's school success. Elucidating processes by which these interrelated systems affect child well-being is important for guiding policy and practice. Objective: This study examines the temporal relation between emergency shelter or transitional housing use and child protection involvement among school-aged children. We evaluated effects of both risk indicators on school attendance and school mobility. Participant and setting: Using integrated administrative data, we identified 3278 children (ages 4 to 15) whose families used emergency or transitional housing in Hennepin and Ramsey County of Minnesota during the 2014 and 2015 academic years. A propensity-score-matched comparison group of 2613 children who did not use emergency or transitional housing. Method: Through a series of logistic regressions and generalized estimating equations, we tested the temporal associations of emergency/transitional housing and child protection involvement as well as how both experiences affected school attendance and mobility. Results: Experiences of emergency or transitional housing often proceeded or occurred concurrently with child protection involvement and increased the likelihood of child protection services. Emergency or transitional housing and child protection involvement posed risks for lower school attendance and greater school mobility. Conclusions: A multisystem approach to assist families across social services may be important for stabilizing children's housing and bolstering their success at school. A two-generation approach focused on residential and school stability and enhancing family resources could boost adaptive success of family members across contexts.

AB  - Runaway is a status offense for which there is concern that youths, particularly girls, are vulnerable to the "evils of the streets." Prior research suggests that many personal and family risks of runaway are gendered, that the streets may be meaner, and that the strategies for survival disproportionately serve to criminalize girls. Moreover, patriarchial values may make the juvenile justice response to runaway girls overly harsh "for their own good." Unfortunately, research has been hampered by small or biased samples. This study examines many risk factors to discern patterns and gender differences among runaway youths for whom there is a status offense charged. Many charged runaway youths are followed to determine the nature of official responses and whether responses appear gendered. The findings have implications for changes in how officials respond to runaway youths, both in terms of what will better serve the youths' best interests and for improving public safety.

AB  - Objective To examine racial discrimination and its relation to violence involvement among a sample of urban African American men. Methods Participants of this cross-sectional study were African American men (N = 703) between the ages of 18 and 65 years, recruited from four urban community health centers and two hospital-based clinics within an urban center in the Northeast. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the relation of reported racial discrimination to recent perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV), street violence involvement, and gang involvement. Racial discrimination was measured via 7 items assessing everyday and lifetime experiences of racial discrimination. Results In logistic regression models adjusted for age and homelessness, men reporting high levels of discrimination (scores above the sample median) were significantly more likely to report IPV perpetration (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.9; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.2-2.9) and street violence involvement (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.2) as compared to men reporting lower levels of discrimination. No relation was found between experiencing discrimination and gang involvement. Conclusions Findings showcase the potential relevance of racial discrimination to efforts focused on reducing racial disparities related to violence.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This paper explores the lives of formerly homeless young people as they transitioned towards housing stability. The study employed a longitudinal design involving 51 street youth in Halifax, NS and Toronto, ON. This paper sheds light upon the pathways through young people transitioned a way from homelessness using the developmental lens of emerging adulthood: a stage involving numerous developmental struggles (identity, instability, self focus, feeling in-between) but also an age filled with hope and possibilities. There are numerous interrelated factors at play that allow participants to regain a sense of citizenship with mainstream society. While housing in itself did not shape these young people's sense of stability, it influenced feelings of health, happiness and security. Yet, our participants, as a particular segment of the youth population who have transitioned out of basic homelessness, continue to describe their current lives in terms of fragility and instability. For most, opportunity for experimentation and identity exploration was often curtailed by processes outside of their control and struggles with the consequences of profound disempowerment -- past trauma with family and/or current struggles with public sector structures and services. As a result, many felt abandoned and stigmatized by the very resources whose mission it is to assist.

AB  - Homelessness among young people is partially explained in the framework of attachment theory. Here, the relationship between family background, parenting style, experiences of separation & loss, & quality of the attachment relationship is examined in the Netherlands using interview & questionnaire data from 108 homeless youths & two comparison groups, ie, 85 youth in residential institutions, & a control group of 1,228 youths from the general population. Data regarding the influence of social support were also obtained. Results indicate that growing up in a family with divorced parents, &/or with a lack of parental responsiveness & emotional support, is a significant factor in the genesis of homelessness. Social support systems can, however, act as a protective factor & thus prevent the development of homelessness. 5 Tables, 36 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Few studies have examined gender-specific factors associated with the nonuse of condoms among homeless & runaway youths (HRYs) -- a population at high risk for HIV infection. In this article, we evaluate these factors & explore gender differences in background experiences, psychosocial functioning, & risk behaviors among HRYs from four US metropolitan areas. Of 879 sexually active HRYs sampled, approximately 70% reported unprotected sexual intercourse during a 6-month period, & nearly 25% reported never using condoms in the same period. Among males & females, having only one sex partner in the previous 6 months had the strongest association with nonuse of condoms. Among males, nonuse was also associated with having ever caused pregnancy, frequent marijuana use, prior physical victimization, & low self-control & sociability. Among females, nonuse was associated with knowledge of HIV status, prior sexual victimization, low social support, & infrequent marijuana use. These findings highlight the ongoing need for HIV prevention services for HRYs. Implications for the scope & content of these services are discussed. 5 Tables, 50 References.

AB  - Homeless youth frequently experience victimization, and youth with histories of trauma often fail to detect danger risks, making them vulnerable to subsequent victimization. The current study describes a pilot test of a skills-based intervention designed to improve risk detection among homeless youth through focusing attention to internal, interpersonal, and environmental cues. Youth aged 18 to 21 years (N = 74) were recruited from a shelter and randomly assigned to receive usual case management services or usual services plus a 3-day manualized risk detection intervention. Pretest and posttest interviews assessed youths’ risk detection abilities through vignettes describing risky situations and asking youth to identify risk cues present. Separate 2 (intervention vs. control) × 2 (pretest vs. posttest) mixed ANOVAs found significant interaction effects, as intervention youth significantly improved in overall risk detection compared with control youth. Post hoc subgroup analyses found the intervention had a greater effect for youth without previous experiences of indirect victimization than those with previous indirect victimization experiences.

AB  - Although lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth with a history of homelessness (running away or being evicted from their homes by parents) report more psychological symptoms than homeless heterosexual peers, it is unclear whether symptoms are due to homelessness, given the absence of a non-homeless comparison group. This study longitudinally investigates whether LGB youth with a history of homelessness report more subsequent psychological symptoms than non-homeless LGB youth and examines potential mediators of any such relationships. Of the 156 LGB youth interviewed (49% female; 78% non-White), 48% reported past homeless experiences. Homelessness was associated with subsequent symptoms of anxiety, depression, conduct problems, and substance abuse and to changes in symptoms over time even after controlling for childhood sexual abuse and early development of sexual orientation. Stressful life events, negative social relationships, and social support from friends mediated the relationships between homelessness and symptomatology. These findings suggest the need for interventions to reduce stress and enhance social support among LGB youth with a history of homelessness in order to reduce psychological symptoms.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Issue Title: Special Focus: Communicable Disease Risk, Treatment, and PreventionForeign-born individuals comprise the majority of patients treated for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in the US. It is important to understand this population's tuberculosis-related knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs (KAB) as they may affect treatment acceptance and completion. KAB in 84 US-born and 167 foreign-born LTBI patients enrolled in a clinical trial assessing treatment completion at an urban public hospital were assessed at baseline. Demographic and substance use information was also collected. Results: Of 251 participants, 66.5% were foreign-born. While misconceptions existed among both US and foreign-born regarding transmission and contagiousness of LTBI, overall knowledge scores did not differ significantly between groups. With respect to attitudinal factors, foreign-born participants were less likely to acknowledge that they had LTBI and felt more "protected" from developing TB. Improved understanding of foreign-born patients' KAB may contribute to the reduction of barriers to treatment and improved outcomes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

Youths aged 13-23 were recruited from agency & street sites using a stratified probability sampling design. Interviewers administered a structured survey instrument lasting 20 minutes, which assessed youths' involvement in HIV risk-related sexual & drug-use behaviors, contact with outreach workers, & other variables. Significantly more Los Angeles youths (78%) reported testing than did San Diego youths (52%; p less than .001). Multivariable analyses controlling for risk behaviors, knowing someone with HIV, & contact with outreach workers indicated that the higher rates of these factors in Los Angeles did not account for the difference in testing rates between the cities. Youths in Los Angeles were still 1.85 times as likely to be tested as San Diego youths (p less than .001), possibly a result of differing normative behavior & accessibility of testing services. 3 Tables, 1 Figure, 22 References.

AB  - Juvenile delinquency's individual, familial, community, and educational risk factors, as well as promising interventions continue to be researched, with promising outcomes. Furthermore, perceived parenting efficacy research has shown that it can be beneficial to families with disabilities. This pre-experimental archival research project examined the efficacy of The Adolescent Transition Program's parent management curriculum (PMC) on risk factors associated with juvenile delinquency, with mothers residing in a long-term homeless shelter with their children. The records of nine parents who completed the PMC were examined to determine perceived impact. There was no control group. Both the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory and the Stress Index for Parents of Adolescents were used, as pre and post measures, to assess outcomes. This research project analyzed the archival data to examine the PMC's impact on parent-child conflict child problem behaviors, and perceived parenting efficacy, as risk factors for delinquency. Paired-sample t tests examined and demonstrated significant differences on both the ECBI and the SIPA between pre and post measures. The findings of this research project support the hypotheses that participation in the parent management curriculum would decrease reported conflict between the parent and child; and participation in the parent management curriculum would increase parent's perceived parenting efficacy, resulting in improved Adolescent-Parent relationships. The findings suggest that this curriculum can be used not only as a preventative tool, but also as an intervention to impact risk factors for delinquency. However, generalizability is limited, due to the small sample size and other limitations of this research project.

AB  - Examines the interrelationship among childhood victimization, running away, & delinquency, & whether running away serves to mediate or moderate this relationship. Data are from a prospective cohorts design study in which documented cases of childhood abuse & neglect drawn from the court records of a metropolitan area in the midwestern US were compared to matched controls & followed-up & interviewed as adults, 1989-1995. Results indicate that (1) being abused or neglected in childhood increases the likelihood that a youth will run away from home, (2) both childhood victimization & running away increase the risk of juvenile arrest, & (3) chronic runaways are at greater risk of arrest as juveniles. Further, running away does not mediate the relationship between childhood victimization & delinquency because it increases the risk of juvenile arrest for both childhood victims & nonvictims. The effect of running away is stronger for nonabused & nonneglected youths than for abused & neglected children. Implications of these findings for research & policy are discussed. 5 Tables, 3 Figures, 40 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - National questionnaire & qualitative interview data from 208 young homeless people, ages 12-25, in Australia reveal a marked contrast between their mainly safe injecting practices & mainly unsafe sexual practices. Young people's stories of the culture & practices surrounding injecting were encouraging in the attention given to notions of responsibility & care for others, & a coherent discourse of belief in "safe" injecting practices was evident. A notion of the "druggie" or responsible drug user was contrasted with the "junkie" or irresponsible user in the culture of drug use. Conversely, reported sexual behaviors revealed neither consistent discourses about safe sex, nor an unambiguously expressed personal commitment to safe sex. Analysis of the differences between sex & drug use talk & the potential implications for intervention are considered. 19 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Homeless youth are adolescents and young adults who do not have stable dwellings but instead live on the streets, in shelters, or in other unstable situations. Although researchers have begun examining well‐being among this population, little is known about components of well‐being that are relevant to homeless youth or which factors predict differences in well‐being. This study examined psychological well‐being and its associations with demographic characteristics, intrapersonal factors (mental health, optimism, and self‐esteem), and social–contextual factors (social support, sense of community, and empowerment) among 100 youth experiencing homelessness. All of the intrapersonal and social–contextual variables were associated with well‐being at the bivariate level. In the full regression model, only self‐esteem and psychological distress remained significant. Findings inform future research and program development at homeless service centers.

AB  - This study investigated whether runaway behavior could be related to six problematic areas. Selected scales of the Personality Inventory for Children, representative of the six areas, were hypothesized to discriminate between an adolescent runaway group and a control group. Four scales correctly classified 95.1% of the runaway subjects and 100% of the control subjects with a total correct classification rate of 97.52%. It was further hypothesized that the runaway group was not significantly different from a known clinical group with moderate to severe psychopathology. Results indicated that the runaway group was not significantly different except on one scale, Delinquency (DLQ). On the DLQ scale the runaway group had a significantly higher mean score than the clinical group. Application and recommendations are presented.

It was hypothesized that street children with more social support would adapt better to life on the streets, & that street children with higher quality support would adapt better. Findings indicated that neither quantity nor quality of social support was related to adaptation. Implications with regard to the resiliency of street children are discussed. 20 References.

AB  -  In this study, I compared the shifts in attitude of affluent high school seniors participating in a course on social justice issues to a control group of similar adolescents. In this course, participating adolescents learned about social justice issues such as homelessness, poverty, world hunger, and illegal immigration. An analysis of presurvey and postsurvey data revealed that the adolescents participating in the social justice course experienced a decline over the course of the semester in their support for educational equity between wealthy and poor communities. Interviews with these adolescents and analyses of their student work revealed that their shifts in attitude were influenced by fears about the possibility of one day becoming poor or homeless themselves.

AB  -  Research to date has given little attention to differences in the experience of youth homelessness by ethnicity. This article provides a comparative descriptive analysis of the effect of differences and similarities in paths to homelessness, self-perception, and survival strategies on health behaviors and consequent health outcomes of African American and white homeless youth in San Francisco, USA. We conducted participant observation and ethnographic interviews with 54 youth primarily recruited from street venues. Hypotheses generated from the ethnographic data were validated in between-group analyses using concurrent epidemiological data collected from a sample of 205 youth. Our samples of unstably housed African American and white youth, though sharing common histories of family dysfunction, differed in both the ethnographic accounts and epidemiological analyses in their experiences of family, access to housing, street survival strategies, self-presentation, health behaviors and service utilization. Our sample of white youth generally identified with the term "homeless," engaged in survival activities associated with such a label, and accessed the services intended to address the needs of homeless youth. In contrast, our sample of African American youth generally did not perceive themselves as "homeless," a stigmatized term, and were thus less likely to utilize, or be accessed by, relevant services.

AB  - Little is known regarding the predictors of arrest for homeless and runaway youth. The self-reported criminal activity of homeless and runaway youth has been associated with familial abuse, deviant peers, and situational street stressors. The path to running away was suggested to differ by gender, with more girls running away from sexually and physically abusive homes than boys. We asked two questions in our research: Are the predictors of arrest among homeless and runaway youths similar to the predictors of self reported offending and do these predictors differ by gender? Our results indicated that association with deviant peers, prior arrest, sexual abuse, and poor parental monitoring were associated with the number of arrests homeless and runaway youths reported. Yet the effects of prior arrest and deviant peers were stronger for boys, suggesting a gendered process of arrest for homeless and runaway youth. 5 Tables, 3 Figures, 1 Appendix, 30 References.

AB  - Objective: Street children are vulnerable against HIV because of poverty, lack of family support, adult supervision, social exclusion, lack of access to health services and their special living environment. Required educational program could decrease the danger of transmission of HIV in this group. This study would investigate the effects of HIV prevention educational on street children's attitude and knowledge in the southeast of Iran. Methods: Totally, 60 street children were randomized into the intervention and control groups. Knowledge and attitude of the participants about HIV/AIDS were evaluated. Using two-day meeting, the intervention group received some information on the prevention, diagnosis, care and treatment and wrong and right believes of HIV/AIDS. The control group received nothing about the topic. Children settled in a childcare center by the end of the survey and after 30 days the knowledge and attitude of both groups were evaluated again. Results: The result of the study presented significant increase in street children's attitude and knowledge of intervention group compared to control group and before intervention. Follow-up data collected 1 month later revealed that the children who received the HIV/AIDS intervention subsequently had greater HIV/AIDS knowledge and favorable attitude toward HIV/AIDS. Conclusion: We showed by a two-day educational meeting, the knowledge and attitude of the street children could be improved. This improved knowledge and attitude could protect them against high-risk behaviors.

AB  - This review assessed the effectiveness of interventions for improving outcomes among street‐connected children and young people, and for reducing some important health‐related risks; and to improve access to and integration into society, education, and employment opportunities.Eligible study designs compare outcomes from interventions for street‐connected children and young people aimed at reintegration, education, employment, improving health and/or harm reduction, and provision of shelter, versus a comparison group (e.g. shelter/drop‐in service as usual). The review identified 13 studies evaluating 19 interventions. All studies were conducted in the USA except one (South Korea). The outcome for integration was not measured in included studies. The same was the case for education and employment related outcomes – none of the included studies measured literacy, numeracy, or participation in education or skills‐based employment. Several studies measured health‐related outcomes.Five studies investigate the effect of interventions to encourage safe or reduced sexual activity (e.g. numbers of partners, frequency of sex, HIV knowledge, unprotected sex, condom use and rates of abstinence). The results are mixed, lacking enough evidence to support any of the interventions.Eight studies report outcomes of interventions promoting safe or reduced substance use. The outcomes used a variety of measures in different studies at various times making it difficult to get a clear overview. The overall effect was mixed; some studies report positive effect and the others reported negative or no effect. Three studies investigate the effect of family therapy on substance abuse and report improvements in some of the measures.Eight studies investigate the effect of therapeutic interventions to improve mental health (including self‐esteem and depression) in street‐connected kids. In general, there is no significant improvement in the intervention group compared to the control group. In some instances, both groups improved from the baseline. Finally, two studies investigate the effect of family‐based approaches on family functioning. No differences were found between intervention and control conditions on most of the outcome measures used.BackgroundMillions of street‐connected children and young people worldwide live or work in street environments. They are vulnerable to many risks, whether or not they remain connected to families of origin, and despite many strengths and resiliencies, they are excluded from mainstream social structures and opportunities.ObjectivesPrimary research objectivesTo evaluate and summarise the effectiveness of interventions for street‐connected children and young people that aim to:• promote inclusion and reintegration;• increase literacy and numeracy;• facilitate access to education and employment;• promote mental health, including self esteem;• reduce harms associated with early sexual activity and substance misuse.Secondary research objectives• To explore whether effects of interventions differ within and between populations, and whether an equity gradient influences these effects, by extrapolating from all findings relevance for low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) (Peters 2004).• To describe other health, educational, psychosocial and behavioural effects, when appropriate outcomes are reported.• To explore the influence of context in design, delivery and outcomes of interventions.• To explore the relationship between numbers of components and duration and effects of interventions.• To highlight implications of these findings for further research and research methods to improve evidence in relation to the primary research objective.• To consider adverse or unintended outcomes.Search methodsWe searched the following bibliographic databases, searched for the original review, from inception to 2012, and various relevant non‐governmental and organisational websites: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE and Pre‐MEDLINE; EMBASE and EMBASE Classic; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); PsycINFO; Education Resource Information Center (ERIC); Sociological Abstracts; Social Services Abstracts; Social Work Abstracts; Healthstar; Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS); System for Grey literature in Europe (OpenGrey); ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; EconLit; IDEAS Economics and Finance Research; JOLIS Library Catalog of the holdings of the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Libraries; British Library for Development Studies (BLDS); Google and Google Scholar. We updated the search in April 2015 for the review update, using the same methods.Selection criteriaThis review includes data from harm reduction or reintegration intervention studies that used a comparison group study design; all were randomised or quasi‐randomised studies. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions provided for street‐connected children and young people, from birth to 24 years, in all contexts.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias and other factors presented in the Discussion and Summary quality assessment (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)). We extracted data on intervention delivery, context, process factors, equity and outcomes, and grouped outcomes into psychosocial outcomes, risky sexual behaviours or substance use. We conducted meta‐analyses for outcomes where the outcome measures were sufficiently similar. We evaluated other outcomes narratively.Main resultsWe included 13 studies evaluating 19 interventions from high‐income countries (HICs). At update stage (from our 2015 search), one previously included study was removed and three new studies added (since our 2012 search). We found no sufficiently robust evaluations conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). Study quality overall was low and measurements used by studies variable. Participants were classified as drop‐in and shelter‐based. No studies measured the primary outcome of reintegration and none reported on adverse effects. We found no consistent results on a range of relevant outcomes within domains of psychosocial health, substance misuse and sexually risky behaviours . Interventions evaluated consisted of time‐limited therapeutically based programmes that proved no more effective than standard shelter or drop‐in services and other control interventions used for most outcomes in most studies. Favourable changes from baseline were reported for outcomes for most participants following therapy interventions and standard services. We noted considerable heterogeneity between studies and inconsistent reporting of equity data. No studies measured the primary outcome of reintegration or reported on adverse effects.Authors' conclusionsAnalysis revealed no consistently significant benefit for focused therapeutic interventions compared with standard services such as drop‐in centres, case management and other comparable interventions for street‐connected children and young people. Commonly available services, however, were not rigorously evaluated. Robust evaluation of interventions, including comparison with no intervention, would establish a more reliable evidence base to inform service implementation. More robust research is needed in LMICs to examine interventions for street‐connected children and young people with different backgrounds and service needs.

AB  - This paper looks at a group of young people who are generally viewed as excluded on a number of levels -- young lesbian, gay, & bisexual homeless people. Given that young homeless lesbian, gay, & bisexual people have often been described to us as experiencing multiple disadvantages, we would like to address this premise more carefully. We draw on their stories via interview to describe the general situation of our homeless sample & how (leaving their sexuality out of the account) they can be seen to share many factors in common with mainstream homeless young people. Putting their sexuality back into the picture we suggest that, although over time it has played a significant role in their homelessness crisis, it may also enable new forms of inclusion. We conclude by challenging taken-for-granted assumptions about necessary & unilinear assumptions about sexuality & disadvantage. Attending to the voices of our sample, we ask whether in the negotiation of difference, the difference that difference makes may also convey certain degrees of agency & empowerment even in these most extreme circumstances. 40 References.

Whether or not they remain connected to their families of origin, and despite many strengths and resiliencies, they are vulnerable to a range of risks and are excluded from mainstream social structures and opportunities.OBJECTIVESTo summarise the effectiveness of interventions for street‐connected children and young people that promote inclusion and reintegration and reduce harms. To explore the processes of successful intervention and models of change in this area, and to understand how intervention effectiveness may vary in different contexts.SEARCH STRATEGYWe searched the following bibliographic databases, from inception to 2012, and various relevant non‐governmental and organisational websites: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE and PreMEDLINE; EMBASE and EMBASE Classic; CINAHL; PsycINFO; ERIC; Sociological Abstracts; Social Services Abstracts; Social Work Abstracts; Healthstar; LILACS; System for Grey literature in Europe (OpenGrey); ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; EconLit; IDEAS Economics and Finance Research; JOLIS Library Catalog of the holdings of the World Bank Group and IMF Libraries; BLDS (British Library for Development Studies); Google, Google Scholar.SELECTION CRITERIAThe review included data from harm reduction or reintegration promotion intervention studies that used a comparison group study design and were all randomised or quasi‐randomised studies. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions aimed to benefit street‐connected children and young people, aged 0 to 24 years, in all contexts.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSISTwo review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were extracted on intervention delivery, context, process factors, equity and outcomes. Outcome measures were grouped according to whether they measured psychosocial outcomes, risky sexual behaviours or substance use. A meta‐analysis was conducted for some outcomes though it was not possible for all due to differences in measurements between studies. Other outcomes were evaluated narratively.RESULTSWe included 11 studies evaluating 12 interventions from high income countries. We did not find any sufficiently robust evaluations conducted in low and middle income countries (LMICs) despite the existence of many relevant programmes. Study quality overall was low to moderate and there was great variation in the measurement used by studies, making comparison difficult. Participants were drop‐in and shelter based. We found no consistent results on a range of relevant outcomes within domains of psychosocial health, substance misuse and sexual risky behaviours despite the many measurements collected in the studies. The interventions being evaluated consisted of time limited therapeutically based programmes which did not prove more effective than standard shelter or drop‐in services for most outcomes and in most studies. There were favourable changes from baseline in outcomes for most participants in therapy interventions and also in standard services. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies and equity data were inconsistently reported. No study measured the primary outcome of reintegration or reported on adverse effects. The review discussion section included consideration of the relevance of the findings for LMIC settings.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONSAnalysis across the included studies found no consistently significant benefit for the ‘new’ interventions compared to standard services for street‐connected children and young people. These latter interventions, however, have not been rigorously evaluated, especially in the context of LMICs. Robustly evaluating the interventions would enable better recommendations to be made for service delivery. There is a need for future research in LMICs that includes children who are on the streets due to urbanisation, war or migration and who may be vulnerable to risks such as trafficking.1 Plain Language SummaryThere are millions of children and young people estimated to be living and working on the streets around the world. Many have become resilient but continue to be vulnerable to risks. To promote their best chances in life, services are needed to reduce risks and prevent marginalisation from mainstream society. Eleven studies evaluating 12 interventions have been rigorously conducted of services to support street‐connected children and youth, all in the developed world. They compared therapy‐based services with usual shelter and drop‐in services. The results of these studies were mixed but overall we found that participants receiving therapy or usual services benefitted to a similar level. There is a need for research which considers the benefit of usual drop‐in and shelter services, most particularly in low and middle income countries, and which includes participation of street‐connected children and young people. None of the studies included participants that were comparable to some street children in low income countries, who may be on the street primarily to earn a living or as a result of war, migration or urbanisation.

AB  - Researchers of homelessness have been careful to delineate the heterogeneity of adolescent homelessness and street involvement when defining and differentiating street life experiences around the globe. Understanding these experiences poses challenges to researchers as adolescents across these locations come to the street at various stages of transition and homelessness yet share similarities. In this article, we review homeless research to understand both the heterogeneous characteristics and experiences adolescents have when they become involved in street life and homelessness around the world, as well as the similarities and differences they globally share. We review and compare general definitions of street life and homelessness presented in observations of young people on the street in the developed and developing worlds. We then explore interrelated characteristics outlined by researchers across these studies and locations, namely, the homeless status of street life participants and their socialization to street life as well as their network affiliations. Although this collected body of work reveals a complex heterogeneity of street involvement among all those that participate, it also shows how the young and street involved around the globe share these commonalities with one another which challenges the frameworks and classifications that guide contemporary global research among the homeless.

AB  - Food security is an important social determinant of health. The 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 2.2 reported high prevalence of food insecurity among low income households and those formed by recent immigrants. Exploration of the extent and correlates of food insecurity among recent Latin Americans (LA) immigrants is essential considering they encompasses an increasing number of young immigrants, many of whom, despite relatively high education, are unemployed or have low wage positions. This study examines the extent of food insecurity and its correlates among recent Latin American (LA) immigrants in Toronto. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a convenience sample of 70 adult LA recent immigrants. Participants were recruited from selected community health centres across Toronto using snow ball sampling. Data were collected using questionnaires in face-to-face interviews with primary household care givers. A considerably high rate of food insecurity (56%) was found among participants. Household food insecurity was highly related to: being on social assistance; limited proficiency in English; and the use of foodbanks. Our findings indicate that the primary correlate of a household's food security status is income, which suggests the potential for strategies to improve the financial power of new immigrants to purchase sufficient, nutritious, and culturally acceptable food.

AB  - Hecht and Coyle compare characteristics of older homeless adults with younger homeless adults and examine gender differences within each age group. The data suggest that pathways to homelessness among older women may be more crisis driven than those of men, whereas older men are more vulnerable to being chronically homeless than are older women.

AB  - This study investigates the relative impact of trauma experiences that occurred prior to and since becoming homeless on depressive symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and self-injurious behaviors among a sample of homeless youth (N = 389). Youth (aged 13 to 25) who had been homeless or precariously housed in the past year completed a survey about housing history, experiences of violence and victimization, mental health, and service utilization. In addition to examining the impact associated with specific trauma types, we also considered the effect of "early-on" poly-victimization (i.e., cumulative number of reported traumas prior to homelessness) and the influence of a compound sexual trauma variable created to represent earlier complex trauma. This created-variable has values ranging from no reported trauma, single trauma, multiple non-sexual traumas, and multiple traumas that co-occurred with sexual abuse. Multivariate analyses revealed that specific traumatic experiences prior to homelessness, including sexual abuse, emotional abuse/neglect, and adverse home environment, predicted greater mental health symptoms. Poly-victimization did not add to the prediction of mental health symptoms after the inclusion of specific traumas. Results with early compound sexual trauma revealed significant differences between lower-order trauma exposures and multiple-trauma exposures. Specifically, experience of multiple traumas that co-occurred with sexual trauma was significantly more detrimental in predicting PTSD symptoms than multiple traumas of non-sexual nature. Findings support the utility of an alternate/novel conceptualization of complex trauma, and support the need to carefully evaluate complex traumatic experiences that occurred prior to homelessness, which can impact the design and implementation of mental health care and services for homeless youth.

There were no differences between two of the groups in relation to their attitudes towards marijuana, & no differences in perceived access to the drug. For those who intended using marijuana, personal beliefs were significantly more salient than beliefs about what important others thought they should do. 4 Tables, 18 References.

AB  -  In his control balance theory Charles Tittle maintained that under favorable conditions unbalanced control ratios will lead to different forms of deviance. The type of deviance chosen is argued to depend on the degree of the control imbalance and the desirability the offense presents as a method of altering the imbalance. Utilizing a sample of homeless street youth this study examined if different types of control balance ratios were associated with hard and soft drug use. The findings revealed that control balance surpluses and control balance deficits were both related to hard and soft drug use but that these relationships were significantly stronger for hard drug use. Further, provocation and self-control were significant predictors of hard but not soft drug use while drug using peers predicted soft drug use but not hard drug use. Parental drug use, perceptions of risk, and values supportive of illegal behavior predicted both forms of drug use. Results are discussed and directions for further research and theoretical refinement are offered. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Travelers are a migratory subgroup of homeless youth who may be especially prone to engaging in risky behavior. This study compared the substance use and sexual behavior of young homeless travelers and non-travelers to evaluate the extent and possible sources of travelers' increased risk. Data came from face-to-face interviews with 419 homeless youth (36.6% female, 34.0% white, 23.9% African American, and 20.0% Hispanic) between the ages of 13 and 24 years (M = 20.1 years, SD = 2.5) who were randomly sampled from 41 shelters, drop-in centers, and street sites in Los Angeles. Travelers were almost twice as likely as non-travelers to exhibit recent heavy drinking, 37% more likely to exhibit recent marijuana use, and five times as likely to have injected drugs. Travelers also had more recent sex partners and were more likely to report having casual or need-based sexual partners and combining sex with substance use. Mediation analyses suggest that travelers' deviant peer associations and disconnection to conventional individuals and institutions may drive their elevated substance use. Differences in sexual risk behaviors are likely attributable to demographic differences between the two groups. Overall, these differences between travelers and non-travelers suggest different service needs and the need for different service approaches.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - There are two factors that limit our knowledge of the risk factors associated with homelessness among runaway adolescents, namely (1) the samples used are often composed of youth homeless service users and/or youths living on the streets (visible homelessness), whereas most adolescents in fact use private resources (hidden homelessness), and (2) failure to use an adequate control group to identify risk factors associated specifically with homelessness. Our study compares the characteristics of two groups of youths under the supervision of the youth protection system, according to the presence or absence of periods of homelessness. The results throw light on the factors underlying the shift from at risk to homeless, showing that youths with experience of homelessness are more likely to have been placed in substitute home environments, have experienced significant relationship difficulties with one of their parents (deterioration of the parent/youth relationship and parental abuse) and to have been diagnosed with behavioural disorders. The findings suggest that the decision to place young people under supervision is based more on the dynamic between risk factors rather than on the existence of behavioural problems.

AB  - Purpose: Trading sexual activities for money, dugs, food, shelter, protection or basic needs (also defined as sexual exploitation among adolescents under age 18) can have significant health consequences, and ranges widely among youth sub-groups, from around 1% in school populations to over 40% among homeless youth. Most research has focused on adolescent girls, with some about boys, but limited research includes transgender youth. Transgender youth appear to be more likely to be victims of violence and sexual abuse than their peers, two commonly identified risks for trading sex. This study aimed to identify predictors of trading sex or sexual exploitation among transgender youth in Canada. Methods: Data were drawn from the 2014 Canadian Trans Youth Health Survey, a national on-line survey of youth age 14 to 25, from those who responded to questions about ever trading sex (N=656). Of those, 276 (42.5%) identified as transmasculine, 107 (16.5%) as transfeminine, and 266 (41%) as non-binary; mean age M=20.68, SD=2.88; 45.5% identified as ethnic minority or mixed ethnicity. We identified predictor variables using bivariate logistic regressions, and odds ratios as indicators of effect size. Results: A tenth of participants (66, 10.1%) reported having traded sex (22.7% were under 18). Of those who had traded sex, 32.8% were assigned male at birth, and 67.2% were assigned female; 37.9% identified as transmasculine, 22.7% as transfeminine, and 39.4% as non-binary. Youth who had been sexually abused were 20 times more likely to trade sex, and victims of sexual assault were over 7 times more likely. There was no difference among gender identities for trading sex. People who identified as a person of color or mixed ethnicity had higher odds of trading sex than those who identified as white (OR=2.7), and those of Aboriginal or Indigenous ethnicity higher odds (OR=4.1) than their peers. Participants were over 4 times more likely to trade sex if they had run away from home, or obtained trans-related hormones from illicit sources. Those who used injected drugs had higher odds (OR=11.9) of trading sex, as well as those who used illicit drugs (OR=7.9). Conclusions: No gender differences were found, contradicting the general perception transwomen are at greater risk of exploitation or trading sex, however, visible ethnic minorities appeared more vulnerable, suggesting racism plays a role in exploitation. Sexual abuse as a major predictor emphasizes the need to identify and support victims early; health professionals should screen for sexual abuse among transgender adolescents. Additionally, odds of trading sex were much higher for runaway or homeless youth, those with food insecurity or illicit substance use, suggesting the importance of social safety nets for trans youth. Finally, results suggest the need to improve support and access to hormone treatments for trans youth, as those who cannot get them through health care may access them through illicit sources, and increase their odds of trading sex to afford them.

AB  - Purpose: To describe & explain variations in first mental health service utilization before & after running away from home for homeless adolescents. Methods: Survey interviews were conducted with homeless & runaway youth in several Midwestern locations. The effects of family of origin factors & street experiences on the likelihood of seeing a mental health professional for the first time before running away & after running away for the first time were examined. Bivariate & multivariate logistic regression methods are used to analyze these data. Interactions are tested across race & gender sub-groups. Results: Caretaker education, caretaker rejection, & family transitions increase the probability that an adolescent first sees a mental health professional before running away from home. Post-run intervention is more likely for females, younger runaways, shelter users, youths with social support networks, & youths abused by their caretakers. A gender gap in first service use exists for Whites but not for minority youth. Minority youth who experienced family abuse were less likely than abused Whites to report ever seeing a mental health professional. Conclusions: Analyses indicate homeless youth's utilization patterns are differentiated by family of origin factors, street experiences, timing of first utilization, & by race & gender interactions. Our findings suggest that youths whose first contact with mental health service use follows running away for the first time may experience higher levels of mental distress compared with other homeless runaways. The significant differences in first service use across race & gender subgroups should be further explored. The racial-ethnic gap in first mental health intervention for abused youths indicates this sub-group is not receiving services that are available to other homeless youths. Our findings suggest that homelessness does not homogenize racial/ethnic differences in first mental health service utilization. Tables, Figures, References.

AB  - Debates about social exclusion: how it is defined; who is excluded and why; the consequences of exclusion; and if and how policy might create a more inclusive society; have dominated British politics for at least the last two decades. This paper looks at a group of young people who are generally viewed as excluded on a number of levels - young lesbian, gay and bisexual homeless people. It begins by drawing of their stories to describe the general situation of the homeless sample and the ways in which they can be seen to share many factors in common with mainstream homeless young people. Putting their sexuality back into the picture, the paper suggests that, although over time it has played a significant role in their homelessness crises, it may also enable new forms of inclusion.

AB  - Youth experiencing homelessness are often portrayed as being amongst the most at-risk youth, due to increased risks of adverse outcomes. In turn, these youth have historically been pathologized and blamed for their status, and consequently, many experience stigma, isolation, and vulnerability. Although adverse outcomes are frequently experienced among this population, many possess notable strengths and demonstrate resilience and adaptive coping. Using a strength-based approach, the aim of this dissertation was to recast the predominant narratives surrounding the outcomes and interpersonal relationships of youth experiencing homelessness. Accordingly, in order to obtain a more nuanced understanding of the developmental dimensions involved in the well-being of these youth, a number of questionnaires were administered to a group of 102 youth experiencing homelessness in the region of Montreal (Mage= 20, SD= 2.07, 30.4% female) during a program of research. In the 1st paper, I investigated the associations among attachment relationships with mothers, fathers, and peers, and the use of various socioecological resources that likely contribute to resilience among the youth. The findings revealed through linear regressions that higher self-reported levels of attachment with parental figures were associated with increased engagement in seeking support from others (relational resilience), while higher self-reported levels of peer attachment were associated with higher levels of engagement in personal coping techniques (individual resilience), such as locus of control, and of environmental resources (contextual resilience), such as the use of community and spiritual resources. Further, an exploratory analysis revealed gender differences between attachment figures and resilience domains. Specifically, individual resilience was highly correlated with maternal attachment for the female participants but not for the males. Conversely, individual resilience was also correlated with paternal and peer attachment for the males but not for the female participants. Further, relational resilience was significantly associated with maternal attachment among both males and females, but the magnitude of the relationship was significantly higher for the female participants. Relational resilience was also significantly correlated with paternal attachment among males, but not among the female participants. In the 2nd paper, I explored whether motivational orientations (autonomous versus controlled motivation) influenced coping styles (adaptive versus maladaptive coping) among the youth, and further examined whether attachment relationships and gender moderated this relationship. Four regression analyses were conducted and revealed that (1) autonomous motivation was significantly associated with the youth’s adaptive coping, with greater levels of autonomous motivation being associated with higher levels of adaptive coping; and that (2) controlled motivation was significantly associated with the youth’s maladaptive coping, with greater levels of controlled motivation being associated with higher levels of maladaptive coping. The findings revealed a significant main effect of peer attachment on adaptive coping, indicating that greater peer attachment was directly related to greater adaptive coping among the youth. The moderation analyses revealed no significant moderation effects for gender as well as maternal, paternal, and peer attachment. Overall, these findings provide an analysis of the relationships among factors implicated in the well-being of youth experiencing homelessness, add to our understanding of the factors that contribute to their adaptation and reveal the importance of attending to both individual and interpersonal factors when implementing prevention and intervention programs among this vulnerable population

AB  - Based on the structural-choice theory of victimization, the current study examines the effects of a high-risk environment on the sexual victimization of 311 homeless & runaway youth. Results from logistic regression revealed that survival sex, gender, & physical appearance were significantly associated with sexual victimization. Results from a series of interactions also revealed that the effects of deviant behaviors on sexual victimization varied by gender & age. Although males & females engaged in similar activities, young women were more likely to be victims of sexual assault. These findings suggest that engaging in high-risk behaviors predispose some people to greater risks, but it is the combination of these behaviors with gender &/or age that determine who will become victimized. 2 Tables, 3 Figures, 33 References.

Propensity score matching was conducted in estimating the effect of running away on high school dropout while controlling for confounding factors, such as familial instability and socioemotional health risks. The findings suggest that having runaway-homeless episodes have a detrimental effect on academic achievement.

AB  - Background: Poly-victimization is common among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) and youth in substance use treatment. To date, studies have not examined poly-victimization among these two intersecting populations. Objective: To examine heterogeneity in lifetime victimization experiences among youth reporting homelessness at substance use treatment entry; identify demographic predictors of victimization class membership; and associations between victimization and clinical characteristics at treatment intake. Participants and setting: 1270 adolescents and young adults reporting past 90-day homelessness in a nationwide substance use treatment data set. Methods: Latent Class Analysis (LCA) and logistic regression were used to examine heterogeneity in poly-victimization experiences, and associations with demographics and clinical characteristics for males and females. Results: Four victimization classes emerged for males, and five victimization classes emerged for females. The prevalence of victimization and trauma characteristics were higher for females, except physical victimization, which was higher for males. Age, race/ethnicity, and sexual minority status were related to poly-victimization class membership, but not consistently across classes. Compared to low or single victimization classes, youth in the poly-victimization class had higher odds of post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, and exchange sex (among females); Poly-victimization class membership was not associated with duration of recent homelessness or substance use disorder diagnoses, when compared to low/less complex victimization. Conclusion: High rates of lifetime victimization were found for YEH in substance use treatment, with rates generally higher among females. Trauma-informed interventions are needed to address complex victimization experiences and poor mental health among unstably housed youth in treatment.

AB  - Especially in the media, young homeless people are frequently presented as posing a violent threat to other members of the public. However, the economic circumstances, living situation and age of homeless youth are consistent with factors identified in victim research with vulnerability to violent crime. The present research explored the nature and extent of violent victimisation of homeless young people after they had left home. Intensive interviews were conducted with 51 homeless youth who were under the age of 18. Almost two-thirds of these young people had been physically assaulted and half had been sexually assaulted in the previous 12 months. The perpetrators of this violence were predominantly male. There were major differences in the nature of the violent experiences of the young men and the young women in terms of the relationship to the perpetrator, the location of the assault and the motivation. The demand for sex was a factor throughout the experiences of the young women.

AB  - This thesis focuses on the lived experiences of young men who are not in education, employment or training (NEET) and do not access support from the welfare benefits system. They have been called ‘hidden' NEETs as they are statistically absent from labour market datasets and seldom access support from charities and other organisations. The broad aims of this thesis are to understand how they become disengaged and how they search for meaning outside work.The thesis diverges from the traditional approaches of youth studies through an enhanced theorisation of ‘hidden NEEThood’ by incorporating a set of relational theories. Bourdieu is used to understand how the dispositions and resources available to the participants shape their disengagement from education, employment, training and the welfare benefits system. The thesis also incorporates Goffman’s theory of stigma as well as theories of ‘masculinity’ and ‘intersectionality’ to explore the roles of gender and ethnicity.In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with twenty-four young men living in Sheffield who were currently ‘hidden NEET’ or had recent experience of this status. The research presents several key findings. The literature review utilises Bourdieu's theory of ‘hysteresis’ to detail how long-term economic and policy processes have gradually created the conditions for ‘hidden NEEThood’. The empirical chapters also detail the overlooked proximity between homelessness and unemployment when ‘welfare conditionality’ and precarious labour markets intersect, in doing so, showing how very small amounts of social capital can result in significant differences to the lived experience of ‘hidden NEEThood’. Despite this, the thesis reveals how unemployment is not necessarily a state of marginalisation or disengagement as, for some, it can be a place of succour, particularly given experiences of 'poor work' in contemporary labour markets. A novel framework combines the concept of ontological security alongside the work of Bourdieu to explore the conditions and circumstances required for such young working-class men to feel ‘secure’ and find meaning in their lives. Finally, the thesis argues that NEEThood is not simply caused by poor employment prospects but is an outcome of wider socio-economic disadvantages.

AB  - This research compared technology use among homeless young adults with that of college students as a means of understanding technology use among young adults today; people who have grown up with technology. Specifically, social network site (SNS) usage was assessed for two age-matched young adult samples, one drawn from a large introductory psychology subject pool, and a second from homeless young adults who were approached for participation when they entered metropolitan shelters. Overall, technology use was strikingly similar. These results call for a paradigm shift in researchers' understanding of technology use and indicate that contemporary young adults sampled across socio-economic class and varying ethnicities are far more similar than prior research would suggest. These results call into question whether the term 'digital divide' is useful for describing group differences in technology use as our results suggest the divide has narrowed considerably.

AB  - This paper analyses the relationship between inadequate housing and the school performance of children from poor Czech households. It shows that children (ages 7-12) from low-income households (defined as those with up to 2.4 times the minimum living income) have higher chances of serious problems in school performance if they live in unstable or nonresidential housing. The effects of housing instability and non-residential housing among children from low-income households are significant and substantial even when controlling for parents' educational attainment and labour activity, family structure (e.g. single parent etc.), household size, and the child's age. The effects of other housing problems are significant only in their extreme forms (overcrowdedness) or when combined with other housing problems (the housing cost burden). These findings are used to examine whether the Czech Social Housing Act currently under discussion is needed to help poor families with children and whether it has adequately defined its target group if it is to protect Czech children from the negative effects of inadequate housing.

AB  - For homeless adolescents, alcohol and drugs are often 'functional', i.e. integrated in their daily lives, but still linked to various social and health risks. How do they experience the tensions between a subjective appropriateness of using drugs and alcohol and the possible risks of it? How do they deal with the risks of substance use and their already existing health problems because of their dependency and/or addiction? These questions are pursued on the background of our empirical-qualitative research project funded by the German Research Council (DFG) with a focus on homeless adolescents' health representations and practices. Our interviews addressed their life situations and their health concepts and practices and were complemented by participant observations in their urban settings. Four types of interpretive patterns and practices of alcohol and drug consumption could be identified from the analysis of our data. With regard to age and gender, they mainly differ in how far one's own use of substances is seen as risky and in the consequences the adolescents draw from this. The adolescents' subjective risk perceptions are confronted with their reported patterns of consumption of alcoholic beverages and drugs and their everyday practices, which could be observed. In the end, consequences from our study's results are discussed for how to design some sort of drug prevention that is specific for our target group. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Young adults (ages 18-24) are especially vulnerable to homelessness in the United States, and those experiencing homelessness exhibit high prevalence for many kinds of abuse and negative health outcomes. This article reviews common behavioral health issues facing homeless youth and assesses collective wisdom on effective treatments and services for this vulnerable population. On the whole, the research remains focused on individual-level risk and protective factors and service use patterns and preferences, which detracts from the structural issues that have shaped these individuals' experiences in the first place and are key to resolving them.

AB  - Studies of digital disparities have focused on socio-spatial differences across neighbourhoods, regions and other kinds of places, but the same place can produce different experiences of connectivity, a phenomenon labelled ‘variable geometries of connection’ by Crang, Crosbie and Graham (2006: 2551) [2006. Crang, M., Crosbie, T., & Graham, S. Variable geometries of connection: Urban digital divides and the uses of information technology. Urban Studies, 43(13), 2551–2570]. In this paper, I draw on research on the role of mobile phones and the internet for people experiencing homelessess in Australia to suggest that dependence on smartphones for access to information and communication when homeless, in combination with the design and regulation of urban spaces, structures the mobilities of homeless young people, resulting in distinctive connectivity needs and barriers. Homeless young people overcome many of their immediate difficulties of digital access through practices of ‘survival infrastructuring’, a term I propose to describe the practices of marginalised actors to make their media work in the face of uneven, precarious and costly connectivity. Highlighting these connectivity experiences and practices may help efforts to take action on digital exclusion and assist homeless young people by taking into account differential access needs within specific spatial and social contexts. I make this argument drawing on findings from two studies carried out between 2014 and 2016 on the access and use of the internet and mobile phones among homeless Australians.

AB  - Runaway and homeless youth often have a constellation of background behavioral, emotional, and familial problems that contribute to stress and maladaptive behaviors, which, in turn, can lead to self-harming and suicidal behaviors. The current study examined the roles of stress and maladaptive behaviors as mediators between demographic and psychosocial background characteristics and self-injurious outcomes through the lens of the stress process paradigm. The model was tested in a sample of runaway and homeless youth from Los Angeles County (N = 474, age 12-24, 41 % female, 17 % White, 32.5 % African American, 21.5 % Hispanic/Latino). Background variables (gender, age, sexual minority status, parental drug use history, and emotional distress) predicted hypothesized mediators of maladaptive behaviors and recent stress. In turn, it was hypothesized that the mediators would predict self-harming behaviors and suicide attempts in the last 3 months. Females and LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) youth were more likely to have self-harmed and attempted suicide; younger participants reported more self-harming. The mediating constructs were associated more highly with self-harming than suicide attempts bivariately, although differences were modest. Maladaptive behaviors and recent stress were significant predictors of self-harm, whereas only recent stress was a significant predictor of suicide attempts. All background factors were significant predictors of recent stress. Older age, a history of parental drug use, and greater emotional distress predicted problem drug use. Males, younger participants, and participants with emotional distress reported more delinquent behaviors. Significant indirect effects on self-harming behaviors were mediated through stress and maladaptive behaviors. The hypothesized paradigm was useful in explaining the associations among background factors and self-injurious outcomes and the influence of mediating factors on these associations.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This article uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 to examine the relationship between running away from home between the ages of 12 and 14 and dropping from high school among youth. Propensity score matching was conducted in estimating the effect of running away on high school dropout while controlling for confounding factors, such as familial instability and socioemotional health risks. The findings suggest that having runaway-homeless episodes have a detrimental effect on academic achievement. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

AB  - This paper examines the relationship between coresidence with adult children, wealth, and economic security using data from the 1999–2012 Canadian Survey of Financial Security (SFS). The results, obtained via propensity score matching and linear regression, show that coresidence with and parental support for adult children is negatively associated with non-home assets and positively associated with debt levels among Canadian households. Further analyses suggest that these relationships stem from differences in financial assets, retirement savings, student loan debt, and credit card balances. By linking theories of economic insecurity, social capital, and life course studies, this study demonstrates how changing trajectories among young adults and financial hardship can influence broader household resources and stability.

AB  - In his control balance theory Charles Tittle maintained that under favorable conditions unbalanced control ratios will lead to different forms of deviance. The type of deviance chosen is argued to depend on the degree of the control imbalance and the desirability the offense presents as a method of altering the imbalance. Utilizing a sample of homeless street youth this study examined if different types of control balance ratios were associated with hard and soft drug use. The findings revealed that control balance surpluses and control balance deficits were both related to hard and soft drug use but that these relationships were significantly stronger for hard drug use. Further, provocation and self-control were significant predictors of hard but not soft drug use while drug using peers predicted soft drug use but not hard drug use. Parental drug use, perceptions of risk, and values supportive of illegal behavior predicted both forms of drug use. Results are discussed and directions for further research and theoretical refinement are offered. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

AB  - Research to date has given little attention to differences in the experience of youth homelessness by ethnicity. This article provides a comparative descriptive analysis of the effect of differences and similarities in paths to homelessness, self-perception, and survival strategies on health behaviors and consequent health outcomes of African American and white homeless youth in San Francisco, USA. We conducted participant observation and ethnographic interviews with 54 youth primarily recruited from street venues. Hypotheses generated from the ethnographic data were validated in between-group analyses using concurrent epidemiological data collected from a sample of 205 youth. Our samples of unstably housed African American and white youth, though sharing common histories of family dysfunction, differed in both the ethnographic accounts and epidemiological analyses in their experiences of family, access to housing, street survival strategies, self-presentation, health behaviors and service utilization. Our sample of white youth generally identified with the term 'homeless,' engaged in survival activities associated with such a label, and accessed the services intended to address the needs of homeless youth. In contrast, our sample of African American youth generally did not perceive themselves as 'homeless,' a stigmatized term, and were thus less likely to utilize, or be accessed by, relevant services.

AB  - For poor families, the possession of assets--savings accounts, homes, and the like--has the potential not only to relieve some of the stress of living in poverty but also to make a better future seem like a real possibility. If children in families that own certain assets fare better than children in families without them, then helping poor families build those assets would be an effective strategy for two-generation programs. Indeed, write Michal Grinstein-Weiss, Trina Williams Shanks, and Sondra Beverly, plenty of evidence shows that assets are connected to positive outcomes for poor children. For example, young people who have any college savings at all, even a very small amount, are more likely to go to college; children in households with assets score higher on standardized achievement tests; and children of homeowners experience fewer behavioral problems. But this evidence comes from longitudinal data sets and is therefore correlational. Looking for causal relationships, the authors examine the results of experimental programs that opened various types of savings accounts for poor people and matched their contributions. Several of these trials included a control group that did not receive a savings account, making it possible to attribute any positive outcomes directly to the savings accounts rather than to their owners' personal characteristics. These programs dispelled the myth that poor people can't save; participants were generally able to accumulate savings. It's too early to tell, however, whether assets and asset-building programs have long-term effects on children's wellbeing, though one experiment found positive impacts on disadvantaged children's social-emotional development at age four. The most promising programs share several features: they are opened early in life; they are opened automatically, with no action required from the recipients; and they come with an initial deposit.

AB  - This research report compares characteristics of older homeless adults (age 55 & older) with younger homeless & examines gender differences within each age group. Data are drawn from intake interviews of 3,132 clients presenting at a local homeless center during a 3-year period. The authors find that older & younger clients differ significantly on many important characteristics, such as access to income, the duration of the current homeless episode, patterns of alcohol & substance abuse, & a history of having been in prison. There are also significant gender differences within age groups. The data suggest that pathways to homelessness among older women may be more crisis driven than those of men, whereas older men are more vulnerable to being chronically homeless than are older women. The findings highlight the necessity of considering age differences as well as gender differences among the homeless population in designing programs to reintegrate clients into stable living situations. 6 Tables, 28 References.

AB  - This pilot exploratory study evaluated the impact of the Young Mothers' Prenatal Group (YMPG) on single adolescent mothers' health and social outcomes. The YMPG provides comprehensive health and social intervention to pregnant and parenting adolescents aged 16 to 21 who are at risk for decreased health and social outcomes. The YMPG is a two-day prenatal seminar with informal prenatal and postnatal case management follow-up, and a one-day postpartum reunion. YMPG is based in one inner-city Toronto hospital. Young mothers delivering at a comparable inner-city Toronto hospital which does not have an adolescent prenatal program were included as a comparison group. Intervention mothers (n = 37) were followed from prenatal to postpartum status (before intervention, shortly after childbirth, and three months postpartum). Comparison mothers (n = 30) were surveyed at childbirth and at three months postpartum. Three primary outcome variables were examined: social support (Medical Outcomes Social Support Survey), depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and maternal confidence (Pharis Self-Confidence Scale). This research draws on an integration of two existing theoretical approaches (Social Networks and Social Support, and Social Cognitive Theory). The findings from this pilot study, using repeated measures MANCOVA, indicated that young mothers in the intervention group had significantly higher levels of maternal confidence than young mothers in the comparison group at three months postpartum. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in the levels of social support and depression. Analysis focused solely on the intervention group, using one-way repeated measures ANOVA, indicated a significant time effect from the prenatal to three-month postpartum period in the intervention group on each of the three main outcomes: social support, maternal confidence and depression. In addition, the analysis revealed that inner-city Canadian young mothers are a highly disadvantaged population with many problems including depression, poverty, and housing and food insecurity. It appears that the YMPG has an effect on maternal confidence but does not have a large effect on young mothers' levels of social support and depression. Future evaluations would benefit from a more intensive intervention, longer-term evaluations, much larger samples and a methodologically stronger design.

AB  - This research uses data from waves I and IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health, N = 9,631) to consider whether and how family instability in early or later childhood affects college enrollment and completion of a Bachelor's degree by age 24. Explanatory factors include maternal selection into unstable unions, household resources available in adolescence, and adolescents' academic achievement, behavior, and attitudes in high school. The association of later family instability with college enrollment and completion is largely explained by household resources in adolescence. The association of early family instability with college enrollment is partially explained by each set of factors, and its association with college completion, given enrollment, is explained by pre-existing maternal characteristics. The results demonstrate that early family instability has enduring consequences for eventual status attainment and that the mechanisms that connect family instability to educational outcomes vary by the timing of family structure change.

AB  - Summarizes the results of six surveys conducted via mail, telephone, & face-to-face interviews in Finland since 1992, excluding the institutionalized & homeless, to investigate the lifetime prevalence of cannabis use among men, women, & young adults ages 18-29. Results indicate that the annual relative increase in the prevalence of cannabis use, 1992-1996, has been 9% for men, 4% for women, & 11% for young adults. In comparison with the results of mail surveys, telephone & face-to-face interviews yielded considerably lower prevalence figures, especially among women. Methodologically, an increase of 1% in the response rate raises the prevalence figure by 3%. Although these results are based on fairly large samples & are consistent with previous studies, it should be noted that the estimates of the effects of the data collection method & the response rate are essentially based on the results of one particular study, creating some doubts about their generalizability. 2 Tables, 9 References.

AB  - Community-based youth shelters are the primary method of intervention designed to meet the complex needs of at-risk youth who leave home before they have developed the skills to live independently. This research examines shelter users' patterns of cross-sector service use to better understand the needs and resources of shelter residents. The aims of this study are (1) to perform an inter-group analysis, comparing sheltered youth with status offense runaways and foster care runaways, and (2) to explore the population of emergency shelter residents using an intra-group analysis, determining whether distinct profiles of sheltered youth exist, based on individual characteristics and service use patterns over time. The study samples were drawn from a larger longitudinal study of services and outcomes. The samples included subjects born between 1981 and 1992 who were reported for child maltreatment and/or lived in families receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children during childhood. For the first Aim, the sample included subjects identified as runaway by the court system (status offense runaways), foster care runaways, and sheltered youth. The sample for the second aim included only sheltered youth. Bivariate analyses found differences between runaway groups in terms of poverty, maltreatment history, school-identified disability, report of neglect, receipt of family services, delinquent offenses, truancy, ethnicity, and parent mental health or substance abuse treatment. Controlling for covariates in the multinomial logistic regression, only age discriminated between all three groups. Just 20% of the sheltered youth ran away from their previous residence or spent time living on the street. Latent class analysis suggests sheltered youth fall into four clearly distinct categories, clearly defined by connection to school and family. These include: (1) a 'parent time-out' group (attending school and living with family), (2) a school/behavior problem group (not attending school and living with family), (3) youth in DFS custody placed at the shelter (disconnected from family but attending school), and (4) multi-problem youth (disconnected from both school and family).

AB  - This article aims to contribute to understandings of youth homelessness and subjectivity by analysing identity construction in terms of young people's negotiation of the structural and institutional environment of youth homelessness. I suggest that while existing literature on this topic concentrates mainly on micro-social encounters, the identities of young people experiencing homelessness can be understood as constructed by structural processes described by Ulrich Beck's individualisation thesis. Narratives from 20 Australian young people are analysed for how their identities are constructed in their contact with the institutions which govern youth homelessness, and the way these young people make sense of the structural conditions they are facing. Two narrative trajectories are identified. In narratives describing movement into homelessness, young people articulate feelings of failure and shame, consequences of their individualised understanding of their biography. In narratives describing movement out of homelessness into a home, young people articulate feelings of strength and pride, while also describing those who remain homeless in ways which reflect the status of homelessness as a stigmatised difference. This article concludes by discussing the way that structural, institutional and subjective processes interact to produce the identities of young people experiencing homelessness, and reflects on the utility of understanding youth homelessness as a form of individualised social inequality.

AB  - Young adults who are pregnant or parents are a vulnerable subgroup of the homeless population, yet there is limited research about their specific service needs. To fill this gap, we used data from a survey of homeless and unstably housed young adults, ages 18-24, collected over 4 weeks in Houston, Texas, to examine the characteristics, risk factors, and protective factors of homeless parents (n = 109) compared to other homeless young adults (n = 243), then differences between mothers (n = 61) and fathers (n = 48). Unique risk and protective profiles for homeless parents were identified, as well as differences between mothers and fathers. Implications for service delivery targeted to the unique needs of young adult homeless mothers and fathers are discussed.

AB  - Many transgender (trans) young adults migrate to urban enclaves with known infrastructures to fulfil gender affirmation needs such as obtaining trans-inclusive healthcare and support. This study sought to explore experiences of intranational migration (i.e. migration within a single country) for gender affirmation among trans young adults who relocated to San Francisco. A convenience sample of 61 trans young adults aged 18 to 29 (32% nonbinary, 28% trans women, and 40% trans men; 84% identified as a person of colour) participated in a one-time qualitative interview as part of a larger study. Thematic analysis was used to develop and refine the codes and themes. Three overarching themes became apparent regarding intranational migration and gender affirmation needs: (1) access to basic gender affirmation needs; (2) safety; and (3) the price of gender affirmation. Migration for gender affirmation and safety placed informants at risk for structural vulnerabilities including homelessness, unemployment and racism. Despite these structural vulnerabilities, participants were willing to “pay” the price in order to gain gender affirmation and safety. Findings underscore the importance of moving beyond individual-level risk factors to understand how unmet gender affirmation needs may place trans young adults in structurally vulnerable positions that can affect health and wellness.

AB  - Latest developments in modern societies have altered living circumstances. Upcoming insecurities concerning employment & family relationships make life more & more incalculable. Especially young adults throughout the modern world are forced to rethink their life concepts & to desist from the lives of former generations. As difficulties to achieve a successful life increase, one could assume that the young are confronted with the impossibility of feeling happy & satisfied with their lives anymore. Yet, latest social surveys prove wrong. Although increasing unemployment, lower net income & single parenthood make life more difficult for the young, they still enjoy very high subjective quality of life in comparison to the older population. Throughout the paper I argue that it is not the objective conditions that make young adults (15-29 years old) feel overwhelmingly happy. Looking for other sources of explanation of high quality of life among people aged 29 or below, I argue for indicators of social embeddedness as being influential on their assessment of life. But again, the proportion of explained variance is smaller compared to older people. With the help of empirical data taken from the European Social Survey I highlight the differences in life circumstances between the young & the total population. Concerning occupation, habitation (kind of inhabited household) & financial situation, most of the young live under different situations compared to the adult world. But surprisingly, the rates of perceived high quality of life among the young do not vary to such a large extent as among the adults. I show that young adults, often damned to fail social demands because of their withdrawal from social life, are still the most happy in modern (more & more individualizing?) societies. But it gets more difficult to account for the reasons of their happiness. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Background The experience of homelessness and child protection involvement pose risks to children's school success. Elucidating processes by which these interrelated systems affect child well-being is important for guiding policy and practice. Objective This study examines the temporal relation between emergency shelter or transitional housing use and child protection involvement among school-aged children. We evaluated effects of both risk indicators on school attendance and school mobility. Participant and setting Using integrated administrative data, we identified 3278 children (ages 4 to 15) whose families used emergency or transitional housing in Hennepin and Ramsey County of Minnesota during the 2014 and 2015 academic years. A propensity-score-matched comparison group of 2613 children who did not use emergency or transitional housing. Method Through a series of logistic regressions and generalized estimating equations, we tested the temporal associations of emergency/transitional housing and child protection involvement as well as how both experiences affected school attendance and mobility. Results Experiences of emergency or transitional housing often proceeded or occurred concurrently with child protection involvement and increased the likelihood of child protection services. Emergency or transitional housing and child protection involvement posed risks for lower school attendance and greater school mobility. Conclusions A multisystem approach to assist families across social services may be important for stabilizing children's housing and bolstering their success at school. A two-generation approach focused on residential and school stability and enhancing family resources could boost adaptive success of family members across contexts.

Substance use, family functioning, & related problem behaviors were examined in a sample of Hispanic & Anglo runaway youths with substance abuse diagnoses (N = 145). Youths, aged 12-17, were recruited from two urban, southwestern runaway shelters. Within single-parent families, Anglo youths reported more marijuana use, &, regardless of family constitution, reported more tobacco use than did Hispanic youths. Overall, Anglo youths reported more externalizing problems & more conflict tactics used in resolving disagreements with their primary caretaker while Hispanic youths reported higher depression & familism scores. Given the differences found between Hispanic & Anglo youths, the findings argue that culturally sensitive interventions for runaway youths & families are warranted. 4 Tables, 64 References.

AB  - Using data from a natural experiment in Denver, we investigate whether the initiation of running away from home, aggressive or violent behavior, and marijuana use during adolescence are statistically related to the neighborhood contexts in which low-income Latino and African American youth were raised. Our analysis is based on retrospective child, caregiver, household, and neighborhood data for a sample of approximately 850 Latino and African American youth whose families were quasi-randomly assigned to public housing operated by the Denver (CO) Housing Authority during part of their childhood. We used Cox PH models and accelerated failure time models to estimate ethnic differentials in the hazards and timing of initiation of these risky behaviors during adolescence. We found that multiple dimensions of neighborhood context—especially safety, ethnic and nativity composition, and socioeconomic status—strongly and robustly predicted initiation of running away, aggressive or violence behavior, and marijuana use during adolescence.

AB  - Ghana has made great progress in improving undernutrition, but child stunting and adult overweight remain public health concerns. Nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) interventions have been widely advocated to reduce the burden of malnutrition. The theoretical pathways by which such interventions improve nutrition have been well established, and the evidence linking these interventions to intermediate outcomes, such as food security and dietary intake, has increased in the past decades. Notwithstanding, there is still a dearth of studies that demonstrate that NSA interventions can impact nutritional status, partly due to the complexity of such interventions. In response, researchers have recommended using process-oriented evaluations to understand the bottlenecks to achieving impact.The 2014-17 Nutrition Links (NL) project included a cluster randomized controlled trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01985243) – a NSA intervention aiming to improve infant and young child feeding practices in the Upper Manya Krobo District of Ghana. This intervention recruited caregivers with children < 18 months. In the 19 intervention communities, 233 of the 287 enrolled women self-selected to receive poultry layers, garden inputs, and nutrition education. Weekly meetings were used for education, for the staff to document egg production, and for the women to repay their birds and purchase feed. The 213 women in the 20 control communities continued to receive standard-of-care health and agriculture services offered by the district. At endline, children in the intervention group were more likely to meet the minimum dietary diversity (MDD) (aOR = 1.65, 95% CI [1.02, 2.69]) and had improved growth Z-score indicators (length-for-age (LAZ)/height‐for‐age (HAZ) (aβ = 0.22, 95% CI [0.09, 0.34]) and weight‐for‐age (WAZ) (aβ = 0.15, 95% CI [0.00, 0.30])). This dissertation was embedded within the NL project and had the following objectives: (i) determine the association between maternal level of participation in NL and child diet and growth outcomes, (ii) understand the barriers and facilitators to participate in a NSA intervention, and (iii) estimate the association between marital transition and household food insecurity and women’s nutrition outcomes.The first study used data from the NL baseline and endline surveys in addition to a participation level indicator generated for this thesis. After four (Phase 1) and three (Phase 2) months of the completion of the NL endline data collection, the NL field staff evaluated each woman who adopted the intervention and received poultry on a scale from very poor (1) to excellent (5) on each of the following criteria: 1) egg productivity; 2) timely and complete payment for feed and birds; 3) meeting attendance; 4) answering questions and making comments during the meetings; 5) attentiveness and helpfulness with group members. This evaluation was done by consensus twice, one month apart, for each Phase. The participation level of each intervention woman was classified as high, medium, or low, based on tertiles of the summative score of the five items or as “no participation” for those who did not adopt the intervention. Logistic regression mo s tested the likelihood of children consuming eggs and meeting the MDD, and linear regression models estimated the changes in anthropometric indices for the four participation levels compared to those of the controls. Compared to the control group, only a high level of participation was associated with an increased likelihood in egg consumption (aOR = 2.87, 95% CI [1.21, 6.82]) and WAZ (aβ = 0.30, 95% CI [0.05, 0.55]). Both medium and high participation levels were associated with an increase in LAZ/HAZ (aβ = 0.45, 95% CI [0.17, 0.73] and aβ = 0.43, 95% CI [0.16, 0.70]).

AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Family, work and well-being over the life courseThe economic and social contribution young people make to society is increasingly important as the population ages. Yet a substantial number of young people face economic and social challenges that have an impact on their current and future well-being. Independent indicators are often used to describe what we know about how young people are faring, but these fail to show how young people are doing holistically, across their whole life. If we are to better understand and improve young people's well-being and their lives more generally, it is critical that research establishes the connections and interactions between life domains. This paper uses a well-being framework and secondary analysis of national statistics to begin to understand how young people are faring when we cross economic outcomes with other social indicators. It argues that some Australian young people fare poorly across a large number of other social indicators and thus may be walking a tightrope in regard to their well-being and well-becoming. This paper also aims to generate a dialogue about using a well-being framework for future research with and about young people.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This article presents a non-experimental, exploratory study of the experiences of unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness in Washington, DC. Using a community-based participatory action approach, researchers conducted open-ended survey interviews with 57 participants, all of whom identified as persons of color. Findings offer insight on where youth stay most evenings, what precipitated youths’ most recent experience of homelessness, strategies used to cope or survive on the streets, primary service needs, and advice from youth experiencing homelessness. The youth’s family experiences were an important factor in their experiences of homelessness. Implications for social work practice, policy, and research are discussed.

AB  - Homeownership is increasingly understood by policy makers and social scientists as a fundamental asset against poverty risks, especially in times of economic uncertainty. However, in several Western countries, homeownership among younger generations appears to be increasingly difficult to achieve, likely a result of growing employment instability and stringent criteria to access credit. This article uses multinomial logistic models and nationally representative EU-SILC data from six European countries to examine (a) to what extent precarious employment among young couples is linked to being a mortgage holder; (b) whether earned income can compensate for employment instability in being a mortgagee; (c) cross-national differences in the relationship between being a mortgage holder, earnings, and employment insecurity. Our results indicate that the higher the levels of employment insecurity, the lower the chances of being a mortgage holder in all countries. Moreover, we find that at a given level of employment insecurity, households with higher levels of earned income have higher chances of being mortgage holders than households with lower earned income. However, while earned income has a stronger effect in achieving a mortgage among couples who have secure employment in Italy, earnings are more important among couples with lower levels of employment security in France, the UK, Spain and Poland. These results suggest that the relationship between social inequalities and housing is partially mediated by the national context.

The study is based on 44 intensive interviews with the former runaways, their nonrunaway siblings, their parents, and other relatives. Four major questions were addressed. Marked differences in outcomes were found (a) between runaways and their siblings; (b) between runaway repeaters and nonrepeaters, and (c) between runaways from working-class backgrounds and those from middle-class backgrounds. In general, whatever their other statuses, children who ran away more than once showed increasing personal and social dysfunction as young adults.

AB  - Background High household density increases exposure to communicable diseases, psychological distress in adults, and poor long-term health in children. High residential density, which may be a mediator of poor health, is common among immigrants. Methods We used data from a pilot survey among Mexican immigrants in New York City. Respondents were recruited through venue-based sampling in neighborhoods with large Mexican populations. Results Among respondents that reported being undocumented (N = 404), the mean number of people per room (PPR) of residence was 2.2. In multivariate analyses, living in conditions of >2 PPR was positively associated with living with one's children (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.4-3.9), having experienced food insecurity in the past 6 months (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.1-3.6), and language discrimination (OR = 2.3 compared to other forms of discrimination, 95% CI = 1.2-4.4). Conclusions Undocumented Mexican immigrants, particularly those who are linguistically marginalized and experience food insufficiency, live in conditions of marked household density in NYC.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

Analysis indicates that young adult males have the highest rates of alcohol misuse compared with all other age groups. Beginning to drink at an early age & growing up with a heavy drinking father are strong predictors of both current heavier drinking & alcohol-related problems; for males, the effect of father's drinking is especially strong. Living in a dorm as a college student also makes a unique contribution to alcohol misuse. 3 Tables, 2 Figures, 36 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This qualitative study examined the meanings ascribed to the construct "home" by 208 youths defined by mainstream society as "homeless". Youth narratives on the topic of home ranged across a continuum with home as state at one end (i.e., home is a state of mind, comprised of one's friends) and home as place at the other (i.e., home as a physical dwelling). Youths employing the former meanings had typically been on the street for longer periods and identified with counterculture-type ideologies. For youths who defined home as place, home was constructed in direct opposition to street experiences. For both of these groups, control emerged as a central theme in their narratives. The implications of these findings for engaging youth and goal setting regarding exiting the streets are described. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

It is not clear, however, whether these findings reflect preemancipation developmental deficits. This study used 163 preemancipation foster care youth and a matched sample of 163 comparison youth. Results showed that foster-care youth did not differ from the comparison sample on measures of well-being, including depressed mood, problem behavior, and self-esteem. Foster care youth reported higher levels of work orientation, but lower levels of academic achievement, aspirations, and expectations. In addition, compared to the matched sample, foster care youth perceived better social environments with respect to their important nonparental adults (VIPs) and peers, but poorer social environments relating to their parents. These differences in social environments may have offset each other and resulted in similar levels of psychological well-being for the two groups of youth. Regression analyses further showed that social environments were linked to selected adolescent outcomes, and nonparental VIPs were especially important for the foster care sample.

AB  -  Family aggression patterns and behavior problems of children, aged 6-12, recruited from shelters for battered women (shelter group) were contrasted with three comparison groups of currently nonviolent families: two-parent, single-mother, and homeless.  Girls who had been exposed to recent interparental wife abuse were predicted to show more internalizing and externalizing behavior problems than similarly exposed boys, based on recent literature.

AB  - A sample of 43 homeless adolescents was interviewed & categorized as being either runaways, throwaways, or societal rejects. The 3 categories were compared to assess the descriptive utility of internal social control, strain, & psychopathological theory in making distinctions among them. Descriptive data support the view that control & psychopathology perspectives provide some promise for understanding differing types of runaway adolescents. Sex differences between runaway & throwaway youths were explored. However, few sex X category interactions were observed. Implications for secondary prevention are offered. 1 Table, 21 References.

AB  - This qualitative study examined the meanings ascribed to the construct "home" by 208 youths defined by mainstream society as "homeless". Youth narratives on the topic of home ranged across a continuum with home as state at one end (i.e., home is a state of mind, comprised of one's friends) and home as place at the other (i.e., home as a physical dwelling). Youths employing the former meanings had typically been on the street for longer periods and identified with counterculture-type ideologies. For youths who defined home as place, home was constructed in direct opposition to street experiences. For both of these groups, control emerged as a central theme in their narratives. The implications of these findings for engaging youth and goal setting regarding exiting the streets are described. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

AB  - Objective: To examine family risk factors associated with dissociative symptoms among homeless and runaway youth.  Method: Three hundred and twenty-eight homeless and runaway youth were interviewed using a systematic sampling strategy in metropolitan Seattle. Homeless young people were interviewed on the streets and in shelters by outreach workers in youth service agencies.  Results: The current study revealed widespread prevalence of dissociative symptoms among these young people. Multivariate analyses revealed that sexual abuse, physical abuse, and family mental health problems were all positively associated with dissociative symptoms. No gender differences were found for any of the models.  Conclusions: Dissociative behavior is widespread among these youth and may pose a serious mental health concern. Some young people experience numerous stressors, and with few resources and little support available, many may invoke maladaptive strategies such as dissociative behavior to handle such situations, which may in turn be detrimental to their mental health. Unless youth are provided with programs and intervention, the cycle of abuse that they have experienced at home is likely to continue on the street.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This study explores the impact of adolescent part-time work experience on problem behaviors in the South Korean context. To achieve this, propensity score matching (PSM) analyses were employed based on data from the Korean Education Employment Panel (KEEP). Results indicate that adolescents' part-time employment during their secondary school years had significantly undesirable effects on drinking and smoking, even after preexisting differences between the two groups (i.e., those adolescents who participated in part-time work and those who did not) were controlled by PSM. However, an insignificant difference was detected in the likelihood of running away from home. Implications of the results are discussed in terms of changes in the meanings of adolescence and of participating in part-time work in South Korea.

AB  - Explores the boundary change in criminal justice policy in the 1990s in which criminal courts & adult corrections began to take jurisdiction over juveniles once adjudicated in juvenile courts & managed in juvenile justice systems. At the same time, juvenile justice programs have begun working with runaways, incorrigibles, curfew violators, those experimenting with alcohol & smoking, truants, & other status offenders (Feld 1999) who were once dealt with by families, neighbors, schools, youth development agencies, & other nonjudicial entities (Shiraldi & Soler 1998). Zero-tolerance rhetoric has supplemented the informal, private control that schools have maintained through the affective influence of teachers, coaches, staff, & students, yet expanding formal controls of law enforcement has weakened these informal controls. The Southeastern County Truancy Reduction & Intervention Collaborative is placed in the context of the expanded juvenile justice boundaries. The restorative justice framework is briefly presented as an alternative to expansionist & libertarian policies. L. A. Hoffman

Even after controlling for potential effects of behavioral disorders (oppositional defiant, attention deficit hyperactivity, & conduct disorder) & alcohol dependence or abuse, homeless adolescents were found to have experienced significantly more parental maltreatment & were scolded by their parents more often than housed adolescents. The homeless youths reported feelings of less parental love & less family cohesion, significantly more verbal & physical aggression with parents, & more family conflict in general. 2 Tables, 43 References.

AB  - A follow-up study to Carol Gilligan's (1982) work in female adolescent moral development was conducted in the presentation of a hypothetical moral sexual situation to 8 culturally diverse females, age 18-20, in their first year of college. The naming of a "good friend's" conflict & the personal moral reasoning of the interviewees were audiotaped, transcribed, & analyzed, using a sequence of four readings as subscribed by Gilligan et al (1994). Findings reveal no racial differences in the types of conflicts experienced & reactions to them. It was also found that females, while capable of reasoning in a law & justice tradition, typically will not reason in this vein. Further, females who are not socially & economically advantaged tend to be more advanced in their care reasoning than they are about justice. Examples of justice reasoning, care reasoning, & integrated moral reasoning are presented along with suggestions for educators & therapists. 2 Tables, 21 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - In this study, I compared the shifts in attitude of affluent high school seniors participating in a course on social justice issues to a control group of similar adolescents. In this course, participating adolescents learned about social justice issues such as homelessness, poverty, world hunger, and illegal immigration. An analysis of presurvey and postsurvey data revealed that the adolescents participating in the social justice course experienced a decline over the course of the semester in their support for educational equity between wealthy and poor communities. Interviews with these adolescents and analyses of their student work revealed that their shifts in attitude were influenced by fears about the possibility of one day becoming poor or homeless themselves.

AB  - The current study employs data from the U.S. National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 10,818; 56% female; 21% African American) to test how experiencing homelessness through emerging adulthood and child maltreatment predict adult property crime and violent crime. Unlike many published studies on homelessness, we used propensity score matching to correct for selection bias between homeless and nonhomeless individuals. Logistic regression models were run to predict violent and property crime in adulthood, controlling for child maltreatment. Participants who experienced homelessness by age 26 were 1.6 times more likely to commit violent crime in adulthood and almost 30% more likely to commit property crime. Those who were victims of child maltreatment were 15 times more likely to commit property crime, but no more likely to commit violent crime. Findings show that comparing statistically equivalent groups, homelessness through emerging adulthood significantly predicted adult criminality while child maltreatment showed more variable results. Greater prevention efforts aimed at children and adolescents at high risk of experiencing homelessness, as well as more intensive outreach services to homeless youth, may moderate exposure and reduce reliance on criminal survival behaviors.

AB  - Young adults experiencing homelessness (YAEH) are at elevated risk for violence victimization and perpetration. However, there are no evidence‐based violence prevention interventions for homeless populations. This study is an evaluation of a novel mindfulness‐based peer‐leader intervention designed to reduce violence and improve mindfulness in YAEH. A social network of YAEH receiving services at a drop‐in agency was recruited in Summer 2018 (n = 106) and peer‐leaders identified at baseline (n = 12). Peer leaders were trained in mindfulness and yoga skills during a 1‐day intensive workshop and seven 1‐h weekly follow‐up workshops and encouraged to share their knowledge with in‐network peers. Postintervention data were collected 2 and 3 months after baseline. Two one‐way repeated‐measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) tested differences in means for mindfulness and fighting. ANOVA models showed significant increases in group mean mindfulness F(2, 110) = 3.42, p < 0.05 and significant decreases in group mean violent behavior F(2, 112) = 5.23, p < 0.01 at the network level. Findings indicate a network‐based, peer‐leader model can be effective for influencing complex, socially conditioned attitudes and behaviors among YAEH. Additional advantages of the peer‐leader model include relatively few direct‐service person‐hours required from providers and convenience to participants able practice skills in their relevant social contexts.

AB  - Researchers of street life and homelessness in the United States continue to acknowledge the persistence of nomadism among the young and homeless, yet we know little about the role that travel plays in their lives or the meanings and motivations tied to this contemporary experience. Drawing on in-depth interviews, we compare homeless youth and young adults that travel with those that do not. Building on theories of social networks, social capital, stigma, and identity we explore demographic, behavioral, and philosophical similarities and differences between the two groups to understand the rationale for travel. For the young and homeless today, travel adds to the reserve of strategies to build and maintain network affiliations, acquire resources, and manage stigma and identity as they relate to the hobo and transient traditions of the past. However, when compared to their non-traveling homeless counterparts, travelers face new challenges that offset the purported benefits derived from being mobile.

To determine differences between the two populations, the study used a guiding conceptual model of social estrangement that included four domains: institutional disaffiliation, psychological dysfunction, human capital, and identification with homeless culture. A sample of homeless youth (N = 96; 46 from St. Louis, 50 from Austin) were recruited through youth-serving agencies. Findings indicate two unique samples of street-involved youth in regards to affiliation with formal institutions, family support, and informal peer networks, suggesting distinct service needs.

AB  - This community‐based study investigated whether (1) a novel sport psychology informed positive youth development program, My Strengths Training for Life™, improved resilience and well‐being and (2) young people differed in outcomes according to demographics (gender, ethnicity, social inclusion, and learning difficulty). A total of 246 young people (M age = 19.74, SD = 2.31) living in a large housing service completed questionnaires on demographics, mental skills, and pre and postprogram resilience and well‐being. Baseline differences in resilience and well‐being existed for ethnicity and learning difficulty status but did not influence MST4Life™ outcomes. There was a significant improvement in resilience and well‐being over time, which was associated with mental skills development. Implications apply for policy, program commissioners, and research: (1) novel sport psychology interventions can improve the well‐being of disadvantaged youth, and (2) demographics at baseline should be considered in intervention planning and evaluation with this population.

AB  - Running away from home has often been viewed as one of the sequels to sexual abuse. In a study of adolescent runaways (N = 89 Ms & 55 Fs) interviewed at a shelter in Toronto, Ontario, 38% of M runaways & 73% of F runaways reported having been sexually abused. The impact of abuse is examined by studying, within each gender group, its relation to the S's perceptions of sexual activity, relationships with peers & adults, involvement with delinquent/criminal activities, & physical & emotional complaints. The results show that abused Ms & Fs are more likely to report anxiety & suicidal feelings than their nonabused counterparts. M victims of sexual abuse are more likely to report physical symptomatology & fear of adult men; F victims are more likely to be confused about sex & to engage in delinquent/criminal activities. Differences in the degree of abuse & the sex of the abuser may help explain these findings. 5 Tables, 49 References. Modified HA

AB  - There are two factors that limit our knowledge of the risk factors associated with homelessness among runaway adolescents, namely (1) the samples used are often composed of youth homeless service users &/or youths living on the streets (visible homelessness), whereas most adolescents in fact use "private" resources (hidden homelessness), & (2) failure to use an adequate control group to identify risk factors associated specifically with homelessness. Our study compares the characteristics of two groups of youths under the supervision of the youth protection system, according to the presence or absence of periods of homelessness. The results throw light on the factors underlying the shift from "at risk" to "homeless," showing that youths with experience of homelessness are more likely to have been placed in substitute home environments, have experienced significant relationship difficulties with one of their parents (deterioration of the parent/youth relationship & parental abuse) & to have been diagnosed with behavioural disorders. The findings suggest that the decision to place young people under supervision is based more on the dynamic between risk factors rather than on the existence of behavioural problems. 4 Tables, 56 References.

AB  - Path analysis was used to investigate the impact of childhood sexual abuse on later sexual victimization among 372 homeless & runaway youth in Seattle. Young people were interviewed directly on the streets & in shelters by outreach workers in youth service agencies. High rates of both childhood sexual abuse & street sexual victimization were reported, with females experiencing much greater rates compared with their male counterparts. Early sexual abuse in the home increased the likelihood of later sexual victimization on the streets indirectly by increasing the amount of time at risk, deviant peer affiliations, participating in deviant subsistence strategies, & engaging in survival sex. These findings suggest that exposure to dysfunctional & disorganized homes place youth on trajectories for early independence. Subsequently, street life & participation in high-risk behaviors increases their probability of sexual victimization. 4 Tables, 2 Figures, 48 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - We report the results of an intervention that targeted anti-Roma sentiment in Hungary using an online perspective-taking game. We evaluated the impact of this intervention using a randomized experiment in which a sample of young adults played this perspective-taking game, or an unrelated online game. Participation in the perspective-taking game markedly reduced prejudice, with an effect-size equivalent to half the difference between voters of the far-right and the center-right party. The effects persisted for at least a month, and, as a byproduct, the intervention also reduced antipathy toward refugees, another stigmatized group in Hungary, and decreased vote intentions for Hungary's overtly racist, far-right party by 10%. Our study offers a proof-of-concept for a general class of interventions that could be adapted to different settings and implemented at low costs.

AB  - The Intensive Protective Supervision Project (IPSP) in NC targeted undisciplined youths, eg, status offenders (SOs) or youths referred to the courts for runaway, truant, or ungovernable behaviors, with the assumption that most SOs had not yet become delinquent. The program involved extensive & proactive contact between the court counselor, the SO, & the SO's family. At the time of its initiation, experimental IPSP & regular protective supervision (RPS) groups were drawn randomly from a pool of potential clients. Field observations made at 4 sites during the project's first year & a statistical description of the client population are presented. Evaluation measured impacts of IPSP & RPS treatment procedures, controlling for demographic characteristics. Findings include that IPSP, compared to RPS, is more effective in reducing the incidence of serious or delinquent offenses, but that the intensive supervision process may result in an increased rate of citations for technical violations. IPSP treatment procedure remained substantial & statistically significant when regression analysis was performed for age, sex, race, & number of offenses. Given the available data & sample sizes, IPSP is regarded as promising but tentative. In Comments on "Something That Works in Juvenile Justice," Joan McCord (Temple U, Philadelphia, Pa) commends IPSP for random assignment of probationers to target & control groups, detailed record keeping, & its tentative success. It is suggested that dose-response evaluations include measures of the amount of individuation, degree of supervision, & quality of behavior evaluation, & that differential effects of treatment for different types of families & different types of juveniles be determined. 11 References.

AB  - Introduction Research indicates that sexual and romantic relationships play an important role in youth well-being and development. This strengths-based perspective sits in tension with the documented risks that youth with histories of maltreatment face in sexual/romantic relationships. We conducted a U.S.-based mixed-method study to examine the connection between childhood maltreatment and youth relationships. Method We collected retrospective ratings of relationship quality and open-ended comments about those relationships using an online sexual life history calendar. Quantitative analyses drew on data from 98 participants (51 cisgender women, 47 cisgender men) between the ages of 18–25 (Mage = 22.51). Qualitative analyses compared demographically matched subsamples of 19 participants who reported multiple forms of child maltreatment and 20 who reported none. Results Quantitative analyses indicated that ratings of relationship stability, intimacy, and pleasure were unrelated to prior abuse or neglect. Qualitative analyses showed the relationships of those with multiple maltreatment histories, compared to those without any maltreatment, to be more often intertwined with and complicated by other hardships (e.g., homelessness). Conclusions Quantitatively, childhood maltreatment appeared unrelated to youth sexual/romantic relationship quality, though we regard those findings with due caution. Complementing this was qualitative evidence of differences between participants based on trauma histories, with those who had experienced childhood maltreatment referring more often to surrounding circumstances and hardships in descriptions of their youth sexual/romantic relationships. These mixed method findings reinforce the importance of youth sexuality research, policy, and practice that takes the broader conditions of young people's lives into consideration.

AB  - Problem: Various demographic & familial risk factors have been linked to runaway behavior. To date, there has not been a systematic investigation of the impact of size of community on runaway behavior. This study will compare runaways from smaller cities & rural areas to their urban counterparts. Methods: A convenience sample of 602 adolescents was interviewed between 1995 & August of 1996 in Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, & Kansas, USA. Multiple regression was used to examine the association between gender, neglect, sexual abuse, physical abuse, geographic & family structure change, & community size of first runaway to predict age at first runaway, deviant subsistence strategies, & street victimization. Results: Findings indicate that adolescents exposed to neglect (b = -.20) & sexual abuse (b = -.16) ran away sooner & were more likely to be victimized on the street. Rural adolescents who experienced higher levels of physical abuse relied more heavily on deviant subsistence strategies (b = .15) & remained in abusive homes longer (b = .15) than their similarly situated urban counterparts. Conclusions: Rural youth who have been subjected to elevated levels of familial abuse are at greater risk of deviant subsistence strategies, which increase the likelihood of street victimization.

AB  - The first section consists of six chapters covering a general history and the key schools of contemporary critical criminology: feminist, left realist, postmodern, peacemaking and newsmaking criminology. Beginning with Michael Lynch's historical overview, "Class, Race, Gender and Criminology: Structured Choices and the Life Course", the reader is rapidly introduced to the political and intellectual context in which this book is located. According to Lynch, it is only recently that "issues and voices that had been repressed to the margins of the radical approach have become more central to the development of critical criminology." As a result, "forms of theory that place race and gender center stage along side class issues are increasingly offered by critical theorists, and have been welcomed into the center of radical thought" (5). The studies by Mona Danner and Walter DeKeseredy explore the extent to which marginal voices have been incorporated into the centre of critical criminology. These two essays about socialist feminism and left realism jointly represent the traditional format of critical criminology. According to the authors, feminist and left realist criminology have their own histories of ideas which have excluded certain categories of oppression. Socialist feminists stand accused of discounting race, while left realists are criticised for ignoring both race and gender. Summarising the scope of each theoretical approach, Danner and DeKeseredy briefly propose new ways of including the previously marginalised elements within the original framework of feminism and left realism. Despite the authors" intentions, however, it remains unclear whether these formerly denied categories can be introduced so belatedly, or whether the primary theoretical paradigms themselves have to be changed.Beginning with Meda Chesney-Lind's contribution, "Sentencing Women to Prison: Equality Without Justice", it rapidly becomes apparent that a central concern underwriting the practical research is how difference is compounded by various agencies of the criminal justice system. These chapters cover a range of topics that include: women in prison, white collar crime, homelessness, Aboriginal Australia, depositionmaking for delinquent girls, homeless mothers and adolescent fear of crime. Underlying each essay is a concern with due process and the distribution of rights. Thus, Rick Sarre's article on "Aboriginal Australia" concludes that "Justice cannot exist in Australia unless there is justice for all" (212). An exception to the, perhaps inevitable, empirical concern with measurable fairness is the contribution of Harry, Davis and Burke entitled the "Victimization of Homeless Youth: Public and Private Regimes of Control". Demonstrating an impressive collection of theoretical and empirical analysis, this essay explores the difficulties faced by homeless youth in light of state and other forms of social control. Using theory from Foucault (1979), along with critical race scholars (hooks, 1990) the authors explore the increased vulnerability of certain homeless youth to the police and to each other. By combining images of the "margin" and location, with three data sets of different homeless youth, Harry, Davis and Burke are able to criticise the uneven distribution of "power and authority" in the societies under examination, while also providing more general critique of power itself.As the essays in this collection demonstrate, the permutations and combinations of oppression vary across nations and peoples, yet inequality remains constantly configured by race, gender and class. As the series editors claim in their introduction, "The subject matter of this anthology -- race, gender, and class -- is a critical one for criminology." Each chapter acknowledges that these elements are critical -- that is, urgent, significant and necessary for criminology. They also propose that they are critical in that they constitute means by which to critique, analyse and demystify criminology. Yet, for this second meaning of "critical" to occur, these terms must themselves be clarified. In other words, what is meant by "race"?. Is it biological, cultural, national (Crib, 1987; [Mann], 1993)? Why use "gender" and not "sex"? Is it because "gender" is perceived to be constructed, while sex is determined (Butler, 1990)? Is "class" a category of economics, or of taste (Willis, 1977, Bourdieu, 1984)? Clearly, each category is not self evident, but rather is constituted by a collection of symbolic and practical forces which remain concealed while theory is ungrounded.

AB  - This study examined prevalence of sexual risks among homeless adolescents & described factors associated with those risks. Community-based outreach methods were used successfully to access this difficult-to-reach population. The sample included 203 homeless youth aged 15-22 recruited from community sites. Questionnaire items addressed demographics, sexual behaviors, alcohol/drug use, STI history & testing, & pregnancy history. In cross-sectional analysis, 58.7% of males & 75.6% of females reported recent sexual intercourse. Of those, one third of males & half of the females used no barrier method with at least one partner. Both gender (female) & race/ethnicity (non-Black) were associated with having intercourse without a barrier contraceptive method. Over one-fifth reported a history of "survival sex" or receiving money, drugs, clothing, shelter, or food for sex. These results show disturbingly high rates of a number of sexual risks, reinforcing the need for targeted interventions with this highly vulnerable population. 2 Tables, 46 References.

AB  - Limited research has addressed reunification of runaway youths with their families following an emergency shelter stay; however, recent studies have shown that those who reunify with their families following a shelter stay have more positive outcomes than those relocated to other residences. This study evaluated differences between two samples of runaway youth utilizing youth emergency shelters in New York (n = 155) and Texas (n = 195) and identified factors associated with reunification among these two groups of adolescents. Less than half (43.7%) of the youths were reunited with their families. Among New York runaway youths, those who had lived primarily with someone other than a parent before shelter admission, were physically abused, or neglected were less likely to return home. Among youths admitted to emergency shelter services in Texas, those with longer shelter stays, living primarily with someone other than a parent before shelter admission, or being pregnant or a parent were less likely to reunify. This study provides valuable information concerning family reunification following shelter service use; however, additional research is needed to delineate youth, family, and shelter system factors that distinguish successful from unsuccessful reunification over an extended period of time.

We searched eight databases, and 21 articles fit the inclusion criteria and represented four methodologies: qualitative (n = 7, 33.3%), survey and secondary data analysis (n = 8, 38.1%), quantitative (n = 4, 19.1%), and mixed-method (n = 2, 9.5%) designs. Studies indicate that youth experiencing homelessness rely on informal social networks for survival, and that spirituality, mental health, and creativity are associated with enhanced coping. More experimental and intervention studies are necessary to support evidence-based resilience practices. Additionally, researchers need to exercise more self-awareness about how stereotypical pejorative paradigms may constrain innovative, strengths-based scholarship.

Most youths experienced oral, anal, or vaginal sex with opposite-sex partners (84%), began to engage in these activities at a relatively young age (mean age = 12.9 years), & used condoms inconsistently or not at all (56%). Among sexually active youths, males initiated heterosexual activity at a significantly earlier age than females, reported more opposite-sex partners, & had a higher prevalence rate of trading sex for money or drugs. These findings indicate specific areas for targeting AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) prevention programs for runaway youth. 3 Tables, 33 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Inadequate housing and homelessness among families represent a substantial challenge for child and adolescent well-being. Child welfare services confront housing that threatens placement into foster care with little resources and evidence to guide practice. The present study provides the first rigorous test of the Family Unification Program (FUP) – a federal program that offers housing subsidies for inadequately housed families under investigation for child maltreatment. A randomized controlled trial assesses program impact on foster care placement and costs. The experiment referred intact child welfare-involved families whose inadequate housing threatened foster placement in Chicago, IL to FUP plus housing advocacy (n = 89 families with 257 children) or housing advocacy alone (n = 89 families with 257 children). Families were referred from 2011 to 2013, and administrative data recorded dates and costs of foster placements over a 3-year follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses suggested families randomly assigned for FUP exhibited slower increases in rates of foster placement following housing intervention compared with families referred for housing advocacy alone. The program generates average savings of nearly $500 per family per year to the foster care system. Housing subsidies provide the foster care system small but significant benefits for keeping homeless families together. Findings inform the design of a coordinated child welfare response to housing insecurity.

AB  - Between 5–9% of American adolescents experience 1+ episode of independent homelessness. Although multiple stressors have consistently been shown to precede runaway behavior, sampling homeless populations fails to capture variation between juveniles who run/do not run. This research uses Waves I and II of the Add Health public use data to examine conditions likely to result in a first-time run among males vs. females. Specifically, we argue that strains/negative emotion derived from Agnew’s general strain theory and social controls derived from Hirschi’s social bond theory will act as positive and negative motivations, respectively, to predict first-time runs. We find significant, main effects on running for multiple strain and control measures. However, results of our integrated models suggest that, while composite strain and depression increase the odds of running across gender, composite social control is associated with lower odds of running for females only. This finding underscores prior research suggesting that social bonds may have a stronger protective impact on females considering a first-time run.

AB  - The handling of status offenders is reviewed in the context of the historical development of juvenile justice in this country. Discrepancies between the legal code and the actual practice are noted and discussed in the light of present tendencies and likely developments concerning status offenders. On the basis of a nationally representative sample of 1467 juvenile offenders a procedure is developed to estimate the actual number of status offenders committed to public correctional facilities in the nation as a whole and in the 48 contiguous states. These estimates are correlated with a battery of socio-demographic factors. The analysis suggests that the phenomenon of status offenders is mainly a problem of the modern way of life characterized by urbanization, industrialization, and affluence. Some policy recommendations are the natural result of the present analysis.The noble intention of the justice system to exempt minors from the full force of criminal law ironically has resulted in one of the worst legal situations on record (Platt, 1969; Mattick and Aikman, 1969; Sarri, 1974). In 1899 Illinois became the first state to enact a juvenile court act, and within thirty years all but two states had followed suit by drafting special juvenile statutes designed to eliminate formal procedures and stigmatizing labels for minors and to emphasize individual treatment on the basis of parens patriae ideologies. Since the juvenile justice system was intended strictly for the protection and well-being of the youth, neither procedural guidelines nor jurisdictional boundaries were thought necessary for inclusion in juvenile statutes (Levin and Sarri, 1974). The lack of such regulations as well as extensive misconceptions of the goals of the reformers have resulted in a most tragic overreach by the juvenile justice system: the presumed or actual possession of jurisdiction over status offenders (Lemert, 1970). A status offender is commonly defined as a minor who engages in conduct which would not result in a criminal charge if committed by an adult. Typical examples of such conduct are "truancy", "running away", "using profanity", "growing up in idleness", and "incorrigibility". These examples make clear that status offenses refer to both violation of specific ordinances and to general character or personality shortcomings and disorders. The indiscriminate handling of status offenders thus not only offends our sense of justice but also invites serious questioning of the efficacy of the present approach to cope with status offenders. In short, an institution designed to protect the most vulnerable population -- the nation's youth, that is -- has turned into a formal procedure by the system in which "the child is least helped and most abused" (Orlando, 1975). The failure to distinguish between status offenses and violations of penal laws by minors has resulted in jammed pretrial detention centers, inadequate and perfunctory court processing, and oversized correctional facilities crowded with status offenders and serious delinquents (including murderers) together. Thus immeasurable damage is inflicted upon youth at an absolutely forbidding cost to society at large. For these reasons the handling of status offenders should be removed from the juvenile justice system and be entrusted to a special service organization which does not have judicial power over its clients. Recent Supreme Court decisions have begun to move in this direction,1 but few states thus far have successfully incorporated this development into the juvenile statutes, and no state has fully implemented the rulings issued by the highest court in this land.In this paper an attempt is made (1) to review the statutory distinctions and disposition differences concerning status offenders and juvenile delinquents, (2) to estimate the number of detained status offenders as a percentage of all the youth committed to public correctional facilities,2 and (3) to examine some structural correlates of the forty-eight contiguous states which might explain the differences in the proportion of status offenders detained in public correctional facilities.

A total of 149 subjects (34 males and 115 females) between the ages of 12 and 16 were administered the Reading section of the High School Personality Questionnaire. Demography data were obtained from each subject's intake interview form. A stepwise multiple discrimination analysis resulted in the selection of 8 variables that discriminate between first-time and recidivist runaways. The 8 discriminant variables characterized the recidivist runaway as an urban, Caucasian youth who has had previous contact with an agency, has stayed at the center an average of 13.6 days, has lower general intelligence, is less objective and less self-sufficient, and is at risk of becoming psychotic or delinquent.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare young people seeking homeless services in two distinct geographic locations (Austin, Texas and St. Louis, Missouri). To determine differences between the two populations, the study used a guiding conceptual model of social estrangement that included four domains: institutional disaffiliation, psychological dysfunction, human capital, and identification with homeless culture. A sample of homeless youth (N = 96; 46 from St. Louis, 50 from Austin) were recruited through youth-serving agencies. Findings indicate two unique samples of street-involved youth in regards to affiliation with formal institutions, family support, and informal peer networks, suggesting distinct service needs.

AB  - This study examines the drivers for and consequences of internal migration to household food security in Uganda. Based on the Ugandan National Panel Surveys conducted between 2010/11 and 2015/16, we estimate differences in food energy adequacy of households receiving internal migrants from elsewhere. Besides food energy consumption, this study applies household food consumption score (FCS) and looks at vulnerability in terms of household’s expenditures on food. This enables to explore (a) the extent to which food insecurity is driving internal migration, and (b) whether remittances can reduce food security of the remitter. We find that households are usually worse-off when migrants join the receiving family. This seems a departure from previous studies that tend to find welfare gains to internal migration, mostly due to changes in expenditures or dietary consumption without considering any thresholds for achieving food security. Based on these findings and responding to rising youth employment challenges associated with rapidly growing urban slums in Uganda, policies that simultaneously support employment creation in both urban and rural areas are urgently needed to enable better steering of the flow of voluntary migration and to help ensuring food security.

AB  - The violent experiences of youth after becoming homeless are examined, based on interviews with 50 homeless young people in Melbourne, Australia. Patterns of violent victimization were found to differ markedly by gender: eg, offenders were virtually all male. Other gender differences are related to the sources & locations of violence & the nature of the relationship & interactions between the victim & the offender. Gender differences in talking about violent experiences are also discussed.

AB  - Services for homeless youth traditionally provided shelter and nourishment but do little to break the cycle of homelessness. A more comprehensive approach to serve homeless youth is the drop-in center model that provides safe and easy-to-find facilities within communities to bridge the gap between the streets and transitional/permanent housing. Research describing homeless youth who utilize drop-in centers is lacking. This study examines characteristics/ preferences of 96 homeless adolescents attending one of two drop-in centers in Southern California. Homeless youth reported high prevalence of risk behaviors regardless of the center of attendance. Furthermore, our analyses revealed significant differences related to demographics, sexual risk behaviors, and substance use between homeless youth at the two drop-in centers. These findings illuminate the specific characteristics and preferences of homeless youth who attend drop-in centers and can be used to inform providers, advocates, and policy makers.

AB  - Historically, insufficient resources and assistance have been provided to young people leaving state care. Care leavers have been found to experience significant health, social and educational deficits including homelessness, disproportionate involvement in juvenile crime and prostitution, poor social supports and early parenthood. This paper compares the UK and Australian debates around improving outcomes for care leavers. Whilst there are some minor differences in the respective legislative frameworks and responses, the similarities are far greater. Both countries have failed to provide the range of in-care, transitional and post-care supports and services required to ensure improved outcomes for care leavers. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - People experiencing homelessness are particularly vulnerable to experiencing stressful life events (SLEs) at some point in their lives; these SLEs are crucial for understanding the etiology and maintenance of homelessness. This study analyses the differences between men and women experiencing homelessness in the suffering of SLEs throughout their lives (childhood, adolescence, and adulthood). The sample consisted of a group of 293 people experiencing homelessness in Madrid (Spain): 156 men and 137 women. The results suggest that the number and type of SLEs experienced by men and women are different. In general, women experiencing homelessness suffer more SLEs than men in all periods of their lives. The differences in the level of sexual violence in childhood, sexual abuse in adulthood, and abuse by a spouse or partner are particularly striking. However, men experiencing homelessness score significantly higher than women for alcohol abuse, police complaints, arrest, and imprisonment throughout their lives. These findings have significant implications for the design of interventions and social policies that should be tailored to the specific needs of men and women who are homeless.

AB  - Runaway youth report a broader range and higher severity of substance-related, mental health and family problems relative to non-runaway youth. Most studies to date have collected self-report data on the family and social history; virtually no research has examined treatment effectiveness with this population. This study is a treatment development project in which 124 runaway youth were randomly assigned to (1) ecologically based family therapy (EBFT) or (2) service as usual (SAU) through a shelter. Youth completed an intake, posttreatment, 6 and 12 months follow-up assessment. Youth assigned to EBFT reported greater reductions in overall substance abuse compared to youth assigned to SAU while other problem areas improved in both conditions. Findings suggest that EBFT is an efficacious intervention for this relatively severe population of youth. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Given high levels of health and psychological costs associated with the family disruption of homelessness, identifying predictors of runaway and homeless episodes is an important goal. The current study followed 179 substance abusing, shelter-recruited adolescents who participated in a randomized clinical trial. Predictors of runaway and homeless episodes were examined over a two year period. Results from the hierarchical linear modeling analysis showed that family cohesion and substance use, but not family conflict or depressive symptoms, delinquency, or school enrollment predicted future runaway and homeless episodes. Findings suggest that increasing family support, care and connection and reducing substance use are important targets of intervention efforts in preventing future runaway and homeless episodes amongst a high risk sample of adolescents.

AB  - High level of mental health problems are a critical concern among youth experiencing or at-risk of homelessness. Using data from a randomized controlled trial on Housing First in Canada, this study examined the risk factors and protective resources associated with mental health recovery among 215 homeless youth with mental illness at baseline and at a 24-month follow-up. At study entry, higher levels of recovery were associated with a lower number of adverse childhood experiences, less frequent presence of mental health symptoms, higher level of satisfaction with social relationships, and a higher level of psychological integration at baseline. At 24-months, a lower frequency of experiencing mental health symptoms and a higher level of psychological integration were associated with a higher level of recovery. The study’s findings highlight the importance of protective resources, notably having supportive social relationships and a sense of belonging in the community as contributors to mental health recovery

AB  - Using a large survey of Czech high school students (n = 1103), aged 15-20 years, this paper explores youth prejudice to a wide range of minority groups (n = 21) where family, school, and community contexts are taken into account. General Structural Equation Models are used to explore the determinants of prejudice for 21 minorities using a comparative explanatory framework where the focus is gender differences in prejudice to minorities are examined using three social theories: Social Dominance Theory (SDT), the Theory of Gendered Prejudice (TGP), and Gender Role Beliefs (GRB). This research shows that gender plays a strong role in expressing prejudiced attitudes where females express (a) less prejudiced attitudes toward the Roma, black Africans, Gays and those with mental or physical disabilities, and (b) more prejudiced attitudes towards the homeless, Vietnamese, Muslims, and lesbians. This gendered pattern is explained in terms of insights from SDT, TGP, and GRB.

Undergraduate students interviewed clients at diverse social service agencies in Los Angeles that include homeless shelters, child welfare organizations, domestic violence organizations, LGBTQIA youth‐oriented agencies, nonprofits serving older adults, schools, and organizations serving low‐income families. Students used the information gathered from the interviews to visually map their clients' environmental and structural barriers, as well as their pathways to service. The research team then analyzed the students' visual maps to create one cohesive, complex, and multilayered visual map representing clients' overall barriers and pathways to social services in Los Angeles.

The population of M runaways evidenced dramatically higher rates of sexual & physical abuse than did randomly sampled populations in previous studies. Sexually abused & nonsexually abused M runaways shared characteristics noted in the literature as common to runaways: problem families, high rates of delinquency, depression, tension, low self-image, & history of physical abuse. Sexually abused M runaways differed from their nonabused counterparts in their reactions to their runaway event, responding in highly avoidant patterns coupled with extreme withdrawal from all types of interpersonal relationships. These differences are explained as consistent with known sequelae of sexual abuse, & the implications for treatment by runaway shelters, & for further research, are suggested. 6 Tables, 59 References.

AB  - This article sets out to describe and comparatively identify the possible economic, institutional and cultural factors that take part in the process of transition to adulthood, with particular emphasis on factors that explain why Young people in Spain leave the parental home late in life. To do this, a number of indicators have been selected and made up using data from different international statistical sources. The results obtained suggest that in the welfare regimes of Southern Europe, and particularly in Spain, factors such as scarce emancipation policies, the cross-generational solidarity, the home-ownership culture, Young people's economic situation and job insecurity, together with the inflexibility and the costly housing market have all created a culture of parental dependence as a strategy for accumulating capital and for coping with risks in a precarious environment exemplified by the social exclusion and poverty. The analysis has highlighted gender differences in the process of transition to adulthood. The combined analysis of all these factors has enabled a more in-depth understanding of the possible causes of the delay in the process of leaving the parental home experienced by the Spanish Young people in a comparative perspective.

AB  - Educational failure is one of the costliest and most visible problems associated with ghetto poverty. We explore whether housing assistance that helps low-income families move to better neighborhoods can also improve access good schools. Research on the Gautreaux housing desegregation program indicated significant, long-term educational benefits, yet results from the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment showed no measurable impacts school outcomes for the experimental group. We use interviews and ethnographic fieldwork to explore this puzzle. Most MTO families did not relocate to communities with substantially better schools, and those who did often moved again after a few years. Where parents had meaningful school choices, these were typically driven by poor information obtained from insular social networks or by cultural logic centered on avoiding ghetto-type school insecurity and disorder, not garnering academic opportunity. Those factors may not shift if poor families with less educated parents are served by a relocation-only strategy. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This article addresses controversy over gender differences in risk and protective factors for late-adolescence assaults. A secondary analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort considered 2,552 youth aged 12 or 13 in the first survey wave. Comparison of girls and boys revealed, as expected, boys had higher levels of risk factors: early delinquency, gang involvement, and hopelessness. Girls were higher in the protective factors, parental monitoring, and school and religious ties; but boys were higher in parental support and work involvement. Negative binomial regression showed that gang exposure and hopelessness explained assaults, regardless of gender. For girls, early runaway behavior and work activity were positively, and parental monitoring was negatively, related to assaults. Unexpectedly, boys with high parental support were more assaultive than others. Prevention requires addressing negative contexts for all youth, but for girls, programs also must address conditions promoting their running away.

AB  - Undoubtedly, runaway and homeless youth (RHY) are one of the most vulnerable, yet underserved groups in our country. Well-meaning advocates have developed programs and services in an attempt to remedy this, yet there is little evidence of their effectiveness. Moreover, according to the research literature, a low utilization rate of current services by youth is a major concern. From a constructivist theoretical position, this study posits that the missing element is youth voice and the researcher hired formerly homeless youth to conduct the analysis of focus group data gathered from RHY who were participating in a range of services funded by the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. By employing participatory action research (PAR) methods, this study privileges youth voice and asks two research questions; 1) what are current program models doing right with regards to RHY services, and 2) what can be learned by employing youth analysts in research. Findings indicate that how services are offered is as important as what services are offered. Additionally, by privileging youth and providing meaningful participation, youth are exceptionally capable to develop and evaluate services, programs and policy. Youth workers must continue to privilege youth voice if they hope to effect change in the lives of young people. If not, services will continue to play a key role in keeping RHY as one of the most marginalized groups in our society.

AB  - Surveillance data suggests that use of ecstasy in the U.S. is predominantly among white adolescent & young adults. To investigate ecstasy use among substance users in New York City we added questions to ongoing efforts to recruit heroin & cocaine users. Of 715 participants recruited, 58.3% were injection dug users (IDUs). The median age was 32 (range 17-64), 76.4% were male, 49.0% were currently homeless, 62.4% were Hispanic, 27.3% were black, & 34.5% were born outside the United States. Overall, 23.4% used ecstasy in their lifetime & 11.9% had used in the last-6 months. In multivariate logistic regression, correlates of lifetime ecstasy use included younger age, being born in the U.S., & current homelessness. We observed a significant interaction between injection drug use & race where, compared to black non-IDUs, Hispanic non-IDUs, & white IDUs were significantly more likely to have a history of lifetime ecstasy use while black IDUs were significantly less likely. These findings are limited to persons who use other drugs, but suggest that further investigation of ecstasy use in minority populations is warranted. Tables, References.

AB  - Experiencing sexual victimization prior to becoming homeless is common among homeless youth and is associated with increased HIV risk behavior. This study examined mediating variables that underlie this association, adding to the understanding of gender differences in these paths. Participants were homeless youth in Los Angeles recruited through service access centers who completed a computerized self-administered interview in English or Spanish using an iPad. Findings indicate a high presence of sexual victimization across both genders. Female participants experienced posttraumatic stress disorder and subsequent engagement with exchange sex, whereas male participants were primarily involved in substance use risk pathways. Results indicate paths in the association between sexual victimization and HIV risk behavior differ between male and female homeless youth. Gender-specific, mental-health-informed interventions targeting sexual risk reduction are warranted.

AB  -  Runaway youths represent a neglected clinical group, and few studies have examined ethnicity differences within this population. Substance use, family functioning and related problem behaviors were examined in a sample of Hispanic and Anglo runaway youths with substance abuse diagnoses (N = 145). Youths, aged 12-17, were recruited from two urban, southwestern runaway shelters. Within single-parent families, Anglo youths reported more marijuana use, and, regardless of family constitution, reported more tobacco use than did Hispanic youths. Overall, Anglo youths reported more externalizing problems and more conflict tactics used in resolving disagreements with their primary caretaker while Hispanic youths reported higher depression and familism scores. Given the differences found between Hispanic and Anglo youths, the findings argue that culturally sensitive interventions for runaway youths and families are warranted.

AB  - The purpose of this descriptive exploratory research was to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of a values-based developmental curriculum as compared to a behavioral point system used in a short-term shelter for runaway youth. It was anticipated that if differences were indeed found that the values-based developmental curriculum would prove to be more effective, efficient, and satisfying. Effectiveness was measured by whether youth went home to live with a parent after their shelter stay, the number of incidents across shift times, whether youth were living with a parent at the 180 day follow-up, and whether youth returned to the shelter during the time period under evaluation. A sample of convenience was used. Two distinct periods of time were identified within each curriculum time frame. Data were gathered from a short-term community-based shelter for youth in the southeastern United States. Secondary data sources were used such as existing agency databases and spreadsheets. Participants in this study included 207 youth between the ages of 8 and 17 who had stayed at the shelter at least one day. One hundred four of those youth stayed at the shelter during the 1997 time period and 103 stayed at the shelter during the 1999 time period. The majority of youth (62%) were from the county where the shelter was located. Chi-square tests were performed to determine significant differences between curriculums. The results of these tests indicated that there is no statistically significant difference between the values-based developmental curriculum and the behavioral point system on the variables of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. One exception to this was a statistically significant difference between the number of night shift incidents.

AB  - Runaway and homeless youth often have a constellation of background behavioral, emotional, and familial problems that contribute to stress and maladaptive behaviors, which, in turn, can lead to self-harming and suicidal behaviors. The current study examined the roles of stress and maladaptive behaviors as mediators between demographic and psychosocial background characteristics and self-injurious outcomes through the lens of the stress process paradigm. The model was tested in a sample of runaway and homeless youth from Los Angeles County (N = 474, age 12-24, 41 % female, 17 % White, 32.5 % African American, 21.5 % Hispanic/Latino). Background variables (gender, age, sexual minority status, parental drug use history, and emotional distress) predicted hypothesized mediators of maladaptive behaviors and recent stress. In turn, it was hypothesized that the mediators would predict self-harming behaviors and suicide attempts in the last 3 months. Females and LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) youth were more likely to have self-harmed and attempted suicide; younger participants reported more self-harming. The mediating constructs were associated more highly with self-harming than suicide attempts bivariately, although differences were modest. Maladaptive behaviors and recent stress were significant predictors of self-harm, whereas only recent stress was a significant predictor of suicide attempts. All background factors were significant predictors of recent stress. Older age, a history of parental drug use, and greater emotional distress predicted problem drug use. Males, younger participants, and participants with emotional distress reported more delinquent behaviors. Significant indirect effects on self-harming behaviors were mediated through stress and maladaptive behaviors. The hypothesized paradigm was useful in explaining the associations among background factors and self-injurious outcomes and the influence of mediating factors on these associations.

AB  - Quantitative studies in crime and criminal justice are concerned with empirically measuring, capturing, or nullifying the "casual relationships" or "differencing effects" of class, race, or gender on crime, delinquency, violence, law enforcement, adjudication, sentencing, and punishment. In the tradition of "functionalism," crime and crime control are viewed as indexes of misconduct. Typically, class, race, and/or gender become the "independent" variables and crime and crime control become the "dependent" variables. In the tradition of "positivist" social science, these studies normally engage large data sets involving samples that number into the three or four digits. Data, in the case of crime, is generally gathered through responses to "self-reported" questionnaires, that strive to represent as best as possible the real world breakdowns or population demographics. In the case of the administration of criminal justice, data stems mostly from he FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, the U.S. Department of Justice, and other governmental documents produced locally or at the state level. Inevitably, there are usually some limitations that restrict generalization such as under or over representation of particular socio-economic group/s.For the purposes of this presentation, I turned to the May (2000) issue of Criminology, the official quarterly publication of the American Society of Criminology (ASC), and discovered that five out of the ten articles dealt with class, race, and/or gender. Four of those were quantitative studies: "Minority Threat and Police Brutality: Determinants of Civil Rights Complaints in U.S. Municipalities"; "Gender, Structural Disadvantage, and Urban Crime: Do Macrosocial Variables also Explain Female Offending Rates?"; "Perceived Sanction Threats, Gender, and Crime: A Test and Elaboration of Power-Control Theory"; and "The Myth of Social Class and Crime Revisited: An Examination of Class and Adult Criminality." It is interesting to note, though each of these studies was primarily concerned with race, or gender, or class, that three of them addressed all three variables, and the fourth addressed two out of the three. In order to convey the complexity and sophistication of these and other quantitative studies, permit me to elaborate a bit more from one of these articles. In this way, I hope to illustrate how thematically there is an emerging consensus around the importance of class, race, and gender, even among quantitative researchers whose studies have tended to nullify the importance of these variables. For example, in "The Myth of Social Class and Crime Revisited," [Dunaway, R.G] et al. (2000:589) concluded from a sample of 555 adults living in a large, midwestern city that "regardless of how class or crime were measured, social class exerted little direct influence on adult criminality in the general population." Nevertheless, in their analysis, the authors revealed a number of caveats about their findings, such as: "The lack of both significant class effects and any race effects in our general crime scale may suggest a possible interaction effect between social class and race" (Ibid:607).The objectives in Race, Gender, and Class in Criminology are explicitly to investigate the various intersections of class, race, and gender, to explore \how these relations or configurations are more than the sum of their parts, and to examine how these intersections may structure criminal opportunities and shape criminal behavior. Each of the contributions whether addressing theory or practice, do so from the mutual vantage points of class, race, and gender. At the same time, a variety of theoretical perspectives from critical criminology, including neo-Marxism, feminism, left realism, postmodernism, peacemaking, and news making, are heard from. Each of these contributions tries to capture the way that its particular theoretical framework has or could look at these intersections in relationship to the production of crime and crime control. Thus, all kinds of relationships are discussed including: "structured choices," "life histories," "unequal power," "layers of domination," "psychoanalytic semiotics," "mass mediations," "fluid social constructs," "axes of differences," and "interpenetrating effects." Contributors to this volume come from the USA, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. A sampling of the chapter titles from the "applications" section of Race, Gender, and Class in Criminology reads: "White Collar Crime and the Class-Race-Gender Construct"; "Aboriginal Australia: Current Criminological Themes"; "Controlling Homeless Mothers: The Surveillance of Women in a Homeless Shelter"; and "Adolescence and the Socialization of Gendered Fear."

AB  - Teenage runaways were compared to teenage nonrunaways concerning their views on parenting behaviors. In ratings of reasons for running away, the runaways emphasized typical teenage issues such as differences in values from parents and rebellion. On the other hand, nonrunaways gave highest ratings to more dramatic issues such as parental abuse and drug use. Runaways were less likely to want to have children than nonrunaways and, if they did have children, runaways anticipated being very different with their children than their parents had been with them (e.g., more involved and open). Nonrunaways generally expected to be about the same as their parents had been. Suggestions for treatment, based on the findings, are offered.

Implications for a particular segment of at-risk adolescents -- those in foster care residential group homes -- the majority of whom (at least in large urban centers) are African American or Latino are then discussed. These young people bear a disproportionate burden of societal problems, eg, unintended pregnancy & childbearing, academic underachievement & dropout, substance abuse, &, ultimately, homelessness & more individually & socially costly forms of dependency (criminal justice, welfare, or mental health systems). It is postulated that their social maladaptation is reflective of identity disturbances created by the negative images of African Americans & Latinos perpetuated by the dominant society & unfiltered by optimal parental racial socialization. 51 References.

AB  - A study focusing on diff's in adjustment of boys & girls within the context of an investigation of the effects of early separation from parents on adolescents of the George Junior Republic in Freeville, NY. Policies & program at the Republic are detailed. The sample consisted of the records of 107 consecutive discharges from the Republic (N = 72 boys & 35 girls). To evaluate the adolescent's interaction in the group setting as to compliance or rebellion, certain measures of adjustment or maladjustment were selected: (1) runaway score, (2) court offense score, (3) highest bank account, (4) gov position score, (5) general adjustment rating, & (6) Sigma Gamma (an honorary society for excellent citizenship). The Md test was used to compare 1 group with another. The dividing point between class-intervals nearest the calculated Md is used to determine the f'cies above & below the Md. Yates' correction is used throughout. The differential sex effects of separation in the various age groups were calculated by way of second-order diff's. Results showed that 'the separated boys, & esp those separated early in life, demonstrated poorer adjustment than the nonseparated according to the criteria most related to active nonconformity standards - Runaway Score & Court Offense Record.' There are no essential diff's between the 2 groups with regard to the criteria of Bank Account & Gov Position Score, the achievement-oriented criteria. The nonseparated boys are more conforming than the separated ones on the General Adjustment Rating. The separated girls conform to standards to a greater extent than the nonseparated on the achievement-oriented criteria. The girls separated in the first 3 yrs run away less than those not separated. There are no diff's on Court Offenses Score. On the General Adjustment Rating the separated girls tend to conform more than the nonseparated. The second order sex diff's reveal that separation is related to better adjustment for the girls than for the boys on Runaway Score, Court Offense Score & General Adjustment Rating. The same sex diff's are present for those separated in the first 3 or 5 yrs for Runaway Score & Court Offense Score & in the first 5 yrs for General Adjustment Rating. 'Thus for boys separation is related to poor adjustment, but for girls it is related to better adjustment.' The general effects of separation upon children is discussed. E. Weiman.

AB  - Most of what we know about sexual abuse comes from efforts to examine female children victimized by men. Although some researchers have identified similarities between male & female victims of sexual abuse, few studies have examined gender-specific factors associated with sexual health practices among homeless adolescents. The aim of this study was to explore how gender and history of sexual abuse influence cognitive-perceptual & behavioral factors associated with sexual health practices of homeless adolescents. This study was a secondary analysis of data collected for a cross-sectional study of the sexual health practices of homeless adolescents. The sample consisted of 414 youths (104 males who reported sexual abuse & 124 who did not; & 95 females who reported sexual abuse & 75 who did not; 16 did not provide these data). Homeless adolescent females with a history of sexual abuse scored higher (indicating a shorter perspective) on a measure of future time perspective than females with no sexual abuse. Males who reported no sexual abuse scored higher than abused females on perceived health status & higher than abused males on assertive communication. With respect to perceived health status, males who reported no sexual abuse scored significantly higher than females who reported sexual abuse (p = .04). Males with no sexual abuse had significantly higher assertive communication scores than did males who had experienced sexual abuse (p = .015). We found that male & female abuse victims differ in terms of their cognitive-perceptual & behavioral factors associated with sexual health practices. Early identification of those who have been abused is critical so that interventions can be developed. Effective short-term interventions are needed for the adolescent victims of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA), particularly those who are homeless & prone to further sexual victimization.

AB  - The current analysis examined whether male & female street youth in a midsized Brazilian city differed in their family circumstances & day-to-day functioning on the street. The opportunity sample consisted of 33 male (mean age 14.3, range 10-17 years) & 33 female (mean age 14.6, range 11-18 years) street youth who participated in a sentence completion task & structured interview examining family experiences & ability to meet daily needs on the street. Consistent with the cultural hypothesis, girls described more negative family backgrounds than boys (eg, they were more likely to have left home because of conflict or abuse, & reported more negative relationships with their parents). However, girls' functioning on the street was similar to, & in some cases more positive then, that of boys (eg, fewer girls reported police violence & begging to earn money). The few gender differences that emerged in this study offer little support for the cultural hypothesis. The findings make sense if local factors, such as services available for male & female youth & public response to street youth, are considered. It appears that street youth differ in their experiences depending on local circumstances, highlighting the need for caution in generalizing about the situation of street youth in different countries. 2 Tables, 3 Figures, 37 References.

AB  - Purpose We examined the correlates and health implications of household food insecurity among Hispanic/Latino youth (aged 8–16 years), a high food insecurity–risk population. Methods Using the Hispanic Community Children's Health/Study of Latino Youth (n = 1,362) and bivariate and multivariate analyses, we examined the correlates of household and child food insecurity and very low food security. We assessed the influence of four sets of risk/protective factors-child demographic, acculturation, socioeconomic, and family/social support. We then examined associations between food insecurity and four health indicators-body mass index, diet quality, depression, and anxiety-and used modification effects to assess whether these associations differed by sex, age, household income, parent nativity, and acculturative stress levels. Results We found high rates of food insecurity: 42% of Hispanic/Latino youth experienced household food insecurity and 33% child food insecurity. Moreover, 10% lived in a very low food secure household. Compared with their food secure peers, Hispanic/Latino youth in food insecure households experienced greater parent/child acculturative and economic stress and weakened family support systems. Associations of food insecurity with health outcomes varied by sex, age, household income, parent nativity, and child acculturative stress levels. Conclusions Food insecurity is highly prevalent among Hispanic/Latino youth and has detrimental health implications, especially for girls, older youth, and youth experiencing acculturative stress. Reducing food insecurity and improving health among Hispanic/Latino youth will likely require comprehensive policies that address their multiple migration, familial, and economic stressors.

AB  - Tehran, 1934. Introducing his newest book, Mental Diseases, Dr. Muhammad-[ayin ]Ali Tutiya hits a raw nerve. Iran's capital is abuzz with news about [ayin ]Ali Asghar Borujerdi. Earlier on that year, the man soon dubbed Asghar Qatel (the murderer) confessed to having had sexual intercourse and subsequently killed thirty-three adolescent boys. Born in 1893 in the Western Iranian town of Borujerd, at the age of eight he left with his mother and siblings for Karbala, Iraq. Six years later, he moved on to Baghdad, and began to sexually abuse adolescents. Eventually, he began to murder them, according to his initial testimony in order to trick the police that were observing him. In 1933, after having taken twenty-five lives, he only escaped Baghdad and arrest by the skin of his teeth. Arriving in Tehran, he worked as porter and vegetable-seller, and took up residence in Bagh-e Ferdous, a neighborhood in Tehran's poor popular south. He carried on with his deeds, killing eight boys, most of them homeless vagrants. The first bodies, heads severed, were found on 31 December 1933. Borujerdi was arrested once and released for lack of evidence, but in early March of 1934, the police detained him again, and this time he confessed. He was tried, convicted, and, after an unsuccessful appeal, was hung in front of an immense crowd in Tehran's Sepah Square on 26 June. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This study illuminates aspects of social life within agencies designed to house homeless adolescents through research conducted at a live-in, emergency youth shelter. The shelter provides physical necessities, safety, life skills, and a "consistent" social environment through its operation as a quasi-total institution. Social life within the shelter is characterized by constant negotiation of the curricular imposition of "structure." External boundaries become more or less permeable as a result of the degrees to which shelter residents and staff challenge or conform to rules meant to define them. Shelter curriculum may be critiqued for treating adolescent homelessness as an individual rather than social problem, where rules simultaneously emphasize the modification of individual behaviors and serve as social control mechanisms. Shelter residents, whose poverty and homelessness are only marginally connected to personal behaviors or choices, mount (at times) conscious opposition to rules sanctioning their personal freedoms and access to the outside world.

AB  - Introduction: Homeless and precariously housed young people are a complex, vulnerable population frequently perceived as being difficult to engage in health and social services. Although unrecognized deficits in cognitive functioning may adversely affect their ability to access assistance and meaningfully participate in programming, few researchers have examined these deficits. The purpose of this study was to examine the extent of global and domain-specific cognitive impairment of street involved young people. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted using intake data from 494 clients (64% male; average age of 21 years) enrolled in a community-based inner city mental health program in Vancouver, Canada. Descriptive statistics were used to examine performance on six cognitive domains for a subsample (N = 44) referred for neuropsychological evaluation and bivariate statistics were used to compare youth who were and were not referred. Results: Cognitive impairment was evident in 80% of referred clients, with the most frequent difficulties involving attention and processing speed. Approximately 51% of clients referred for testing did not have more than a grade ten education and only 5% received government support for those with significant disabilities. Apart from alcohol use disorder, no significant differences were identified on sociodemographic and mental health variables between groups of referred and non-referred clients. Conclusions: Significant cognitive impairment was found in 80% of the young people referred for neuropsychological evaluation. This level of impairment combined with high levels of early school exiting and low levels of government support highlight the need for targeted screening to facilitate early identification and intervention.

AB  - Despite great interest in adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), there has been limited research on racial and ethnic differences in their prevalence. Prior research in the United States suggests that the prevalence of ACEs varies along socioeconomic lines, but it is uncertain whether there are racial/ethnic differences in ACE rates among low-income populations. This study examined the distribution of ACEs in a sample of 1523 low-income women in Wisconsin that received home visiting services. Participants ranging in age from 16 to 50 years were coded into five racial/ethnic groups, including Hispanics and four non-Hispanic groups: blacks, whites, American Indians, and other race. Following measurement conventions, ten dichotomous indicators of child maltreatment and household dysfunction were used to create a composite ACE score. Five other potential childhood adversities were also assessed: food insecurity, homelessness, prolonged parental absence, peer victimization, and violent crime victimization. Results from bivariate and multivariate analyses revealed that, while rates of adversity were high overall, there were significant racial/ethnic differences. Total ACE scores of American Indians were comparable to the ACE scores of non-Hispanic whites, which were significantly higher than the ACE scores of non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics. Whites were more likely than blacks to report any abuse or neglect, and they were more likely than blacks and Hispanics to report any household dysfunction. The results underscore the need to account for socioeconomic differences when making racial/ethnic comparisons. Potential explanations for the observed differences are examined.

AB  - In 1995, Washington State passed the 'Becca Bill', reversing existing law in Washington State and putting the state in conflict with United States law and the United Nations Children's Rights Convention. These laws and convention prioritized voluntary services for runaways and other so-called status offenders -- juveniles committing offenses that would not be considered crimes for adults. But despite the fact that both sides argued in support of protecting the safety and best interests of children, the debate leading to the Becca Bill was highly conflictual. This research argues that models for serving runaway, homeless, and at-risk youth contain an implicit prioritization of two conflicting values -- safety and choice, and that respondent attitudes towards the different models are related to the respondents' own values hierarchies. Comparing the values and attitudes of staff working in youth services in Washington state with those in two adjacent states/provinces with a different configuration of laws related to youth permits examination not only of the relationship between values and attitudes, but also between values and the normative-legal environment. Finally, a comparison of the values and attitudes of staff according to the types of program in which they work offers data regarding the relationship between values and epistemic communities. Despite the efforts of social scientist researchers over the past 50-100 years, debates continue about the exact meaning of 'institution' and 'values', the origins of institutions and values, the parameters around them, and what causes them to change. The challenge is not simply academic, for the very concepts of institutions and values imply entities that have great influence in the daily life of individuals. This research thus provides insight both in the area of policy and that of theory regarding values and institutions. The results of the research show that staff values are related to a combination of personal experience, the technical considerations of the work, and the epistemic communities within which they operate. No correlation of values and attitudes is found with the normative legal environment. Significant differences are found, however, according to the type of agency in which staff work.

AB  - Building on evidence of increasing inequality with the 2008-2009 recession, we asked whether households experienced different financial trajectories through the recession depending on initial income and net worth. Using growth curve models of households headed by young adults in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we compared the relationship between initial income and net worth and the rate of change of income and net worth from 1989 to 2011 among households with income above and below $50,000. We found different patterns of income change and different relationships among income, net worth, and their rates of change between high- and low-income categories. Results suggest initial wealth helped to stabilize income and wealth changes among higher income households, reducing financial insecurity.

AB  - I went home and sat down to write the letter. It took me many drafts over several hours to find a writing voice that didn't sound like that of a bullshitter. The next day I met T in the lunchroom and handed him the promised letter in an unsealed, university letterhead envelope. T took the envelope from me. "Thanks," he said, looking me straight in the eye. T raised the envelope to his lips, licked and sealed it. "I'll give it to my lawyer, " he said. I was surprised - and disappointed - when he didn't read the letter. "I wrote exactly what I think of you, " I said, "no bullshit. " T ran his thumb over the flap to emphasize the seal, and put the envelope in his pocket. "I don't need to read it, " he said, "I trust you. " "Thanks. . . Well. . . Good luck in court. "Who actually lives here? Precise population figures for an inner-city neighbourhood where real estate speculation, rampant gentrification and increasing "houselessness" compete for space are, of course, elusive. Downtown Eastside Vancouver is a "low income" neighbourhood but not a homogenous one. Census Canada imagines there are about 16,000 residents in Downtown Eastside Vancouver. Between 25%-40% are indigenous persons (depending on how the count is conducted, by whom and for what purpose) from aU over Canada - and from elsewhere in North, Central and South America who have been dislocated over the course of years, decades or centuries. The neighbourhood is the historic site of Chinatown and still home to many East Asian Canadians. Another significant category of residents are described as "multi-cultural": people with diverse relationships to East Asian, South Asian, Latin American, Middle Eastern and African heritages. The "other" residents are Caucasian Canadians (of various sorts). Young people of aU races - but disproportionately Indigenous - raised in government foster homes and now "released from care" live here. So do teenage runaways, refugees and asylum seekers from around the world, former patients of institutions for the mentally Ul now "deinstitutionalized," unskilled and semiskilled workers whose labour has been rendered redundant, disabled and chronicaUy ül people. Many suffer with diseases like TB, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis C, syphüis, diabetes and mental Ulness. Their homes are in düapidated rooming houses, or public housing projects, or outside on streets, in parks, alleys and doorways. Buying, using and seUing concoctions of prescription and street drugs structure the everyday lives of some residents, and many women in particular support famüies and habits through street-level prostitution, now called "survival sex work." Epidemiological estimates claim that about 25% of the Downtown Eastside population is made up of heroin and crack cocaine "addicts."I have been continually confronted by questions about "outcomes" in relation to SPR These questions range, depending on who asks - doctors, medical researchers, health care providers, advocates, activists, artists, researchers, colleagues, students or research participants. "Did SPP help participants manage their addictions more positively?" "Did they comply with HIV medication regimes more effectively?" "What policy or program recommendations were produced?" "How was it different from other community theatre projects?" "Was it just another fun thing for researchers that exploited research participants like all other research projects?" "What was tL· point of SPP, anyway?"

AB  - For instance, some sexual behaviors, such as child molestation or rape, are clearly harmful to others, yet society seems unable or unwilling to take action to prevent these behaviors. Other behaviors between consenting adults that per se cause no harm, such as homosexuality, are met with harsh condemnation and discriminatory societal responses. Power differences between people, dependent upon their race, gender, and class, are major factors in how "normal" sexual relationships are expected to be carried out. In fact, much of what we call sexual attraction is based upon certain parties acting dominant/powerful and others acting subordinate/powerless. These learned expectations shape how we are taught sexuality should be practiced.The mass media and criminal justice system in this country often try to give the impression that sexual molestation and incest are quite serious crimes that result in swift, punitive justice. Hidden beneath this deceptive veil is the reality that not only do a significant proportion of young women in our society experience sexual molestation, but the status of the perpetrator and victim has a direct bearing on whether a crime is considered to have occurred or not. For instance, in many large cities young teenage girls (often runaways) work as prostitutes whose "customers" are mostly adult, middle-class men. Many people might see this as a sad reality of contemporary society, but few are concerned enough to do anything to change the conditions -- poverty -- that lead to young girls' prostituting their bodies for survival. Nor does there seem to be much societal concern or condemnation for wealthy men in Western countries who pay for "sex tours" to have access to adolescent women's bodies in the Philippine Islands or Thailand. A monetary exchange where the more wealthy purchase the sexual services of subordinates seemingly makes up for any transgression.

AB  - This paper describes changes in the housing market after the collapse of communism in Central Europe and analyses the current functions and perceptions of the private rental housing in the Czech Republic. It aims to understand why private rental housing is perceived as a sub-optimal housing solution for young adults, whether this affects their family plans, and which policy design could change that. The article uses qualitative research techniques to analyse mental frames, opinions, and attitudes of both potential tenants and landlords towards rental housing. The authors argue that the main problem of rental housing for young tenants is the short-term lease. Lack of mutual trust between tenants and landlords is a main cause of short-term contracts in the private rental segment. The insecurity it produces among young tenants contributes to delayed family formation. A policy tool aiming to overcome that distrust between tenants and private landlords through the involvement of an independent third party as a guarantor of the relationship is discussed.

AB  - Recreational cocaine use spread rapidly in Amsterdam, Netherlands, at the end of the 1970s, particularly as a "party drug" in clubs & discotheques. At the end of the 1980s, the role of cocaine as party drug was largely taken over by ecstasy. In contrast, first cocaine & then crack cocaine increased in popularity among heroin addicts & marginalized street youth, including the homeless & prostitutes. Today, experimental use of crack is also observed among young people from socially deprived neighborhoods, especially among ethnic minorities. Here, drawing mainly on ethnographic studies among these groups, the evolving & diverging patterns of use among trend-setting party youth & their marginalized counterparts are described. Important differences may be observed between groups related to socioeconomic background, the role cocaine plays in their lives, transmission routes, & different operating market mechanisms influenced by drug policy. For party youth, cocaine use mainly serves recreational purposes. In contrast, for problem youth, cocaine, & now especially crack, contribute to multiproblem behavior within the context of their marginalized lifestyles. 5 Tables, 2 Figures, 39 References.

AB  - General strain theory posits that adverse circumstances experienced by youths increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. Broidy and Agnew argue that while the underlying process identified in the general strain model will be applicable to both male and female crime different models of strain may be required to highlight gender differences in the underlying process. Utilizing a "high risk" sample of 400 homeless street youths the study examines how socioeconomic strain in the forms of homelessness, monetary dissatisfaction, and relative deprivation may be differentially linked to property and violent crime depending on gender. The conditioning effects of deviant attitudes, deviant peers, attributions, self- efficacy, and self-esteem are also examined. The results reveal few gender differences in the main effects of the different types of strain on crime. There are, however, gender differences in the way. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Data obtained via participant observation & standardized psychological tests completed by 56 Colombian street children aged 7-16 illustrate that they are functioning with adequate mental health. As a consequence of the children coping well & living without strict parental supervision, they are seen as a challenge to the virtue of family as depicted by the dominant social class. Street children come from poor, matrifocal families where they are raised for early independence in order to function in a subculture of urban poverty, while the dominant class of Spanish patrifocal families raises their children under strict obedience to parental authority, delaying adolescent independence. Cross-cultural comparisons indicate that the street children live as nomadic entertainers in a politically volatile sedentary society; their early independence inadvertently challenges male power in the patriarchal family, an attitude that is made more poignant by the waning power of the state to control its citizenry. It is concluded that adolescence must be defined in a historical & societal context. 24 References. Modified AA

AB  - This article reports results from two focus groups designed to understand perceptions of health and nature among adolescents living in emergency family shelters. Following institutional review board (IRB) approval, the authors conducted one focus group each at two emergency family shelters in a high-density suburb in the southern United States with a total of eight adolescents (ages 13-17; 100% African American; 3 males). The study followed the tenets of interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) in question design, data collection, and analysis. Four themes emerged from the data: (1) you are what you eat (2) healthy food is not always an option (3) physical activity makes you healthy, but it's hard in a shelter and (4) nature is an abstract ideal. The adolescents expressed a desire to lead healthy lives but were stymied by the built environment; they described nature in idyllic terms but rarely reported engaging in outdoor leisure activities. Findings offer preliminary evidence supporting the need to provide adolescents in family shelters with enhanced access to outdoor physical activity opportunities and fresh foods. Results also highlight the importance of future research into how the built environment contributes to physical and mental health disparities among adolescents in high poverty situations such as homelessness.

AB  - To examine the relationship between home-life risk factors & suicide attempts among homeless & runaway street youth, 775 such youth, ages 12-19, recruited from shelters & street locations in Denver (CO), New York City, & San Francisco (CA), were interviewed in 1992/93. Logistic regression analysis revealed that 48% of females & 27% of males had attempted suicide. Among females, 70% reported sexual abuse & 35% physical abuse, while among males, 24% reported sexual abuse & 35% physical abuse. Sexual & physical abuse before leaving home were independent predictors of suicide attempts for females & males. Among the abused youth, the odds of attempting suicide were 1.9 to 4.3 times those for nonabused youth. Interventions attempting to reduce risky behaviors in this population must include assessments of suicidal behaviors as well as components for assisting youth in dealing with the behavioral & emotional sequelae of physical & sexual abuse. 4 Tables, 38 References.

AB  - This article documents the living conditions of a sample of adolescents (N = 390) who had left home and were living on the street in Toronto, Canada The majority of these youth had spenta considerable amount of time without adequate shelter, food, or income; furthermore, many were involved in a variety of illegal activities and had been incarcerated or suicidal Multiple regression analyses revealed that the most consistent predictors of hunger, criminal activity, and incarceration were conditions of street life itself: thelack of secure shelter and the length of time on the street. Overal4 the living conditions of these youth closely parallel those of homeless adults. Although there are differences between adults and adolescents who live on the street, the similarities suggest that it may be inappropriate to label the latter runaways and to consistently separate adults and adolescents into two completely distinct homeless populations.

AB  - Most prior research on victimization and alcohol use among homeless youth is retrospective and thus does not allow researchers to determine the sequencing of these events. We address this gap using ecological momentary assessment via short message service surveying with homeless youth during 30 days. Multilevel binary logistic regression results revealed that experiencing physical or sexual victimization on a specific day was positively associated with youth’s drinking alcohol later that day. Because ecological momentary assessment via short message service allows for such specificity, we can link a specific victimization experience with a current drinking episode. Thus, the time ordering of daily events in the current study is a significant improvement over prior research. Understanding the timing between victimization and drinking alcohol is also important for intervention with this underserved population.

Here, issues of access to health care & related services for this population are considered, with attention to legal & ethical concerns of consent & confidentiality. Appropriate pretest & posttest counseling & follow-up for youth at risk of infection are essential. Access to comprehensive treatment is currently limited by lack of adequate financing, despite a patchwork of numerous public funding sources providing some coverage for treatment of HIV & acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

We found that on average, participants completed 18.8 days of texts, but 30% of youth (N = 44) had texting data on 28 or more days. The average number of texts answered per day was 8.49 (of a possible 11). Forty-three percent of days had answers to all 11 texts sent that day, and 69.4% of days had answers to eight or more texts. We found significant differences in response rates by phone type. Seventy-three percent of youth reported that responding to our texts was very easy or somewhat easy and 69% endorsed the response option “just enough,” regarding the number of texts sent per day. The 30-day texting period was deemed “about right” by 74% of youth. Details of using SMS with homeless youth are provided, and results indicate that this data collection technique is feasible with this population.

The runaway status variable (computed from 1980 data) was broken down into 3 categories: never runaway, runaway once, & repeat runaways (2+ occasions); the alcohol & substance abuse dependent variable was computed from 1984 data. ANOVA testing shows small differences between the runaway status groups on background & personal attributes (eg, verbal intelligence), but delinquency status was related to runaway status. The two runaway status groups had double the school dropout rate, & the repeat runaway group had significantly more alcohol, cigarette, & illicit drug usage than the once- & never-runaway groups. The largest % of heavy substance abusers were found in the repeat runaway group. There were intragender differences within the runaway groups on alcohol & substance abuse -- eg, male repeat runaways exhibited more alcohol-related problems than females. Independent of general delinquency, correlations between some types of substance abuse & runaway behavior were still found. These results support a heterogeneous pattern for runaways, with repeat runaways exhibiting more problem behavior than once or never runaways, although once runaways also show problems. 6 Tables, 20 References.

AB  -  Issue Title: Evolution of Human AggressionCoalitions and alliances are core aspects of human behavior. All societies recognize alliances among communities, usually based in part on kinship and marriage. Aggression between groups is ubiquitous, often deadly, fueled by revenge, and can have devastating effects on general human welfare. Given its significance, it is surprising how little we know about the neurobiological and hormonal mechanisms that underpin human coalitionary behavior. Here we first briefly review a model of human coalitionary behavior based on a process of runaway social selection. We then present several exploratory analyses of neuroendocrine responses to coalitionary social events in a rural Dominican community, with the objective of understanding differences between in-group and out-group competition in adult and adolescent males. Our analyses indicate: (1) adult and adolescent males do not elevate testosterone when they defeat their friends, but they do elevate testosterone when they defeat outsiders; (2) pre-competition testosterone and cortisol levels are negatively associated with strength of coalitionary ties; and (3) adult males usually elevate testosterone when interacting with adult women who are potential mates, but in a striking reversal, they have lower testosterone if the woman is a conjugal partner of a close friend. These naturalistic studies hint that reciprocity, dampening of aggression, and competition among friends and allies may be biologically embedded in unique ways among humans.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - We examined the difference in prevalence of substance use and sexual risk behaviors among at-risk youth participants in programs offered by community-based organizations in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, by gender and organization type (governmental vs. non-governmental). 388 adolescents were recruited from 25 intervention-based organizations servicing at-risk youth between the ages of 12 and 17 in Juiz de Fora. Participants completed a 15-item survey assessing substance use and sexual risk behaviors, along with socio-demographic predictors of these behaviors. Males were more likely to report drug and alcohol use associated with homelessness and abandonment. Females were more likely to report sexual risk taking associated with neighborhood crime. Participants from non-governmental organizations were less likely to engage in all measured risk behaviors. The present analysis points to the need to understand how Brazil's Child and Adolescent Act is being applied and the implications this has for intervention and the promotion of positive health outcomes for young people.

AB  - Goals of this study were to examine the frequency of depression & related constructs of suicidal ideation & hopelessness in a sample of homeless older adolescents & their associations with behaviors that may increase the risk of sexually transmitted disease (STD). Diagnostic interviews & blood/urine samples were obtained from 523 homeless adolescents (mean age=17.8). Overall, 12.2 per cent had a current DSM-IV diagnosis of major depression & 6.5 per cent had dysthymia, with higher rates for female & older participants. Depression appeared to precede rather than follow homelessness & was associated with biologically verified STDs (in older participants), infrequent condom use, a non-heterosexual orientation (in older participants), & lifetime homosexual experience. Unlike depression, suicidal ideation & hopelessness were associated with higher rates of intravenous drug use but lower rates of multiple sex partners &, in young homeless women, less sexual coercion. Depression is frequent in homeless older adolescents & has a complex association with STD-related behaviors. 2 Tables, 48 References.

AB  - Runaway is a status offense for which there is concern that youths, particularly girls, are vulnerable to the 'evils of the streets.' Prior research suggests that many personal and family risks of runaway are gendered, that the streets may be meaner, and that the strategies for survival disproportionately serve to criminalize girls. Moreover, patriarchial values may make the juvenile justice response to runaway girls overly harsh 'for their own good.' Unfortunately, research has been hampered by small or biased samples. This study examines many risk factors to discern patterns and gender differences among runaway youths for whom there is a status offense charged. Many charged runaway youths are followed to determine the nature of official responses and whether responses appear gendered. The findings have implications for changes in how officials respond to runaway youths, both in terms of what will better serve the youths' best interests and for improving public safety.

AB  - The high rates of substance use among American adolescents are challenging; however, runaway youth are at particularly high-risk for substance use. Runaway youth utilizing two service sectors, emergency crisis shelters & juvenile detention centers, were recruited to evaluate differences in risk factors associated with substance use. Findings demonstrate that youth admitted to juvenile detention (n = 121) had proportionally higher levels of problem behaviors, including substance use, than youth admitted to shelter services (n = 156). Both groups of youth have significantly higher levels of substance use than national estimates. The most significant risk factor for alcohol & marijuana use among youth in both groups was using other substances. Addressing issues of substance abuse among runaway youth must be a prime objective for future research & treatment for this high-risk population. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Objective Little is known about the reproductive health or family planning needs of street-connected children and youth in resource-constrained countries. The study objective was to describe how street-connected children and youth (SCCY) in Eldoret, Kenya, perceive pregnancy.Methods This qualitative study was conducted between August 2013 and February 2014. A total of 65 SCCY aged 11–24 years were purposively sampled from the three referral points: 1) A dedicated study clinic for vulnerable children and youth at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH); 2) Primary locations in which street children reside known as “bases/barracks”; and 3) Street youth community-based organizations. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, and translated into English. Content analysis was performed after thematic coding by 4 independent coders.Results The majority of SCCY interviewed were male (69%) and sexually active (81.5%). None had gone beyond primary level of education. The strong desire for SCCY to go through conventional life experiences including marriage and child bearing was evident. Sub-themes around desired pregnancies included: sense of identity with other SCCY, sense of hope, male ego, lineage, source of income, and avoiding stigmatization. The desire for children was highly gendered with male SCCY more focused on their social status in the street community, while for females it was primarily for survival on the street. Female SCCY generally lacked agency around reproductive health issues and faced gender-based violence. Abortions (either assisted or self-induced), infanticide, and child abandonment were reported. Respondents described a lucrative market for babies born to SCCY and alleged that healthcare workers were known to abduct these babies following hospital deliveries.Conclusion Our findings indicate gender differences in the reasons why SCCY become pregnant and have children. We also noted gender inequalities in reproductive health decisions. SCCY friendly interventions that provide tailored reproductive health services are needed.

AB  - In the present report we describe patterns of traumatic events and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), both partial and full, among homeless youth and those at risk for homelessness, with an emphasis on gender differences. Participants were 85 homeless and at-risk youth (49% female) recruited from a drop-in center in New York City in 2000. Youth completed a structured interview lasting 1.5 h. Rates of childhood maltreatment were substantial. Further, almost all youth experienced at least one traumatic event, with most experiencing multiple types of trauma. Gender differences were found in the types, but not prevalence or magnitude, of childhood maltreatment and traumatic events experienced. Partial symptomatology of PTSD was common for females but not males. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were found to co-occur with PTSD for females, which may complicate treatment efforts. Further investigation of the impact of trauma on homeless males is needed. [Copyright 2006 Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.]

AB  - Given high levels of health and psychological costs associated with the family disruption of homelessness, identifying predictors of runaway and homeless episodes is an important goal. The current study followed 179 substance abusing, shelter-recruited adolescents who participated in a randomized clinical trial. Predictors of runaway and homeless episodes were examined over a two year period. Results from the hierarchical linear modeling analysis showed that family cohesion and substance use, but not family conflict or depressive symptoms, delinquency, or school enrollment predicted future runaway and homeless episodes. Findings suggest that increasing family support, care and connection and reducing substance use are important targets of intervention efforts in preventing future runaway and homeless episodes amongst a high risk sample of adolescents.

AB  - Introduction Our understanding of youths' sex trading predominantly stems from non-representative studies with high-risk populations (e.g. homeless/runaway youth). The purpose of this study is to identify the prevalence and associated characteristics of youth who report sex trading (compared to those who do not) in a representative sample of high school students. Methods Data comes from the 2018 Youth Assessment, a cross-sectional survey administered to 9th through 12th graders across 24 high schools in Dane County, a predominantly urban area in Wisconsin, U.S.A. All youth who answered the question, "have you ever had sexual contact in order to stay safe or to get something like a place to stay, money, gifts, alcohol or drugs?" were included for secondary data analysis (n = 13,714). Participants were 70% White, 50% female/47% male, and 90% minors. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results 2.47% of youth reported sex trading, of whom 91% were minors. Bivariate analysis revealed significant differences across demographics, economic instability, behavioral health and substance use, delinquency, and romantic/sexual behaviors. Multivariate results suggested that students who reported substance use, cutting class, 3 or more out-of-school suspensions, knowing a friend involved in a gang, dating violence, foster care involvement, or identifying as LGBTQ+ were more likely to report sex trading. Conclusions Although the causal order of characteristics analyzed in relation to the sex trading is not known, these findings have important implications for sex trading prevention, assessments, and intervention, particularly among youth with marginalized identities and adverse experiences.

AB  - Extensive research on aging has demonstrated that normal aging debilitates executive function, a system that is critical for regulating stereotypes. However, there is a paucity of research on whether age-related declines to executive function actually impair older adults' ability to regulate stereotypes. My research indicates that executive function declines do exacerbate older adults' difficulty in regulating negative bias against stigmatized individuals (e.g., people with facial deformities, the obese, the homeless). After being given a standard assessment of executive function capacity, older adults were divided into high or low executive function groups based on their performance. The results identified differences in the manner in which young adults, low functioning older adults, and high functioning older adults perceive and categorize stigmas (Study 1) and how those differences affect participants' explicit and implicit attitudes toward the stigmatized in overt (Study 2) and more subtle (Study 3) evaluation tasks. Finally, the results identify the converging and diverging neural mechanisms engaged by young adults, low functioning older adults, and high functioning older adults, respectively, in evaluating stigmatized individuals (Study 4). The results indicate that older adults (particularly the low functioning sample) manifest more negative bias against stigmatized individuals than young adults. Importantly, greater executive function decline appears to interfere with older adults' ability to regulate their bias successfully. Interestingly, high functioning older adults recruit strategies (both behaviorally and neurally) to compensate for these deficits. These results provide evidence that, like many other types of cognition, stereotyping is affected by the deleterious effects of aging on cognition.

AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of location on access to justice for vulnerable defendants seeking bail.Design/methodology/approachQualitative interviews were conducted with legal practitioners from rural, suburban and urban areas as part of a larger study into bail support services in Victoria, Australia.FindingsInterview participants identified a dearth of bail support resources in rural, regional and remote (RRR) areas compared to their urban counterparts. This dearth impacted negatively on some defendants’ outcomes in the justice system, particularly for young people and those experiencing homelessness.Practical implicationsThis study helps in improving policy through greater understanding of issues with RRR service provision; adds to knowledge for service providers on access to justice; highlights specific areas of concern for vulnerable populations; and provides a more nuanced understanding of location-based issues.Originality/valueThis research found that resourcing issues cannot be understood simply through an RRR/urban binary and that more complex factors impacting access to justice and access to services for vulnerable people should be incorporated into future analysis and policy development. This more nuanced understanding is useful across national and international contexts when developing policies to improve bail support service provision.

AB  - The purpose of this research on runaway and thrownaway youth in Lincoln, Nebraska was to obtain descriptive, developmental, and sociological information about the girls and boys, ages 10-17, who had been reported as runaway youth to the Lincoln Police Department in 1999. The study was designed to sample 10% of the 904 youth who had been reported as runaways, stratified by gender and age. One of the principal objectives was to determine if each of the 60 female and 59 male participants, because of the motivation associated with their leaving home, could be appropriately placed in one of three categories. The categories were: (1) runaway; (2) thrownaway; or (3) combination runaway and thrownaway. The results of the research indicated that the participants could be accurately placed in one of the three categories. Furthermore, the findings identified differences that appeared in the characteristics of the participants in a particular category. The research also had as an objective to examine the life-span development of the participants in order to identify the characteristics of the youth and their families which were associated with the runaway and thrownaway behavior. These characteristics were found to represent a reciprocal interaction with the genetic, non-genetic biological, family, cultural, and contextual influence in their development. As these factors were studied they were found to be intricately interwoven. To determine the level of relational functioning of the participants and their families, the Global Assessment of Relational Functioning (GARF) Scale was used. Forty-nine participants and their families were identified to be functioning at the poor and very poor levels. Additionally, the severity of the participant's problems was identified along a continuum of not severe to very severe. The problems for 43 of the youth were determined to be very severe. The family structure, change in custody, school experience, exposure to risk-factors, behavioral problems, law violations, and verified psychiatric diagnoses were examined as part of tracing the developmental characteristics of the youth. Numerous participants were found to have confronted a conflicting relationship with their parents, residential instability, problems associated with school and the law, and psychological problems, many of which resulted in a verified psychiatric diagnosis.

AB  - Cette contribution traite de l'adoption et des usages de la perspective des droits dans le travail social en direction des enfants et des jeunes des rues au Mexique. Elle mobilise des données issues d'une enquete ethnographique menée a Mexico en 2008 et 2010. Partant du constat que les acteurs du travail social ont progressivement incorporé des ressources discursives et juridiques relatives aux droits de l'enfant et aux droits humains, nous proposons d'interroger le rôle et l'usage de ces éléments dans un contexte sociopolitique d'? ouverture démocratique ?. Nous verrons que ces nouvelles ressources sont mobilisées dans un cadre qui tend a les associer dans une perspective unique : l'enfoque de derecho y de genero (perspective de droits et de genre). L'analyse par le genre révéle comment cette perspective conduit a des contradictions qui réassignent les filles des rues a des rôles sociaux de sexe naturalisés. D'un côté, le monde social de la prise en charge des jeunesses des rues est travaillé ou du moins confronté au référentiel politique des droits humains imbriqué dans la perspective de genre ; de l'autre, le resultat de cette confrontation est une appropriation contradictoire qui n'est pas toujours en accord avec des principes égalitaires. L'article tente de mettre a jour ces paradoxes.

AB  - Cet article présente les résultats d'une étude administrative réalisée au CIUSSS de la Capitale-Nationale, en réponse à l'orientation 1 du plan d'action du ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux portant sur les fugues en centre de réadaptation (Gouvernement du Québec, 2018). Le premier volet de cette étude identifie les caractéristiques des jeunes hébergés dans un centre de réadaptation et dans un foyer de groupe (n = 148). Les résultats démontrent des fréquences élevées de jeunes qui présentent un trouble déficitaire de l'attention avec ou sans hyperactivité (TDAH), un problème de santé mentale et qui prennent une médication. Des analyses comparatives selon le genre révèlent que les garçons présentent davantage de problèmes de comportement tels que la violence, la consommation, et la délinquance, alors que la victimisation est plus présente chez les filles. Le second volet repose sur une analyse des besoins, conduite auprès des jeunes hébergés (n = 80), en plus de sonder les adultes impliqués auprès d'eux (n = 141). Cette analyse révèle que les besoins identifiés varient selon le type de répondants mais se situent surtout dans les sphères de vie suivantes : santé mentale, autonomie des jeunes et transition à la vie adulte, marché du travail, perception de soi, relations familiales. Ces besoins sont d'ailleurs en concordance avec les problématiques vécues par les jeunes.

AB  - Adolescents (N = 482) at elevated risk for sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome), were assessed on theoretically derived measures of knowledge & attitudes toward precautionary behavior, frequencies of high-risk sexual & substance use behaviors, & other psychosocial factors implicated in adolescents' risky behavior such as impulsivity, risk-taking propensity, & social support. The adolescent samples included 77 drug-dependent adolescents, 194 incarcerated youths, 55 homeless & runaway youths, & 156 urban African American adolescents from the US South. Drug-dependent & incarcerated youth evidenced exceedingly high HIV risk & less favorable psychosocial profiles, with drug-dependent females reporting the highest levels of overall risk. Youth in homeless shelters were lower in HIV risk & had more favorable psychosocial profiles than drug-dependent & incarcerated youth & were slightly higher on these measures than African American youth sampled from the community. Gender differences varied by sample. Findings suggest that HIV prevention programs for high-risk youth should be tailored according to gender & the specific type of high-risk audience involved. Implications of the findings for tailoring risk-reduction interventions for each group of at-risk adolescents are discussed. 5 Tables, 43 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This study investigated the association between family reunification for runaway youth and other factors (i.e., participation in family crisis counseling, number of individual/group counseling sessions, youth's age, gender, parents living together at intake, total number of presenting problems, type of presenting problems, and self-reported physical and/or sexual abuse). The participants were 586 youth who were between 9 to 18 years of age and were admitted to a runaway youth shelter in a large metropolitan area in a Midwestern state. The participants included 322 females and 264 males. The majority were African/African Americans (52.9%) and Caucasians (26.5%). The data were collected by youth counselors during the intake interview from youth and/or their parent(s) at the shelter. The findings indicated that family crisis counseling, individual/group counseling, and youth age are associated with family reunification. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between family crisis counseling and family reunification. Family reunification was more likely to occur if youth presented more problems and parents were living together. Runaway youth who come with a greater number of family-centered problems were more likely to reunify with their families than youth who have fewer family-centered problems. The results showed no significant associations between family reunification and reported physical and/or sexual abuse among youth in this sample. The limitations of the study included the use of self-reported data, the emphasis on family reunification at discharge, the unequal number of individual/group and family sessions among participants, and the correlational nature of the study. Recommendations for future research include investigating factors leading to runaway decisions, differences among youth subgroups, and comparison between runaway shelters. In addition, longitudinal research and qualitative methods would be useful in further study of runaway youth. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E.

AB  - This study characterizes subcultural differences within an inner-city street youth population. Variations in residential status, subsistence patterns, and service utilization according to peer group affiliation were explored. A brief structured interview was administered to 752 youth, ages 12 to 23 years, who had been living on the streets for two or more consecutive months, or who were fully integrated into the "street economy." Subjects were recruited for the study using a stratified probability sampling design, with 30% recruited from community-based service sites and 70% from street locations and at natural "hang-outs." Five street youth groups were identified: "punks/skinheads," "druggies," "hustlers," "gang members," and "loners." The results demonstrated unique patterns with respect to places stayed/slept, means of financial support and economic subsistence, and use of available services according to peer group affiliation. The implications of these findings and recommendations for future research and service provision are discussed.

AB  - This study explored the gender differences in sexual self-concept, personal resources for sexual health, safe sex behaviors, and risky sexual behaviors among homeless adolescents with and without histories of sexual abuse. Data for this secondary analysis were collected in 2003 to 2004 in the first phase of a larger repeated-measures sexual health intervention study; 371 homeless youth between 16 and 23 years of age (M = 19.26, SD = 1.83) were recruited from a street outreach center. The majority (64.6%) of participants were males. Self-report instruments were completed at the outreach center via audio computer-assisted self-interview (A-CASI) format. It was found that female participants were better off than males on numerous measures of sexual health behaviors and attitudes. Sexually abused participants had significantly less future time perspective (p = .05), fewer sexual self-care behaviors (p = .04), and less social support than nonabused participants (p = .01) and almost significantly more sexual risk-taking (p = .08). However, no significant differences were found between abused and nonabused participants on sexual self-concept, self-efficacy or intention to use condoms, safe sex behaviors, AIDS knowledge, assertive communication, or self-efficacy to perform testicular/ breast self-exams. Overall, participants who did not report a history of sexual abuse had significantly more sexual health resources and engaged in fewer sex-risk behaviors than those who reported having been abused. These differences have notable implications for screening adolescents for a history of sexual abuse. Adolescents who report sexual abuse should receive risk counseling and be screened regularly for the development of sexual risk behaviors. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Most of what we know about sexual abuse comes from efforts to examine female children victimized by men. Although some researchers have identified similarities between male and female victims of sexual abuse, few studies have examined gender-specific factors associated with sexual health practices among homeless adolescents. The aim of this study was to explore how gender and history of sexual abuse influence cognitive-perceptual and behavioral factors associated with sexual health practices of homeless adolescents. This study was a secondary analysis of data collected for a cross-sectional study of the sexual health practices of homeless adolescents. The sample consisted of 414 youths (104 males who reported sexual abuse and 124 who did not; and 95 females who reported sexual abuse and 75 who did not; 16 did not provide these data). Homeless adolescent females with a history of sexual abuse scored higher (indicating a shorter perspective) on a measure of future time perspective than females with no sexual abuse. Males who reported no sexual abuse scored higher than abused females on perceived health status and higher than abused males on assertive communication. With respect to perceived health status, males who reported no sexual abuse scored significantly higher than females who reported sexual abuse (p = .04). Males with no sexual abuse had significantly higher assertive communication scores than did males who had experienced sexual abuse (p = .015). We found that male and female abuse victims differ in terms of their cognitive-perceptual and behavioral factors associated with sexual health practices. Early identification of those who have been abused is critical so that interventions can be developed. Effective short-term interventions are needed for the adolescent victims of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA), particularly those who are homeless and prone to further sexual victimization.

AB  - Introduction: This study addresses the question whether group homes should be reduced, closed, or improved. The national standard only calls for group homes to be reduced or closed for children 12 years of age or under - this study agrees with this standard, but not for group homes that serve adolescents. Objectives: 1) To determine if group homes should be improved for not only court-referred older youth, but for homeless and runaway adolescents too; 2) To increase the safety at group homes serving long-term adolescents; and 3) To increase placement stability for this same population. Method: The study uses a snowball or purposive methodology to enroll 72 group care providers and advocates from a wide source of 241 foster care and non-foster care organizations and advocates. The respondents are divided into three survey groups: staff members, agency representatives/advocates, and focus group members. The focus group was comprised of former foster care and group home youth, and homeless and runaway youth. The focus group completed a review of all respondents' recommendations, which were based on an analysis of over 8,000 words from the comment sections of the surveys and approximately 2,228 responses from question sections of the three surveys. Results: Adult respondents overwhelmingly agreed that group homes for older youth should not be closed, but rather improving services should be the objective, , thereby helping to reduce the likelihood of failed or disrupted placements. The recommendations listed by the adult respondents were affirmed by the focus group. The adult respondents also overwhelmingly believed that modification to the foster care policy should accommodate homeless and runaway youth. The focus group affirmed this approach for homeless youth. However, where the adult respondents focused on runaways being homeless, the focus group questioned their motives of being runaways. Conclusion: The foster care national standards lacks a universal evaluation system at the point of the delivery of services. The lack of evaluation caused difficulty in determining a common basis for determining best-to-worse group homes. In addition, the foster care field demonstrated a strong reluctance to engage in conversations leading to the upgrade of group home services. Respondents and focus group members made key recommendations in the areas of safety, placement stability, and the types of philosophy leading to the improvement in the effectiveness of group home programs for adolescents. Agreements in the study indicate that staff training, respect, having a strong therapeutic presence, focusing on the youth's ultimate concerns, and having a philosophy based on harmony and compassion, are all needed to improve services at group homes and make them more rewarding and more beneficial, and improving relationships between adults and youth. Keywords: Foster Care, homeless youth, group homes, ecovillage, safety and placement stability, permanency, philosophy and compassion, therapeutic models, evidence-based studies, and recommendations.

AB  - Using 1992 interview data, the self-reported drug use habits & practices of theft & mendicancy among 105 street children, ages 6-18, in Porto Alegre, Brazil, are examined. Results indicate the existence of three distinct lifestyle characteristics: 25% of the children live with their families & attend school; 46% live with their families, but do not attend school; & 29% live in the streets without attending school. Data also reveal that tobacco & alcohol are the most frequently used drugs, while inhalants are preferred for illicit drug experimentation. Drug use patterns vary between the three lifestyle subgroups, with children living in the street reporting the highest use. Children living with their families report less mendicancy & more work activities than children living in the streets, while theft is reported mainly by children living in the streets & only by those also reporting illicit drug use. It is concluded that, despite being alone for several hours each day & associating with children who may use drugs, children who live with their families & attend school regularly are less likely to commit delinquent acts or use drugs. 2 Tables, 21 References.

AB  - Latino immigrant day laborers, also termed jornaleros or contingent workers, compose a significant segment of the millions of undocumented, temporary workers in our urban centers. These laborers largely work without benefit of health insurance in occupations that are unmonitored, unprotected, and often unsafe. This study utilized semi-structured interviews to explore the perceived health status and resources for health care in one group of 20 Latino day laborers in southern California. Results suggest a population that is largely in undocumented immigrant status with few health care resources other than emergency care centers and clinics provided for the homeless population. With close to 12 million undocumented workers currently residing in the US, this population bears additional scrutiny both for humanitarian reasons and for public health policy considerations.

AB  - Previous research on homeless adolescents has largely ignored the distinction between those who have left home on their own volition (runaways), and those who have been forced to leave (throwaways). Fifty-two homeless adolescents in Brisbane, Australia, were assessed to compare male and female runaways and throwaways for social adjustment and symptomatology. Differences for social adjustment (antisocial tendencies and aggression) and symptomatology (social isolation and depression) were predicted. Results indicated that male runaways were significantly more hostile than male throwaways (p less than .001), and significantly more socially isolated than female runaways (p less than .025). Female throwaways, however, were significantly more hostile than male throwaways (p less than .025) and female runaways (p less than .025). Yet homeless males overall had a significantly stronger urge to act out hostility than homeless females (p less than .025). In addition, female throwaways were significantly more antisocial than male throwaways (p less than .001). There were no significant differences for depression. A theory of inner social control (Hirschi, 1969), postulating absence of bonding in earlier socialization, was supported.

Hierarchical multiple regression analyses that included tests for curvilinear & gender interaction effects were performed. Results supported the deviance-prone model most strongly, with delinquency, but not aggressive behavior, predicting substance use. The affect-regulation model received support for females but not for males. With respect to the normative development model, moderate substance users were no better off than abstainers in terms of negative affect or interpersonal relationships. 7 Tables, 2 Figures, 68 References.

AB  - The authors examine how the properties of peer networks affect amphetamine, cocaine, and injection drug use over 3 months among newly homeless adolescents, aged 12 to 20 in Los Angeles (n = 217; 83% retention at 3 months) and Melbourne (n = 119; 72% retention at 3 months). Several hypotheses regarding the effects of social network properties on the peer influence process are developed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses show that higher concentrations of homeless peers in networks at recruitment were associated with increased likelihood of amphetamine and cocaine use at 3-month follow-up. Higher concentrations of injecting peers were associated with increased risk of injection drug use 3 months later. Change in network structure over time toward increased concentrations of homeless peers was associated with increased risk of cocaine use and injecting. Higher density networks at baseline were positively associated with increased likelihood of cocaine and amphetamine use at 3 months. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Objective: Understanding factors associated with heavy drinking among homeless youth is important for prevention efforts. Social networks are associated with drinking among homeless youth, and studies have called for attention to racial differences in networks that may affect drinking behavior. This study investigates differences in network characteristics by the racial background of homeless youth, and associations of network characteristics with heavy drinking. (Heavy drinking was defined as having five or more drinks of alcohol in a row within a couple of hours on at least one day within the past 30 days.) Method: A probability sample of 235 Black and White homeless youths ages 13-24 were interviewed in Los Angeles County. We used chi-square or one-way analysis of variance tests to examine network differences by race and logistic regressions to identify network correlates of heavy drinking among Black and White homeless youth. Results: The networks of Black youth included significantly more relatives and students who attend school regularly, whereas the networks of White youth were more likely to include homeless persons, relatives who drink to intoxication, and peers who drink to intoxication. Having peers who drink heavily was significantly associated with heavy drinking only among White youth. For all homeless youth, having more students in the network who regularly attend school was associated with less risk of heavy drinking. Conclusions: This study is the first to our knowledge to investigate racial differences in network characteristics and associations of network characteristics with heavy drinking among homeless youth. White homeless youth may benefit from interventions that reduce their ties with peers who drink. Enhancing ties to school-involved peers may be a promising intervention focus for both Black and White homeless youth. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Though few studies exist on service utilization among homeless youth in the U.S., services are important because without them, many of these young people may resort to delinquent strategies in order to meet their daily survival needs. The current study examines frequency and correlates of service utilization (i.e., shelters, food programs, street outreach, counseling, STI and HIV testing) among a sample of 249 homeless youth ages 14 to 21. Multivariate analysis revealed significant differences in service usage by sex, age, and sexual orientation. Experiencing family physical and/or sexual abuse, being kicked out of the family home, spending more nights per week sleeping on the street, and having ever stayed in a group home facility were significant correlates of homeless youths' service usage.

AB  - Explores the relationship of sexual orientation & gender to four sets of factors: (1) family history, (2) incarceration, (3) substance use, & (4) depression & suicide, in a population of homeless adolescents. A sample of homeless adolescents was recruited in Portland, OR, & assessed using semistructured interviews at baseline, three months, & six months. A total of 532 youths (216 females & 316 males) provided data on sexual orientation & other variables. Heterosexual (N = 391) & nonheterosexual youths (N = 141) were compared on all sets of factors, primarily using logistic regressions. Approximately 45% of females identified as lesbian or bisexual, while only 13.9% of males identified as gay or bisexual. Gay, lesbian, bisexual, & "unsure" (GLBU) youths were less likely to have been in foster care or arrested, but were more likely to have spent time in a locked mental health treatment facility. More than 33% of all participants reported use of injection drugs. GLBU youths were more likely to have recently used amphetamines & to have injected drugs, however, gay-bisexual males were less likely to have recently used marijuana. GLBU status was associated with recent measures of depression & suicidal ideation, but not with lifetime measures. Associations of sexual orientation with several lifetime measures were different than with prospective measures, demonstrating the limitations of using lifetime measures rather than recent or prospective measures. This population of homeless adolescents appears to be higher in its high rate of injection drug use & the large proportion of females who identify as lesbian or bisexual than found in other studies. The high rates of depression & suicidal ideation, especially among GLBU youth, are of great concern. 2 Tables, 32 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Nakonezny and Ojeda examine the relationship between health services utilization delivered by means of the Homeless Outreach Medical Services (HOMES) program and health services utilization delivered by means of the Parkland emergency room and inpatient units among a sample of older and younger homeless adults being served by the Parkland Health and Hospital System. Findings show that a significant void exists between the medical needs of the older homeless population and the current health care system in the US. The HOMES program is an example of a health care delivery model that addresses the complex and unique health care needs of individual who are homeless.

AB  - A second edition of a Vol originally published in 1993 tells the story of 12 young people who, in 1990, participated in the community service program, City Year, a city-sponsored program designed to reengage Boston (MA) youth by getting them to serve others. This program eventually became the model for President Bill Clinton's AmeriCorps program. Drawing on participant observation, the book details the early history of this program & the experiences of the young people as they sought to make a mark on their community. The group, members of which came from diverse backgrounds, variously participated in the construction of a building for the homeless, tutoring school children, & restoring a community garden. As they attended to the difficulties of others, they confronted personal challenges of their own, eg, efforts to gain admission to college, homelessness, & unwanted pregnancy. Through it all, participants are described as persisting under difficult circumstances to make progressive changes in their own lives & community. At the end of the year, City Year received a federal grant to expand its program to become a model for a system of national service. It is concluded that though the accomplishments of this group were relatively small, if multipled by a thousand other groups, they would make a considerable difference in the social life in the US.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess item characteristics indicative of the severity of risk for commercial sexual exploitation among a high-risk population of child welfare system involved youth to inform the construction of a screening tool. Existing studies have discerned factors that differentiate Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) victims from sexual abuse victims, yet no research has been conducted to discriminate which items in a high risk population of youth are most predictive of CSEC. Using the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW) cohorts I and II, we examined responses from 1063 males and 1355 females ages 11 and older, over three interview periods. A 2-parameter logistic Item Response Theory (2 PL IRT) model was employed in order to examine item performance as potential indicators for the severity of risk for CSEC. Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis was conducted in order to examine potential differences in item responses based on gender. Modeling strategies to assess item difficulty and discrimination were outlined and Item Characteristic Curves for the final retained items were presented. Evidence for uniform DIF were present within items that asked about runaway, any drug use, suicidality, and experiencing severe violence. Results from this study can inform the construction of a screening instrument to assess the severity of risk for experiencing CSEC.

AB  - This study explored the gender differences in sexual self-concept, personal resources for sexual health, safe sex behaviors, & risky sexual behaviors among homeless adolescents with & without histories of sexual abuse. Data for this secondary analysis were collected in 2003 to 2004 in the first phase of a larger repeated-measures sexual health intervention study; 371 homeless youth between 16 & 23 years of age (M = 19.26, SD = 1.83) were recruited from a street outreach center. The majority (64.6%) of participants were males. Self-report instruments were completed at the outreach center via audio computer-assisted self-interview (A-CASI) format. It was found that female participants were better off than males on numerous measures of sexual health behaviors & attitudes. Sexually abused participants had significantly less future time perspective (p = .05), fewer sexual self-care behaviors (p = .04), & less social support than nonabused participants (p = .01) & almost significantly more sexual risk-taking (p = .08). However, no significant differences were found between abused & nonabused participants on sexual self-concept, self-efficacy or intention to use condoms, safe sex behaviors, AIDS knowledge, assertive communication, or self-efficacy to perform testicular/ breast self-exams. Overall, participants who did not report a history of sexual abuse had significantly more sexual health resources & engaged in fewer sex-risk behaviors than those who reported having been abused. These differences have notable implications for screening adolescents for a history of sexual abuse. Adolescents who report sexual abuse should receive risk counseling & be screened regularly for the development of sexual risk behaviors. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Research has substantiated that homeless and runaway youth are at high risk for offending and deviant behavior. Although gender, abuse, and deviant peers have been implicated in arrests among homeless youth, we know less about whether these precursors operate similarly for police harassment as well as for postrunaway arrest. In a study of 361 Midwestern homeless and runaway youth, several differences were noted between the predictors of arrest and police harassment. First, path-analytic techniques demonstrated that having deviant friends promoted harassment but not arrest. Second, substance use was the impetus for police harassment, whereas age at first runaway was consequential for arrest. Third, physically abused youth encountered more harassment, yet minor delinquent behavior increased the risk of arrest. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2008.]

AB  - Latest developments in modern societies have altered living circumstances. Upcoming insecurities concerning employment and family relationships make life more and more incalculable. Especially young adults throughout the modern world are forced to rethink their life concepts and to desist from the lives of former generations. As difficulties to achieve a successful life increase, one could assume that the young are confronted with the impossibility of feeling happy and satisfied with their lives anymore. Yet, latest social surveys prove wrong. Although increasing unemployment, lower net income and single parenthood make life more difficult for the young, they still enjoy very high subjective quality of life in comparison to the older population. Throughout the paper I argue that it is not the objective conditions that make young adults (15-29 years old) feel overwhelmingly happy. Looking for other sources of explanation of high quality of life among people aged 29 or below, I argue for indicators of social embeddedness as being influential on their assessment of life. But again, the proportion of explained variance is smaller compared to older people. With the help of empirical data taken from the European Social Survey I highlight the differences in life circumstances between the young and the total population. Concerning occupation, habitation (kind of inhabited household) and financial situation, most of the young live under different situations compared to the adult world. But surprisingly, the rates of perceived high quality of life among the young do not vary to such a large extent as among the adults. I show that young adults, often damned to fail social demands because of their withdrawal from social life, are still the most happy in modern (more and more individualizing?) societies. But it gets more difficult to account for the reasons of their happiness. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Refugees are exposed to extreme stressors and are therefore at risk of mental health and social problems. Other issues refugees have to cope with include the loss of their country, culture, language, profession, family, friends, and future plans. Much of the studies that have been done on refugee mental health have not attempted to explain what these experiences mean to these individuals. Thus, this study provides explorative data on the mental health and quality of life of West African refugees living in Nigeria in order to understand their views and perspectives. This study carried out in 2010 employed qualitative methods; a total of four focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted among adult male and female refugees purposively selected at the Oru Refugee Camp, Ogun State, Nigeria. Respondents described quality of life as a major determinant of mental health status. Most of the participants believed that women were more predisposed to mental ill health due to their sensitive emotional make-up. Factors identified by respondents as affecting mental health and quality of life among refugees included poverty, unemployment, physical health, housing and environment, discrimination, stigmatization, and insecurity. Refugees rated their mental health and quality of life as poor due to the aforementioned factors. Recommendations were made to the international community, national and local governments to invest more on education, provision of vocational and entrepreneurial skills as well as adequate housing in order to improve the mental health and quality of life of refugees.

AB  - Questionnaire & inventory data from 52 homeless adolescents recruited from 7 youth shelters & 1 drop-in center in Brisbane, Australia, are drawn on to compare the social adjustment & symptomatology of male (M) & female (F) youths who have left home on their own volition (runaways) with those who have been forced to leave (throwaways). The findings indicate that M runaways are significantly more hostile than M throwaways, & more socially isolated than F runaways. F throwaways, however, are significantly more hostile than both M throwaways & F runaways. Nonetheless, homeless Ms generally have a significantly stronger desire to act out hostility than do homeless Fs, while F throwaways are significantly more antisocial than M throwaways. No significant differences for depression are evidenced. Findings support T. Hirschi's theory of inner social control (Causes of Delinquency, Berkeley: U of California Press, 1969), postulating absence of bonding in earlier socialization, as a factor in delinquency. 2 Tables, 28 References.

AB  - Research has shown that physical and sexual maltreatment precipitate runaway behavior in adolescents. However, there have been few large-scale examinations of the family, school, and personal problems of maltreated adolescents. In the present paper, an 85-item Client Information Record was completed on 2,019 runaways by shelter staff from eight southeastern states. There were significant differences in the problems reported by physically abused and sexually abused runaways when compared to their nonabused runaway peers. Runaways who were both physically and sexually maltreated were significantly more vulnerable and much worse off than those who only experienced either physical or sexual abuse. Implications for the treatment of maltreated runaways are discussed.

AB  - In this study, data on sexual victimization in the histories of 89 Canadian male runaways as well as information on physical victimization, family structure, family financial stability, delinquent and criminal activities, and reasons for running away from home were evaluated. The population of male runaways evidenced dramatically higher rates of sexual and physical abuse than did randomly sampled populations. Sexually abused and nonsexually abused male runaways shared characteristics noted in the literature as common to runaways: problem families, high rates of delinquency, depression, tension, low self-image, and history of physical abuse. Sexually abused male runaways differed from nonsexually abused runaways in their reactions to their runaway event, with sexually abused male runaways responding in highly avoidant patterns coupled with extreme withdrawal from all types of interpersonal relationships. These differences are explained as consistent with known sequelae of sexual abuse, and the implications for treatment by runaway shelters and for further research are suggested.

AB  - A field study used 1008 "lost letters" to test the hypotheses that the differences in returned responses would be attributable to the addressee (ie, ending homelessness -- control or preventing it among youth, veterans, & lesbians) & especially to a socially deviant addressee; cultural differences between distribution locations might influence returned responses of lost letters; & sender address (ie, urban, rural, & control) would also influence returned responses. Both addressees' affiliations & distribution location were associated with returned responses, with the lowest rates being for the Prevent Lesbian Homelessness Program affiliate overall & for the city of Pensacola, respectively. Antigay prejudice toward a deviant group may still be strong even when a helping act can be performed without intimate contact involving members of a deviant group. Neither distribution location, nor the sender, or return address conditions were associated with different returned responses. Further testing of the lost letter technique, as a measure of public response, may be warranted. 1 Table, 25 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The primary aim of this study was to describe the abuse experiences of sexually exploited runaway adolescents seen at a Child Advocacy Center (N = 62). We also sought to identify risk behaviors, attributes of resiliency, laboratory results for sexually transmitted infection (STI) screens, and genital injuries from colposcopic exams. We used retrospective mixed-methods with in-depth forensic interviews, together with self-report survey responses, physical exams and chart data. Forensic interviews were analyzed using interpretive description analytical methods along domains of experience and meaning of sexual exploitation events. Univariate descriptive statistics characterized trauma responses and health risks. The first sexual exploitation events for many victims occurred as part of seemingly random encounters with procurers. Older adolescent or adult women recruited some youth working for a pimp. However, half the youth did not report a trafficker involved in setting up their exchange of sex for money, substances, or other types of consideration. 78% scored positive on the UCLA PTSD tool; 57% reported DSM IV criteria for problem substance use; 71% reported cutting behaviors, 75% suicidal ideation, and 50% had attempted suicide. Contrary to common depictions, youth may be solicited relatively quickly as runaways, yet exploitation is not always linked to having a pimp. Avoidant coping does not appear effective, as most patients exhibited significant symptoms of trauma. Awareness of variations in youth's sexual exploitation experiences may help researchers and clinicians understand potential differences in sequelae, design effective treatment plans, and develop community prevention programs.

AB  - This cross-sectional study investigated the relationships between psychiatric and substance-related disorders, high-risk behaviors, and the onset, duration, and frequency of homelessness among homeless youth in Chicago. Sixty-six homeless youth were recruited from two shelters in Chicago. Demographic characteristics, psychopathology, substance use, and risk behaviors were assessed for each participant. Increased frequency and duration of homeless episodes were positively correlated with higher rates of psychiatric diagnoses. Increased number of psychiatric diagnoses was positively correlated with increased high-risk behaviors. Participants with diagnoses of Current Suicidality, Manic Episodes, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Substance Abuse, and Psychotic Disorder had a higher chronicity of homelessness than those without diagnoses. Significant differences were evident between the three time parameters, suggesting that stratification of data by different time variables may benefit homelessness research by identifying meaningful subgroups who may benefit from individualized interventions.

Focus is on the relationship of these dimensions to sexual risk-taking, ie, the tendency to engage in unprotected intercourse, which increases vulnerability to acquired immune deficiency syndrome & other sexually transmitted diseases. Seven themes were isolated from the interview scripts: permissiveness, double standards, belief about sexual control, romance, regrets about permissiveness, sexual aggression, & questioning. Measures of 4 of these themes were constructed, & differences by gender & subgroup explored, as were the relationships between themes & sexual risk.

AB  -  Utilizing a sample of 300 homeless street youths, the research examines the individual-level sub-model of Baumer's interpretation of Merton's anomie theory. The paper explores the role the interaction between monetary goals and weak commitment to legitimate means plays in the generation of instrumental crime and the manner in which this interaction is itself moderated by blocked opportunities, monetary dissatisfaction, social modeling, cultural support, and the perceived risk of punishment. The findings reveal that a weak commitment to legitimate means, but not monetary goals, has a lower order impact on the willingness to commit instrumental crime. These two variables, however, do not interact to predict intentions to offend. Instead the findings reveal that blocked opportunities and higher levels of monetary dissatisfaction moderate the relationship between the monetary goals and weak commitment to legitimate means interaction and the willingness to offend. Findings are discussed and suggestions for further research are offered. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Following the financial crisis of 2008, the UK government accelerated a number of market-based interventions into public problems. Experimenting with new forms of intervention provided a moment to effectively problematize the public sector as a whole and its budgets, opening up for discussion the basis for making an intervention, and the methods and costs involved. Questions were posed of the apparently irreducible costs associated with supposedly intractable problems of government (such as homelessness, vulnerable children or crime). In particular, crisis and austerity became a means to give new momentum to a series of experimental ways to shape the social investment market that had been under discussion in various forms since at least 2000. Social Impact Bonds form one particular type of intervention. They involve drawing together investors with delivery agencies, the third sector and national and local government, coordinated by a commissioner. In the recent move by the UK government to set up and use Social Impact Bonds, much has been made of the opportunity they represent to introduce competition, efficiency, efficacy, private sector thinking and investment to a range of different social problems. As the first results of these experiments are now emerging, this article reports on a study conducted into a market-based intervention that experiments with the transformation of ‘children at-risk’ into an investment proposition through a Social Impact Bond. The article suggests that the Social Impact Bond can be usefully explored by drawing on Science and Technology Studies (STS) treatments of markets as collective, heterogeneous assemblages. However, in contrast to scholars who focus on market devices, the article argues that the Social Impact Bond in practice operates as something akin to an anti-market device. The article begins with an introduction to Social Impact Bonds. It then explores the means through which market-based competition and an investment proposition were anticipated, but did not emerge through the composition and enactment of the Bond. It concludes with an assessment of the anti-market device and the future of Social Impact Bonds.

AB  -  Services for homeless youth traditionally provided shelter and nourishment but do little to break the cycle of homelessness. A more comprehensive approach to serve homeless youth is the drop-in center model that provides safe and easy-to-find facilities within communities to bridge the gap between the streets and transitional/permanent housing. Research describing homeless youth who utilize drop-in centers is lacking. This study examines characteristics/ preferences of 96 homeless adolescents attending one of two drop-in centers in Southern California. Homeless youth reported high prevalence of risk behaviors regardless of the center of attendance. Furthermore, our analyses revealed significant differences related to demographics, sexual risk behaviors, and substance use between homeless youth at the two drop-in centers. These findings illuminate the specific characteristics and preferences of homeless youth who attend drop-in centers and can be used to inform providers, advocates, and policy makers.

AB  - Among LGBTQ youth, suicidality and homelessness occur at heightened rates. Using the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS), this study seeks to explore the associations of having a parent, family member, friend, or romantic partner in one’s social network and not being “out” to specific network members (lack of disclosure) with ITS constructs (perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belonging), considering homelessness history. Data include 462 youth aged 12–24 who contacted an LGBTQ youth-focused suicide crisis provider from 2015 to 2017. Disclosure status and network composition differed by homelessness experience. Homeless youth were more likely to disclose to their parents and less likely to disclose to other family members. Youth who had not disclosed to their parents reported higher perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belonging whereas having more family members and peers in one’s network was associated with lower scores on ITS constructs. Implications for prevention approaches with youth who may be at increased risk for suicide are discussed.

AB  - To effectively combat the AIDS health crisis among adolescents, future research must address three key issues: (a) the risk of disease for culturally differing adolescent populations, particularly African-American adolescents; (b) the need for empirical investigations to identify and understand the variables influencing adolescents 'adoption of HIV-preventive sexual practices; and (c) the development of more effective prevention programs to reduce adolescents' existing HIV-associated risk behaviors. This article reviews the relevance of these issues for prevention research and suggests policy recommendations. These recommendations argue for: (a) expanded funding for basic behavioral surveys to identify the prevalence of risk-taking behavior among adolescents in general, and among high-risk adolescent subgroups, for example, incarcerated and homeless adolescents; (b) encouraging more epidemiologic and ethnographic research to understand the psychosocial and cultural variables associated with high and low-risk behavior among understudied and underserved racial/ethnic populations such as African-American adolescents; and (c) urging that evaluation of HIV prevention programs include multisite trials and larger samples in ethnically and geographically diverse populations.

AB  - National level data show food insecurity/insufficiency is more common in Latino families than the dominant population, however local ethnic rates aren't often available, nor have there been many studies of food insufficiency/insecurity among Latino ethnic groups. This study presents food insufficiency data from three low income immigrant Latino Chicago communities. Data were collected as part of a larger study of ethnic Latino differences in health and nutrition attitudes/behaviors and child health services use. Face to face interviews were conducted with 320 mothers of Latino children entering school for the first time (mean age 5.5 years). Food insufficiency questions from the Radimer/Cornell and NHANES III instruments were used. Participants were 70% Mexican, 22% Puerto Rican and 8% other Latino, reflecting Chicago Latino distribution. Thirty percent (n  = 96) reported household food insufficiency, although most was worry about obtaining food, and was due to lack of money or Food Stamps. Some families experienced more severe food access problems, namely adults and children skipping meals, and adults or children going without food for an entire day.

AB  - The history of judicial treatment of juveniles is reviewed. Some early challenges to state juvenile court acts based upon the denial of constitutional rights through the device of indeterminate confinement & some recent challenges based upon denial of due process rights & failure of the state to provide treatment for the confined juvenile are discussed. The recent relevant US Supreme Court decisions on due process--the cases of Kent, Gault, DeBacker, McKeiver, & Winship --are reviewed. While these reveal some relief to juveniles & offer guidance to courts across the country, they have been limited. They do not protect the due process rights in the handling of juveniles during apprehension, arrest or detention prior to trial & the rights of those juveniles who are dependent, neglected, in need of supervision, truant, runaway, or accused of certain offenses of which only juveniles can be guilty, ie, smoking, drinking, staying out late. Trends in the 1960's toward retroactive application of constitutional rights guarantees in the courts are examined. 2 important juvenile problems have not yet been adequately dealt with: lack of due process throughout the entire range of encounters with the law, & indeterminate confinement with good intentions. The larger question is whether juveniles are to be considered "persons" & whether they are entitled to full protection under the supreme law of the land. Due process for juveniles rests on a restoration of their constitutional rights. M. Maxfield.

AB  - This study measured food security and hunger of households enrolled in Head Start in Houston, Texas, and Birmingham, Alabama and assessed factors that could affect food security. Interviewers collected data from primary caregivers on demographic characteristics, dietary intake, and the six-item US food security module. The prevalence of food insecurity of 688 households with Head Start children was 34.9%, or twice that of the national average among households with children in 2004 (17.6%). Moreover, the prevalence of food insecurity for households of White children (34.1%) and of Hispanic children (50.8%) exceeded by two-fold the national averages for the same race/ethnic groups, whereas the prevalence among African American households (24.8%) was similar to the nationwide average. Within the study sample, there were significant differences in the race/ethnicity for food security status. Households with U. S. born caregivers had significantly lower percentages of food insecurity (28.6% food insecure) than households with foreign-born caregivers (50.3% food insecure). This study identified groups most vulnerable to food insecurity, and the continual need to monitor food security among participants in Head Start. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - In this article, I explore how different groups of the precariat endure and struggle with specific and hierarchical forms of precarity in Seoul. By paying attention to which precarity matters, and to whom it belongs, I examine the friction between the educated youth—the “deserving” precariat that can speak—and the urban poor, who endure abandonment. This collaborative project, in which university students encountered welfare recipients and homeless people through interviews with antipoverty activists, unveils the complex reality that one group’s attempt to react to their precarity risks marginalizing or exacerbating the precarity faced by another group. The affective discourses of fairness and security, which are often embodied and fetishized by precarious youth who are struggling to survive, turn out to have fostered a deeper marginalization and criminalization of the urban poor. Instead of reducing this finding to a critique of the differential distribution of precarity, I reposition my ethnography as an experimental and pedagogical project, in which an anthropologist’s “field” is created with the expansion of research inquiries, findings, reflections, and actions. As such, ethnography serves as a kind of activism to connect the bounded circles of the precariat and demonstrate new predicaments and possibilities in an open-ended manner.

AB  - The purpose of this dissertation was to better understand the psychosocial problems (mental health problems, substance use problems, and sexual risk behaviors) and the associated contextual risk factors by comparing homeless sexual minority youths with their heterosexual counterparts. This study used an ecological perspective (Bronfenbrenner, 1989) and a risk and protective factors framework (Hawkins, Catalano, & Miller, 1992) to identify contextual risk factors at the microsystem, mesosystem, and macrosystem levels that are associated with the psychosocial problems of homeless sexual minority and homeless heterosexual youths. Individuals aged 16-24 were recruited from three drop-in programs serving homeless youths in downtown Toronto (N=147). Structured interviews were conducted with each participant. Bivariate analyses indicated statistically significant differences between homeless sexual minorities (n=66) and their heterosexual counterparts (n=81) regarding mental health, substance use and sexual risk behaviors, as well as contextual factors such as peers, family communication, stigma, and discrimination with sexual minority youths faring more poorly. Results of multiple regression analyses indicated that sexual identity moderated the relationship between negative peers and three psychosocial behaviors: sexual risk behaviors, condom use and substance use. Among sexual minorities, having peers who engaged in negative behaviors was associated with increased risky behaviors, but for homeless heterosexual youths, there was no effect between negative peers and their sexual risk behaviors and substance use. Results also indicated that sexual identity did not moderate the relationship between other contextual factors (i.e., family communication, stigma, or discrimination) and psychosocial outcomes such as mental health, substance use, and sexual risk behaviors. Understanding the nature and direction of the differences between homeless sexual minority youths and their heterosexual counterparts is an important first step in reducing disparities regarding negative outcomes of this population of youths.

AB  - To examine the differential effects of various forms of child abuse & maltreatment, as well as their combined effects, interview & scale data were collected from 329 homeless adolescents, sampled from drop-in centers in Seattle/King County, WA. Preliminary analyses indicated some degree of matching for family background variables. Any differences in demographic or family characteristics were controlled for statistically. Chi-square analyses revealed significant differences across groups for rates of assault, rape, depression/dysthymia, & attempted suicide. Multivariate analyses indicated significant differences in severity of internalizing problems & cognitive problems. Without exception, those with histories of both physical & sexual abuse exhibited the most severe symptomatology & were at greater risk for revictimization. Multiple regression analyses suggested that abuse histories were predictive of internalizing problems, while family characteristics were more predictive of externalizing problems. Findings indicate that both abuse type & family characteristics contribute to the development of symptomatology. Future prospective & longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the sequelae of abuse, as well as the possible cause & effect relations between abuse, family characteristics, & psychological outcomes. 5 Tables, 1 Figure, 77 References.

AB  - This article compares heterosexual and sexual minority street-involved youth across a number of sociodemographic, risk and current mental health, victimization and delinquency measures with a particular focus on gender differences. The sample consists of 147 homeless and street-involved young men and women aged 16-21 years in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Bivariate analyses indicate that many of the differences between the heterosexual and sexual minority youth are driven by differences among the young women. Multivariate analyses are then used to test for interactions between gender and sexual minority status alongside controls. The results suggest that gender, sexuality and street involvement intersect to shape outcomes in more complex ways than are acknowledged by the notion of accumulating or multiplying disadvantage common in the literature. The article concludes with a discussion focused on providing a more nuanced view of the experience of youth homelessness at the intersection of gender and sexuality. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Adolescence is a developmental period during which many youth experiment with risk practices. This paper examined the association of parental monitoring with a range of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use behaviors among high-risk youth, while controlling for other demographic and environmental variables previously found to be associated with AOD use. Participants were recruited as part of a longitudinal evaluation study of four youth drop-in centers located in Southern California. These centers served at-risk youth, including Hispanic, Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Questioning (LGBQ), and homeless and runaway youth. Participants were aged 14 to 24 and were new attendees at the drop-in centers. Results from logistic regression analyses revealed that while controlling for demographic and environmental variables, adolescents who reported less parental monitoring were more likely to report lifetime use of cigarettes, marijuana, and methamphetamine, and in the past three months, use of alcohol and binge drinking. The findings thus indicate that, even among high-risk youth, those who reported low parental monitoring were significantly more likely to use a variety of substances. Implications of these findings are discussed as they pertain to AOD prevention and interventions for children and their families. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Homeless people are not a homogeneous group. Although they share the condition of great and multidimensional -- and often also long term -- social exclusion, there are many differences among them. From the point of professional work in this field it is important to be aware of the risk factors that -- among other things -- influence also the extent to which the homeless are willing to accept services and to which extent they can be reached by the organizations' offers of services. The aim of the research was to prove the differences among the subgroups of the homeless people regarding different risk factors. The sample consisted of 107 of Ljubljana's homeless people, and a questionnaire was applied to this sample, asking about different risk factors, be it from their family and institutional life past, or from the actual homeless life. The results show that the subgroups specially burdened by the risk factors are groups of younger people, who use illegal drugs and who have experienced their first period of homelessness earlier in their lives. Another such group are people with mental health problems. These findings should be reflected in the appropriate orientations of workers in this field and in the appropriate policies in this field.

AB  - Gender-specific explanations for living in the street were tested with ethnographic research & psychological testing of 42 male & 19 female children, ages 8-17, in the slums of Kibera & Mathare in Nairobi, Kenya. Test data found only partial support for the hypothesis that street girls would exhibit more psychological maladjustment than boys, because they would only end up on the street if there were a breakdown in the family process that traditionally keeps poor girls at home. Ethnographic data revealed that these girls' broken homes contributed to sexual abuse & sibling rivalry. Street girls were victims -- forced into prostitution or rejected by others. However, street boys were often fully able to cope & act like adults by age 10 & maintained contact with their families. It is concluded that girls end up on the street because of a broken developmental path. 35 References. M. Pflum

AB  - In the present report we describe patterns of traumatic events and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), both partial and full, among homeless youth and those at risk for homelessness, with an emphasis on gender differences. Participants were 85 homeless and at-risk youth (49% female) recruited from a drop-in center in New York City in 2000. Youth completed a structured interview lasting 1.5 h. Rates of childhood maltreatment were substantial. Further, almost all youth experienced at least one traumatic event, with most experiencing multiple types of trauma. Gender differences were found in the types, but not prevalence or magnitude, of childhood maltreatment and traumatic events experienced. Partial symptomatology of PTSD was common for females but not males. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were found to co-occur with PTSD for females, which may complicate treatment efforts. Further investigation of the impact of trauma on homeless males is needed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - A census of homeless youth was conducted in locations across Los Angeles County, California. Building on previous research that has focused on homeless youth in cruise areas, the authors examined demographic and behavioral differences between homeless youth in cruise and noncruise areas. Youth in cruise areas were more likely than youth in noncruise areas to be older, to have been away from home longer, to have recently visited community-based agencies, and were likely to have resided in shelters and less likely to attend school. These data suggest possible selection bias in earlier studies that relied primarily on homeless youth from cruise areas. 3 Tables, 44 References.

The objective of this study is to assess the household food security status of people living below the poverty line (BPL) and its impact on the health of women and children in the selected coastal areas of Kochi in Kerala. Household food security was assessed using a food security core module questionnaire on 500 BPL families in coastal Kochi. The utilization of PDS, nutritional status and diet pattern of women and children 3-6years (sub sample 37) were studied. The results showed that PDS was best utilized by the majority. Poor quality of rice and inadequate quantity of commodities such as sugar forced the respondents to buy from the open market. Only 43% families were food secure, and the case of the rest of them food insecurity levels varied from no hunger to severe hunger. Significant differences in weight and height of children and the levels of food security were found. The study revealed the current food security status and identified the short comings in PDS. It shows the importance of PDS in ensuring food security and thereby good health for women and children.

AB  - While there is a growing body of research on intimate partner violence (IPV) experienced by the housed youth population, a limited amount is known about IPV experienced by homeless youth. To our knowledge, no previous studies have examined how homeless youths' experience of IPV is related to their social network, even though the social networks of homeless youth have been shown to be significant indicators of health and mental health. The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship between IPV, gender, and social networks among a sample of 386 homeless youth in Los Angeles, California. Results revealed that one fifth of the sample experienced IPV in the past year. Stratified regression models revealed that IPV was not significantly related to any measure of male social networks; however, females who experienced IPV had more male friends (β = 2.03, SE = 0.89, p < .05) than females who did not experience IPV. Female homeless youth who witnessed family violence during childhood had more male friends (β = 2.75, SE = 1.08, p < .05), but those who experienced sexual abuse during childhood had fewer male friends (β = -2.04, SE = 0.93, p < .05). Although there was no significant difference in the rate of IPV victimization across genders, the context of this abuse appears to be drastically different. The results suggest that females with more male friendships are at greater risk for exposure to IPV. To date, there are few effective youth-targeted IPV prevention programs and none have been shown to be effective with homeless youth. These results provide insight into future program development.

AB  -  Food insecurity is a pressing public health concern in many developing countries. Despite widespread interest in the sociocultural determinants of food insecurity, little is known about whether youths living in food insecure households experience food insecurity. The buffering hypothesis reviewed here assumes that, to the extent possible, adult members of households will buffer younger household members from the ill effects of food insecurity. A variant of the buffering hypothesis argues that only certain members of the households will enjoy the benefits of buffering. We hypothesize that within the context of Ethiopia, where girls have historically experienced discrimination, buffering is preferentially aimed at boys, especially as the household experiences greater levels of food stress. These hypotheses are tested using data from a population-based study of 2084 adolescents living in southwestern Ethiopia. Results indicate that boys and girls were equally likely to be living in severely food insecure households. Despite no differences in their households' food insecurity status, girls were more likely than boys to report being food insecure themselves. This gender difference was the largest in severely food insecure households. This same pattern was observed when comparing male-female sibling pairs living in the same household. These results are among the first to show that household level measures of food insecurity predict adolescent experiences of food insecurity, and that in the Ethiopian socio-cultural context, the relationship between household level food insecurity and adolescent food insecurity varies by gender. We also show that adolescent food insecurity is strongly associated with measures of general health and well-being. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Adolescence is a developmental period during which many youth experiment with risk practices. This paper examined the association of parental monitoring with a range of alcohol & other drug (AOD) use behaviors among high-risk youth, while controlling for other demographic & environmental variables previously found to be associated with AOD use. Participants were recruited as part of a longitudinal evaluation study of four youth drop-in centers located in Southern California. These centers served at-risk youth, including Hispanic, Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Questioning (LGBQ), & homeless & runaway youth. Participants were aged 14 to 24 & were new attendees at the drop-in centers. Results from logistic regression analyses revealed that while controlling for demographic & environmental variables, adolescents who reported less parental monitoring were more likely to report lifetime use of cigarettes, marijuana, & methamphetamine, & in the past three months, use of alcohol & binge drinking. The findings thus indicate that, even among high-risk youth, those who reported low parental monitoring were significantly more likely to use a variety of substances. Implications of these findings are discussed as they pertain to AOD prevention & interventions for children & their families. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Ethnic minorities have insisted that media images of their constituents reveal an unrelenting negativity in their portrayal. Media researchers have pointed to the negative depictions of ethnic minorities in a variety of studies (Tator 1999; Fleras 1995; Miller 1994; Ungerleider 1991). In studies emerging in the 1970s, researchers in Canada have consistently pointed out that the media "stagnate... on race-specific and culture conscious characterizations of people" (Wong 1977:269). Canadian media continue to rely on both negative and stereotypical depictions of ethnic minorities (Roth 1996; Media Watch 1994; Fleras 1994; Zolf 1989). Fleras (1994) has explained how ethnic minority images in Canadian media are consistently stereotypical ones, "steeped in unfounded generalizations that veer towards the comical or grotesque" (Fleras 1994:273), where the examples of ethnic minorities as "social problems" are routinely employed: namely, as pimps, high-school dropouts, homeless teens, or drug pushers in Canadian dramatic series. As he puts it, "The media rely on minorities as... a foil for sharpening the attributes of mainstream heroes, a catalyst for driving plot lines or character development, or a token dash of colour to an otherwise pallid cultural package" (Fleras and Kunz 2001:155). Fleras makes the crucial note that ethnic minorities are rarely represented as people who have something important to say -- instead, their "lived experiences [are] reduced to the level of an 'angle'... for spicing up plot lines" (Fleras 1995:6). The ex-media critic for the Globe and Mail, John Haslett Cuff, has commented that on television, images of black Canadians on television are often limited to roles of villains or victims, or buffoons and folksy sitcom types (Cuff 1990; see also Daley 1997).11. Several media researchers observe the need to examine discourses about ethnic minorities that prevail in newsrooms in Canada. Unfortunately, few of us have had the opportunity to conduct interviews with media workers, primarily because of the difficulty in acquiring access and because many media workers have expressed concerns over confidentiality (Mahtani 2001a). More than any other area, researchers insisted the importance of anchoring studies about ethnic minority representation through a situated analysis of organizational and behavioural practices within the media's sites of production. In interviews with media researchers, it was suggested that we go straight "to the source"-- the media organizations themselves -- in order to better comprehend why these negative portrayals proliferate. We need to extend existing studies by interviewing media professionals, especially journalists, to understand the mechanisms through which distorted and stereotypical representations are produced. Who makes decisions around media representations of minorities? What is the relationship between institutional representation and media representation of minorities? Are ethnic minorities involved in the production of these images? Does it make a difference if there are more ethnic minorities working in media production, or are they effectively silenced in the newsroom, as some suggest (Mahtani 2001a; Henry and Tator 2000; Henry 1999). In other words, what are the experiences of media workers of colour? A media researcher suggested "focusing upon the experiences of minority newsmakers who work in relatively homogeneous workplaces... does the question of ethnic identity figure more strongly for minority media practitioners than for white practitioners?" John Miller recommended conducting a study similar to his own 1994 analysis of institutional representation of minorities. Others agreed, proposing quantitative analysis projects that would help us acquire more statistics on the number of minorities behind the scenes at various media organizations. One media worker asked: "How many senior executives, programers, directors, editors, etc. are visible, ethnic, religious minorities? Assuming that these numbers are small, how do we change them?"

AB  - Although a substantial body of literature demonstrates high prevalence of street victimization among homeless youth, few studies have investigated the existence of victimization classes that differ on the type and frequency of victimization experienced. Nor do we know how substance use patterns relate to victimization classes. Using latent class analysis (LCA), we examined the existence of victimization classes of homeless youth and investigated substance use predictors of class membership utilizing a large purposive sample (N = 601) recruited from homeless youth-serving host agencies in three disparate regions of the U.S. Results of the LCA suggest the presence of three distinct victimization profiles -- youth fit into a low-victimization class, a witness class, or a high-victimization class. These three victimization classes demonstrated differences in their substance use, including rates of substance abuse/dependence on alcohol and/or drugs. The presence of distinct victimization profiles suggests the need for screening and referral for differential services. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - A large administrative data set allows us to examine shelter use by single adults, youth, and families in Toronto. We find important differences in shelter use by single adults, youth, and families. We introduce an approach that allows us to identify a noticeable increase in the percentage of shelter clients whom we define as chronic users of the shelter system-people for whom each episode of shelter use is typically very long. This should be a concern because chronic users of the system, although they make up only a small fraction of all shelter clients, fill more than 40 percent of shelter capacity. A growing number of chronic shelter users will strain the ability of the shelter system to provide shelter to those seeking temporary relief while they re-establish themselves into housing. Homeless shelters are a response to a serious social problem. They are not the cause of nor are they the solution to that problem. Growing shelter use is an indication of a social order in trouble.

AB  - Data obtained from a large, longitudinal study are used to explore the delinquent behavior of 503 African American, Hispanic, & white non-Hispanic adolescent girls attending public schools in Miami, FL. The primary objectives of the study were to determine the prevalence of 13 self-reported delinquent behaviors, compare these rates among the three groups of students, & explore the predictive influences of several family factors that correlate with delinquency. It was found that 37.5% of the sample engaged in one or more acts of serious delinquency, with African Americans reporting significantly more such behaviors. The best predictors of theft/vandalism were low family pride & family substance abuse for Hispanics, low family communication for African Americans, & low family pride for white non-Hispanics. Findings indicate that family factors traditionally used to understand delinquency by male adolescents were not strong predictors of delinquency among these adolescent girls. 6 Tables, 2 Figures, 37 References.

For example, it is difficult to know the exact number of children living on the street due to their constant moving about from one location to another. The children's characteristics vary: some believe they will never have a future, others return to their families & later go back to the streets, & many simply never fit in with society. Also discussed are the approximate ages of the children, the role that drugs play on a day-to-day basis, the lack of a father figure in the household as a determinant of leaving home, & the types of interventions that might bring such children to safety.

AB  - The development of measures of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome)-related knowledge & beliefs among adolescents -- selection of appropriate items through literature review, evaluation by focus groups, pilot testing, & review by advisory councils -- is described. The resulting measures were administered to 3 samples of adolescents at high risk for contracting AIDS: 43 runaway males, 43 runaway females, & 36 self-identified gay males. Both the knowledge & belief instruments demonstrated moderately high internal consistency & test-retest reliability. Gay males were found to possess significantly greater knowledge of AIDS; however, few differences in beliefs were found among the 3 groups. Knowledge of AIDS was significantly correlated with beliefs about its prevention. It is concluded that the measures successfully identify gaps in knowledge among high-risk youth. 1 Table, 2 Appendixes, 29 References. Modified HA

AB  - In this paper we present national estimates of the association between the housing circumstances of young Australian families and the developmental outcomes of children aged between 4 and 9 years old using the third wave of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). We find large differences in measures of both receptive vocabulary and emotional and behavioural problems according to the housing tenure of childrens families with children in public housing displaying the worst outcomes. We also find evidence that residential mobility adversely affects the outcomes of some children. Interestingly, we do not find that housing stress, as measured by the 30/40 rule, has any association with the developmental outcomes of children after taking into account the low household incomes of these families.

AB  - The current study longitudinally examines the effects of child maltreatment, parenting, and disadvantaged neighborhood on victimization, delinquency, and well-being via running away and school engagement among a sample of 360 high-risk adolescents. Results of a path analysis revealed that parenting was associated with school engagement, running away, and well-being. Childhood neglect was related to victimization while sexual abuse and living in a more disadvantaged neighborhood were associated with poorer well-being. Greater school engagement was associated with higher levels of well-being and a lower likelihood of delinquency. Finally, running away was positively associated with participating in delinquent activities. In terms of the interactions, results showed that the effect of positive parenting on well-being was significantly stronger for females and the manner in which neglect related to school engagement was greater among males. Additionally, gender significantly moderated the relationship between running away and victimization and between running away and delinquency, both of which the effects were significantly stronger for males. Implications for families and adolescents are addressed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - We exploited an exogenous health shock--namely, the birth of a child with a severe health condition--to investigate the effect of a life shock on homelessness in large cities in the United States as well as the interactive effects of the shock with housing market characteristics. We considered a traditional measure of homelessness, two measures of housing instability thought to be precursors to homelessness, and a combined measure that approximates the broadened conceptualization of homelessness under the 2009 Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act ( 2010 ). We found that the shock substantially increases the likelihood of family homelessness, particularly in cities with high housing costs. The findings are consistent with the economic theory of homelessness, which posits that homelessness results from a conjunction of adverse circumstances in which housing markets and individual characteristics collide.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This article provides a case study of a drop-in center serving homeless youth, focusing on staff-client conflict. It is the result of approximately 200 hours of ethnographic research and in-depth interviews with staff members. This article explores how and why staff actively utilize the exclusionary practices of withdrawal, nonengagement, and silencing. Second, it examines how these practices, which are meant to he therapeutic and prevent conflict, paradoxically create, sustain, and escalate much of the staff-client conflict within the center, forcing staff to rely heavily on expulsion to maintain control of clients. A closing example is offered as evidence. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Travelers are a migratory subgroup of homeless youth who may be especially prone to engaging in risky behavior. This study compared the substance use and sexual behavior of young homeless travelers and non-travelers to evaluate the extent and possible sources of travelers' increased risk. Data came from face-to-face interviews with 419 homeless youth (36.6% female, 34.0% white, 23.9% African American, and 20.0% Hispanic) between the ages of 13 and 24 years (M = 20.1 years, SD = 2.5) who were randomly sampled from 41 shelters, drop-in centers, and street sites in Los Angeles. Travelers were almost twice as likely as non-travelers to exhibit recent heavy drinking, 37% more likely to exhibit recent marijuana use, and five times as likely to have injected drugs. Travelers also had more recent sex partners and were more likely to report having casual or need-based sexual partners and combining sex with substance use. Mediation analyses suggest that travelers' deviant peer associations and disconnection to conventional individuals and institutions may drive their elevated substance use. Differences in sexual risk behaviors are likely attributable to demographic differences between the two groups. Overall, these differences between travelers and non-travelers suggest different service needs and the need for different service approaches. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - In 1999, the Ontario provincial government introduced into its high school curriculum a requirement that students complete 40 h of volunteer community service before graduation. At the same time, the high school curriculum was shortened from five years to four. Consequently, the 2003 graduating class of Ontario high school students contained two cohorts, the first of the 4-year cohorts that was compelled to complete a mandated community service requirement, and the last of the 5-year cohorts that was not. Using a quasi-experimental design, we surveyed 1768 first-year university students in terms of their perceptions and attitudes about the nature and amount of previous volunteering, attitudes towards community service, current service involvement and other measures of civic and political engagement. Comparisons of the two cohorts indicate that, while there were discernible differences between the two cohorts in terms of their past record of community service, there were no differences in current attitudes and civic engagement that might plausibly be attributed to participation in the mandatory service program. Results are discussed with relation to the current debate concerning the impact of mandatory volunteering policies on intrinsic motivation to volunteer. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - My research consisted of three years of qualitative inquiry, including 62 interviews with members of the Department of Education, school administrators, teachers and students, as well as a yearlong ethnography at a transfer school that I chose because of its history of success with the city's hardest- to-reach youth. To my knowledge, mine is the first formal study of New York City transfer schools. 'Transfer schools' are New York City's public alternative schools, which serve 'over-age, under-credited' high school students (i.e. students who are 'behind' in school). These students experience many challenges and interruptions to their education, including homelessness, incarceration, immigration, financial hardship (that can require students to work during school hours), being (teen) parents, drug addiction, and having to care for sick or dying family members, to name a few. There are presently 44 transfer schools in the city, and the overwhelming majority of students who attend them are poor youth of color. I engage existing scholarship on education policy, social reproduction, and critical race theory, and prioritize the voices of students and teachers in my analysis. In The Myth of the Unteachable: Youth, Race and the Capacity of Alternative Pedagogy, I make three main arguments. First, I describe how schools contribute to the reproduction of race and class inequalities. However, my data show that when economically disadvantaged students of color are instructed to locate their own academic 'failures' in the historical context of an education system that has consistently produced unequal outcomes, those students can learn to see the difference between their personal failures, and the failures of the school system, and this helps them to regain the self-esteem necessary to make significant educational progress. Second, I show how accountability-era (2001-present) education policies like the Bush administration's No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and the Obama administration's Race to the Top (RTT) undermine public education and especially frustrate the work of transfer schools that serve 'at-risk' youth. Contributing the case of transfer schools to extant scholarship on the more general harms of NCLB and RTT, I follow education policy from the national to the local level, describing how policies trickle down to affect individual transfer schools, teachers and students in damaging and destructive ways. Lastly, using psychoanalytic theory, I apply the concept of 'working alliance' to student-teacher relationships, articulating how these relationships affect student outcomes. In educational contexts, working alliance refers to generative and productive relationships between teachers and students. The development of a working alliance entails achieving consensus about what school is for, and how learning occurs. This requires agreement about goals and tasks, and is especially strengthened by the development of interpersonal bonds between students and teachers. I describe how working alliances can be achieved, and illustrate how the development of these alliances increased student retention and achievement.

AB  - The four substantive chapters deal, in order, with the demography and sociology of homeless populations, with models for explaining the diverse causes of homelessness, with the social and cultural organization of survival by the homeless themselves, and with a review of processes and programs which have been developed to enable and empower solutions to homelessness. In each, Glasser and Bridgman work from a fundamental assumption that approaching homelessness and making meaningful contributions to policy and program development requires a recognition that homelessness is a diverse and complex social problem which needs to be understood in all its diversity and complexity first. By focussing on a four part matrix of issues related to homelessness, the authors provide a carefully detailed and thorough "historical cartography" of homelessness which contextualizes and critiques the way homelessness has been understood and responded to.The first issue, and perhaps the most compelling, is how to define homelessness. Mainstream media, and neo-liberal politicians, have adopted a definition which ensures the lowest possible number be used to count the homeless. Glasser and Bridgman challenge the utility and explore the politics of this narrow definition by showing that homelessness needs to be understood as a condition of risk and not only the lack of shelter. By examining different definitions of homelessness world wide, they show that a more thoroughgoing and effective definition of homelessness needs to recognize that being at risk of lack of shelter, whether a family actually living on the street, or a group of street youths sharing living space in decayed rental housing, is a more effective definition. By arguing for a broadening of the definition of homelessness, they provide the critically historical context for understanding homelessness as a process which is ongoing and contingent, a key to more effective policy deliberations and implementation since it also broadens the points in the processes of shelter risk at which interventions can take place. By extending our understanding of homelessness to include an appreciation of the broader question of shelter adequacy, Glasser and Bridgman show the homeless problem to be larger and more complex than mainstream political models have been able to address.

AB  - In his one in-depth empirical application, for example, Becker explains changes in state-level per capita cigarette consumption on the basis of price and income effects.Consider the following transition into adulthood that Becker offers: A troubled teenager who begins to experiment with drugs may expect, but not be certain, that his life will begin to straighten out, perhaps because of a good job or marriage, before he becomes addicted.Since these and other choices are made under considerable uncertainty, some persons become addicted simply because events turn out to be less favorable than was reasonable to anticipate - the good job never rescued the drug user.By the end of the book, I wanted Becker to apply his rational choice model to the behavior of mutual fund managers, or even Nobel prize winners.In my own research on decision making in chess, I found that the worst players most consistently exhibit rational choice behavior and that the best players only do so when interaction was breaking down (Eric M. Leifer Actors as Observers: A Theory of Skill in Social Relationships, 1991).Since most players are not very good, and the balance that only good players seem able to sustain is extremely delicate, I could have embraced the rational choice model for its ability to explain the most actual behavior.

AB  - This study used data from a sample of 444 homeless adolescents to determine whether thoughts of death and suicide form one construct (unidimensionality) or two distinct but correlated constructs (multi-dimensionality). Thoughts of death and suicide were common in the sample; over two-thirds of the adolescents positively endorsed at least one of the eight death- or suicide-related items. Evidence regarding dimensionality was mixed. Exploratory factor analysis results and similarity coefficients supported one construct; confirmatory factor analysis and external consistency results provided evidence for two constructs. The results were reconciled by considering suicidality as a continuum from thoughts of death to suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicide. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This paper considers ethnographic investigation "at home" in reference, in part, to research carried out into youth homelessness in GB. Relations of distance & familiarity in the field, & the notion of the ethnographer as stranger, are discussed so as to advance an understanding of the purpose & practice of participant observation. The paper explores fieldwork relations in the context of urban & social exploration, & also with reference to ethnographic research with young people &/or children. In conclusion, the paper argues for recognition of difference & distance in fieldwork, not simply as obstacles to be somehow overcome but as something inevitable & necessary to the insights that fieldwork affords. 34 References.

AB  - Unhoused youth are the most understudied subculture of the homeless and little time has been spent describing their lives on the streets. The few studies that have done so have tended 'to emphasize deviance as the central quality of unhoused youth by focusing mainly on unhoused youth who were particularly deviant and/or on their participation in illicit activities. To correct this, this dissertation, based on two ethnographic projects and in-depth interviews with unhoused youth, delves into an exploration of the daily lives of unhoused youth living on the streets of Hollywood, paying particular attention to the liminal position they often occupy. Part one addresses what street life is like for the newly unhoused youth, as well as the strategies unhoused youth use to survive on the streets. It also outlines the various physiological, psychological, biographic, and interpersonal obstacles unhoused youth face when trying to leave the streets and briefly explores the commonalities among unhoused youth who successfully left the streets. Building off the details of unhoused youth's daily lives presented in part one, part two examinees the fact that unhoused youth often occupy a liminal position in society, participating in both the conventional world of mainstream society and the illicit world of the street. It begins by detailing the ways current typologies do not accurately describe unhoused youth and argues that unhoused youth are more appropriately analyzed using a continuum. Following this, the dissertation addresses the appearances, talk, and activities of unhoused youth that explicitly claim and/or align with an 'on the street' identity as well as those that explicitly claim and/or align with an 'of the street' identity. Since an unhoused youth's participation in mainstream locations and activities is often contingent, however, on not being recognized as unhoused, it also explores the various strategies they use to conceal their status as such. Then, in order to demonstrate the liminal position that unhoused youth frequently occupy, part two concludes with a series of case studies that highlight the variability in the 'on the street' and 'of the street' identity claims and alignments of unhoused youth.

AB  - The article reviews the literature on street children and points out why there are street children in certain cultures and not in others. The reasons for their existence are related to poverty, abuse, and modernizing factors. Street children are defined and distinguished from working and refugee children. Details about the family struc ture of street children are given. How the children cope and their level of psychological functioning are discussed. The article gives reasons for why the children are treated with such violence and gives attention to methodological research problems that include the children's ability to distort information, the researcher's procliv ity to under- or overestimate the children's emotional condition, distortions of facts created by the press and international organiza tions, and general cross-cultural research issues.

AB  - Stable housing is widely recognized as a prerequisite for the functioning of individuals and families. However, the housing stability of fathers is understudied, particularly for fathers living apart from their children. This analysis measures the extent and nature of fathers' housing insecurity using the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a national longitudinal survey of urban families. Housing insecurity affects a substantial portion of fathers, with 25% experiencing insecurity at least once in their child's first 9 years. However, few fathers report persistent insecurity that spans consecutive waves. Data also indicate significant differences in rates of housing insecurity between fathers living with, and apart from, the mothers of their children, with nonresident fathers far less likely to report secure housing and more likely to experience incarceration. The nature of insecurity experienced by nonresident fathers is also qualitatively different than that experienced by their coresident counterparts.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine whether abused and neglected children are at increased risk for subsequent crime victimization. We ask four basic questions: (a) Does a history of child abuse/neglect increase one's risk of physical, sexual, and property crime victimization? (b) Do lifestyle characteristics (prostitution, running away, homelessness, criminal history, drug abuse, and alcohol abuse) increase a person's risk for crime victimization? (c) Do lifestyle characteristics mediate the relationship between child abuse/ neglect and crime victimization? (d) Do these relationships vary by a person's sex or race/ethnicity? Using data from a prospective cohort design study, children with documented histories of physical and sexual abuse and/or neglect (n = 497) were matched with nonabused and nonneglected children ( n = 395), followed up, and interviewed in middle adulthood (approximate age 39.5). Logistic and ordinary least square regressions were conducted to assess risk for crime victimization and test for mediation. Child abuse and/ or neglect increased a person's risk for physical (OR = 2.56,  p< .001) and sexual (OR = 2.28, p< .001) but not for property crime victimization. For the sample overall, running away served as a partial mediator between child abuse and neglect and physical and sexual crime victimization. In addition, results revealed sex and race/ethnicity differences in patterns of mediation. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - The frequent consumption of alcohol and cannabis by youth poses both concern and ambivalence to society about the nature of the problem and how to respond. In the last few decades, social science research has devoted considerable attention to substance use among youth, making it an important issue to consider; however, controversy abounds when considering where consumption patterns of youth fall on a continuum from normal to deviant. Central to these debates is the social acceptability of the substances being used, their legal status, the frequency with which they are consumed, and the particular groups most often engaged in their use. Youth who consume alcohol are viewed with less trepidation than those who consume cannabis. Moreover, those who use either substance recreationally or experimentally are deemed to be more typical than those who have escalated their use to more regular or frequent episodes. Finally, drug-using youth who are embedded in conventional society are viewed more positively than those who occupy the margins of society, such as those who are delinquent or homeless. To fully understand the debate about the deviancy versus the normalcy of adolescent substance use, more inclusive approaches that take into account structural, individual and situational explanations are needed; however, existing studies fail to consider all of these influences. Instead, there is debate about the dominance of each of these explanations. This dissertation examines and tests these competing representations and explanations of adolescent substance use by drawing on multiple sociological theories of deviance including control theories, differential association theory, routine activity approaches, and drift theory. Using a combined sample of high school students and street youth, the findings suggest that adolescent substance use is far too complex to be explained by only one theory. Instead, explanations for the variations in substance use must take into account both individual backgrounds and more immediate situational influences. Most importantly, individual beliefs about substances are an important and often ignored aspect of individual substance use patterns.

AB  - Although a substantial body of literature demonstrates high prevalence of street victimization among homeless youth, few studies have investigated the existence of victimization classes that differ on the type and frequency of victimization experienced. Nor do we know how substance use patterns relate to victimization classes. Using latent class analysis (LCA), we examined the existence of victimization classes of homeless youth and investigated substance use predictors of class membership utilizing a large purposive sample (N = 601) recruited from homeless youth-serving host agencies in three disparate regions of the U.S. Results of the LCA suggest the presence of three distinct victimization profiles -- youth fit into a low-victimization class, a witness class, or a high-victimization class. These three victimization classes demonstrated differences in their substance use, including rates of substance abuse/dependence on alcohol and/or drugs. The presence of distinct victimization profiles suggests the need for screening and referral for differential services. [Copyright Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB  - Public programs like domestic violence shelters and family shelters are developed for a specific purpose, domestic violence and homelessness respectively. Analysis comparing two separate samples (n = 147 and n = 291) of single-female-headed families using either type of shelter found many more similarities than differences between the populations. Among the similarities are the rates of mental health and substance abuse problems, lifetime rates of victimization and trauma, and issues related to poverty, including difficulty paying bills and rent. These similarities suggest families at both types of shelters may have similar service needs, and families at homeless family shelters would benefit from the wider range of services provided to domestic violence clients, including attention to trauma and violence issues.

AB  -  This article addresses controversy over gender differences in risk and protective factors for late-adolescence assaults. A secondary analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort considered 2,552 youth aged 12 or 13 in the first survey wave. Comparison of girls and boys revealed, as expected, boys had higher levels of risk factors: early delinquency, gang involvement, and hopelessness. Girls were higher in the protective factors, parental monitoring, and school and religious ties; but boys were higher in parental support and work involvement. Negative binomial regression showed that gang exposure and hopelessness explained assaults, regardless of gender. For girls, early runaway behavior and work activity were positively, and parental monitoring was negatively, related to assaults. Unexpectedly, boys with high parental support were more assaultive than others. Prevention requires addressing negative contexts for all youth, but for girls, programs also must address conditions promoting their running away. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - A Likert-type questionnaire was used to compare 532 adolescents being detained by county juvenile authorities to 354 adolescents attending an inner-city public school in terms of the volume of delinquent activity committed for a period of 1 year prior to the survey. Four levels of delinquent activity were developed, ranging from minor offenses such as runaway behavior to serious offenses such as assault. Ss were also compared on factors associated with the inclination to commit delinquent acts (anomie, social bonding, delinquent peer association, labeling, & self-esteem). This comparison provided information on the multiple pathways to delinquency, & suggested forms of intervention. 2 Tables, 58 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this project included: to provide health education for refugees and to gather perspectives on barriers; and facilitators toward healthy eating and regular physical activity. Methods: Six health promotion classes were held between February and June, 2017. Data were collected using a pre-class survey, focus groups, and field notes. Qualitative data were mapped to constructs of the Health Belief Model. Twenty-eight participants of diverse refugee populations participated in this project, of which 12 participated in 4 focus groups. Results: Desires to “stay healthy” and “to be there for family” appeared to be key facilitators for healthy lifestyle. Key barriers to healthy lifestyle include “busy schedule,” and “not able to afford healthy food.” Participants described their struggles to access affordable fresh food and believed having adopted the American diet caused adverse health outcomes. Throughout the project, participants showed interests in utilizing local parks but lacked information on access and use. Conclusion: Future health promotion interventions should focus on familiarizing refugee families with local produce whilst being culturally sensitive on different cooking methods and diet preferences. More health classes and opportunities for free to low-cost exercise are needed.KeywordsHealth belief model; Health education; Healthy lifestyle; Refugees; Resettlement; USAKey points:What is known about this topic?•Obesity, overweight, diabetes and hypertension are common health issues within various refugee populations resettled in the United States (US).•Diet habits among refugees are largely influenced by cultural factors.•Physical inactivity is another health-related concern among refugees resettled in the US.What the paper adds?•The lack of affordable fresh food was a major barrier to healthy eating among refugees resettled in the US.•Refugees resettled in the US believed the change of environment and diet after resettlement had led to the diagnoses of certain health conditions.•Refugees resettled in the US identified health classes focusingo n eating and exercises, as well as park access as community neds.BackgroundThe United States (US) is one of the top hosting countries to offer hope and shelter for people fleeing from conflicts and persecutions [1,2]. Over 3 million refugees have resettled in the US since 1975 [2]. Prior to their resettlement in the US, many refugees spent extended periods of time in refugee camps. Commonly known conditions at camps include lack of access to clean water, lack of sufficient nutrition, poor housing conditions, and high incidents of infectious diseases [3-7]. Moreover, people who have lived in a refugee camp likely have unmet health needs and are more likely to report of chronic illnesses [8,9].Health concerns among refugees do not cease upon arrival to their host country. Several studies have investigated changes in health status among refugees after they have moved to the US. Such studies found that obesity, overweight, diabetes, and hypertension to be common health issues within various refugee populations resettled in the US [10-13]. Since children often rely on their parents for food consumption, many refugee children may also be at high risk for overweight and obesity. One study found the prevalence of overweight and obesity among refugee children increased from 17.3% to 35.4%, from initial intake to year 3 post-resettlement, surpassing the prevalence rate for USborn children at the time of the study [14]. One contributing factor may be that diet habits are largely influenced by cultural factors [15]. Physical inactivity is another health-related concern among refugees. For instance, the lack of familiarity of how to adopt an active lifestyle in a new country is a common barrier to being more physically active [16]. Findings from prior research warrant a need for further research and health education to promote healthy lifestyle within refugee populations to prevent undesirable health outcomes such as hypertension and obesity [12,14,17].This project utilized the Health Belief Model (HBM) to explore barriers and facilitators to healthy lifestyle. The HBM posits people’s beliefs toward barriers and benefits of a health promotion action, together with perceived susceptibility and severity of a health problem, and explains individuals’ engagement with preventive health behaviors [18]. The HBM has been successfully used to tailor interventions and to understand beliefs toward health behaviors [19-21]. However, previous studies that examined barriers and facilitators to healthy lifestyle among refugees have focused mainly on specific ethnic groups, or were conducted outside of the US [22-24]. Studies which implemented healthy lifestyle programs with broader refugee populations in the US are lacking.This paper describes a project that was designed for and implemented to refugees from diverse backgrounds. As opposed to limiting from a certain region, this project accepted participants from any country of origin to maximize practical significance for future health promotion development. The purpose of this project was two-fold. First, the project aimed to provide health education on healthy lifestyle for refugees, and then to gather the information about their perceptions on barriers and facilitators toward healthy eating and regular physical activity.MethodsSettingThis project was carried out at a community college campus in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, which is frequently used for workshops and other services for individuals with a refugee background. This project included the provision of healthy lifestyle classes, observations of the classes, focus groups and a brief survey. This study was approved by the University of Utah Institutional Review Board (IRB number 00091780).Participants and recruitmentParticipants were individuals over 18 years of age who moved to the US with a refugee background. Research team members recruited participants at a community college where classes and focus group took place. Flyers were posted on campus to increase exposure of the class and focus group. The combination of flyers and word-of-mouth (i.e., from resettlement agency staff to potential participants) allowed for the project to include a diverse pool of participants. Consent was obtained from each participant.Data collectionThis project utilized multiple sources of data including focus groups, survey, and field notes to ensure data validity and methodological triangulation. The richness of data from multiple sources enhanced the interpretive status of data and strengthened the study findings [25]. All data were collected between February and June 2017.Throughout all stages of this project, research team members provided interpretive assistance for participants who may have needed it. Together, team members were able to provide assistance for participants who spoke the following languages: Arabic, Burmese, French, Karen, Poe Karen, and Somali. Approximately half of all participants needed language assistance on filling out the surveys, as well as during classes and focus groups.ProcedurePre-class survey and class evaluationBefore each class, participants were asked to fill out the preclass survey on demographics as well as eating and physical activity habits. Toward the end of the class, participants were asked to fill out a class evaluation survey to identify areas of improvement for future classes. Participants were then invited to stay in the same classroom for the focus group.Class and field notesEach healthy lifestyle class lasted approximately 30 minutes. Class content included the discussions of the health benefits of different foods, as well as recommended portions for each food. A variety of physical activities and tips on adding more activities were discussed (e.g., taking the stairs instead of using an elevator). The majority of the class materials were pictures shown on a projector, followed by handouts with pictures for tips on balanced eating for participants to take home. Handouts included illustrations of different food groups and were intended to remind participants to consume more fruits and vegetables. Classes followed a discussion-based format to encourage engagement of the participants. Starting in the third class, resistance band exercises were incorporated as group activity during class.Field notes were taken by one or two undergraduate/graduate students with a background in health education during classes and focus groups. Field notes focused on group dynamics (i.e., interactions between participants and instructor), questions and concerns expressed by participants, responses that were specific toward the constructs of the HBM, and the environment of the classroom (i.e., noise level). The notes were utilized to maximize the richness of data and offered multiple perspectives for data interpretation.Focus groupsInitially, six focus groups were scheduled. Due to participant availability, the project included six classes and four focus groups. Focus groups were designed as one-time only. In other words, each participant was allowed to participate in only one focus group. The focus groups were semi-structured and followed a focus group guide with 14 questions guided by the HBM. For example, “What good, and how, would eating healthier bring to you and your family?” Other questions include “What would stop you from adding more physical activity to your daily activities” and “What would stop you from eating healthier?” The focus group questions were developed by the facilitator and two key informants of the target population to ensure openness and appropriateness of questions to fit diverse backgrounds. The key informants were also on-site as interpreters throughout the project. Each audio-recorded focus group lasted approximately 20-40 minutes.IncentivesFresh fruits and healthy snacks were provided during a class and a focus group. At the end of the focus group, individual bags of dried beans and brown rice (approximately 1 pound per bag) were available for participants to take home. Additionally, each participant received a small gift valued at approximately $1 (i.e., first aid kit, kitchen towel).Data AnalysisSurvey data were initially entered into Excel Spreadsheet and analyzed using SPSS version 22. Audio-recorded files were transcribed. Field notes and focus group data were entered into Microsoft Word for open coding analysis.Emergent themes were coded, categorized, and mapped to the constructs of the HBM using the constant comparative method [26]. During open coding, tentative labels were created as patterns emerged. Field notes were utilized to compare and cross-check with focus group data during open coding throughout data analysis. Findings are reported through a narrative inquiry using participants’ own explanations of events and beliefs. Quotations and short phrases are presented to represent findings through participants’ own descriptions of their experiences.ResultsPre-class survey resultsParticipant characteristics: In total, 28 adults with a refugee background participated in this healthy lifestyle project. The average length of stay in the US was 6 years and 4 months (Table 1). The mean age was approximately 36 years of age and 43% of participants had received some college education or higher. Additionally, the majority (93%) had stayed at a refugee camp prior to their resettlement in the US. The average household included three adults and two children. Participants came from different parts of the world with various language(s) spoken at home. Nepali (36%), English (18%), Arabic (11%), and Somali (11%) were the most common languages spoken at home. Other languages included Dinka, French, Kinyarwanda, Sinhalese, and Swahili, which were spoken by participants from Rwanda, South Sudan and Sri Lanka. Some participants reported they spoke more than one language at home.Characteristics Frequency PercentageGenderFemales 8 29%Males 20 71%Age18-35 13 46%36-55 10 36%56+ 4 14%Unknown 1 4%Highest Education CompletedLess than High School 8 29%High School 8 29%Some College 7 25%College Degree 2 7%Graduate Degree/Professional Degree 3 11%Occupation*Student 7 25%Working Full Time 15 54%Working Part Time 4 14%Looking for Work/Unemployed 3 11%Retired 3 11%Receive Government Assistance ProgramYes 14 50%No 12 43%Maybe/don't know 2 7%Stayed at Refugee CampYes 26 93%Language Spoken at Home**Arabic 3 11%English 5 18%Nepali 10 36%Somali 3 11%Other 7 25%Self-identified EthnicityBhutanese 4 14%Congolese 2 7%Nepali 9 32%Somali 4 14%Sudanese 4 14%Other 5 18%* Participants were asked to select all that applied** Participants were asked "What language do you speak at home?" Some spoke more than 1 language at home. Table presents data collected from 22 class participants, 6 participants did not respondTable 1: Demographics of class attendees (N=28).In general, participants reported their health status between “good” and “very good.” The majority responded their health was “good” (n=13), followed by “excellent” (n=7), “very good” (n=5), “fair” (n=2), and “poor” (n=1). Most participants reported eating three meals a day (n=13) while some reported two meals per day (n=12). Additionally, most participants reported use of “vegetable oil/liquid margarine,” “don’t use MSG,” and limited use of “salt” and “sugar” when preparing meals at home.Approximately 64% participants reported purchasing food of their country of origin (i.e., at a local ethnic food store). On average, participants exercised 4 days per week. The average score was 4 when asked “how important is it for you to follow a healthy-eating diet” on a scale of 1 to 5 (i.e., 1 being “not at all important” and 5 being “very important”). An average score of 4.6 was obtained when participants were asked “how important is it for you to exercise regularly each week” on the same scale of 1 to 5.Field note resultsGroup dynamics and class environment: Class size remained small. Participants sat in a circle during class and focus group. Almost every class began with some distractions and then got quiet which facilitated more focus toward the class. Examples of common distractions include chatter between participants and noise from other classrooms or the hallway even after the classroom door was closed. Participants who spoke English tended to be more engaged and shared more experiences than those who relied on an interpreter. Group dynamics seemed to be at most engaging (i.e., having most attention and engagement from participants) during (1) class activity, and (2) when a participant began sharing thoughts or experience which often prompted sharing from other participants.Questions and concerns from participants: Participants asked questions across topics covered and not covered during class. Topics included different levels of sugar in various kinds of fruits, benefits of certain food groups, where to look for green space (i.e., parks and trails), and how find their ethnic food. Many participants expressed concerns about the lack of affordable healthy food in general (e.g., fresh food) and specific foods from home country (e.g., camel milk), which were also emphasized in focus groups. There were inquiries on locating affordable organic food. Participants also expressed interests in having more exercise opportunities.Focus group resultsPerceived susceptibility of not adopting a healthy lifestyle: Among the 28 participants of this project, 12 participated in the focus groups. In general, participants believed they did not exercise enough, while many participants acknowledged the importance of regular physical activity. The majority of the participants gave simple and concise responses such as “yes [don’t have enough exercises]” and “I feel like I'm not having enough activities.” Some participants elaborated their responses with what their beliefs were the reasons for example, one participant said “I don’t have enough exercise. I feel like I don’t have enough time for exercise, I work.” Another participant stated “yeah, I understand that the exercise is very good for your health and I can’t, I couldn’t do it, because [of recovery from] surgery…I am not able to do [exercise].”Perceived severity of not adopting a healthy lifestyle: When asked how serious of an impact of insufficient regular exercise and unhealthy on health, a wide range of possible negative outcomes were discussed, including “die early,” “more likely to get a disease,” “family start worrying about you,” “not feeling good,” and “missing work.” For instance, one participant stated:There are different problems. There are a lot of problems when it comes to eating. If you don't eat healthy, you just keep doing the same thing and [gain weight] and not exercising and [become] lazy. I think fast food is the reason. (Male, Group 1)Others gave specific examples for adverse health outcomes, such as “diabetes” and “high blood pressure.”One participant also responded “unable to provide for the family” as a negative result from not keeping up with healthy eating and regular exercises. For example,If a person does not eat well nor exercise, that person will not be able to provide for the family. Not staying in shape and not eating healthy can make a person become lazy and they can easily get sick. This negatively affects the family’s income because the adult would not have the energy to go to work. Financial issues arise [too]. (Female, Group 3)Perceived benefits of healthy lifestyle: The most commonly reoccurred themes for benefits of healthy lifestyle were “good health,” “health benefits” and “disease prevention.” Health benefits included “clean your system,” “sweat more” and “have more energy.” One participant also related eating healthy and exercising regularly can help bring more awareness to one’s needs.The good thing about keeping track of your health, eating a balance diet and exercising regularly is that you’re more aware of your body’s needs. If a person does not exercise nor pay attention to their diet, they tend to be lazy and eat junk food every day. They lose control of their appetite. That’s why eating healthy and exercising is important because then you’ll have energy and [you’ll be] able to control what you can and cannot eat, you pay close attention to what your body needs. (Female, Group 3)Several participants also reported “sweating” and “blood circulation” as health benefits from having regular exercise. “Feel better” or “feel good” were other commonly referred benefits from exercising. For example, one participant shared “if I don’t exercise, I have pain in my knee, joint…if I do exercise, I feel better.” Another participant said:Eating healthy and exercising…prevent the individual from getting any [disease]…such as diabetes and blood pressure. Exercising is also good for the person’s mental health. Especially since we’re elders, we need to pay extra attention to what we eat, eat food with more vitamins and such. It is very important for everyone to eat healthy and stay active. (Female, Group 3)Perceived barriers to adopt a healthy lifestyle: “Financial reasons” emerged as a major barrier to eating healthy. For instance, one person stated “not being able to afford it, money is something that can prevent you from eating healthy food.” Some also stated “healthy food cost more,” “[being] busy” and “fast food is cheaper” as barriers to healthy eating.Lack of free time was revealed as a key subtheme relating to not having enough regular exercise. “Time,” “work” and “take care of kids” were common responses when asked about what prevented participants to exercise. One participant replied “my husband has two jobs” as the main reason for less time to go on walks together. Another participant described spending time doing exercises as a “waste of time” in lieu of doing other things. This participant further explained: “I think time is very important…the schedule of job, professional job and…[house chores]. You could waste two days a week [by spending time doing exercises].” Another participant also said: “come  [work] in morning…and we finish [work at] 5 O’clock…house clean, go shopping, do laundry…all of those problems, [take a] long time [to finish].”Several participants also mentioned “being sick,” “being injured” and “procrastination” as barriers to having regular exercises. In general, participants described procrastination as “laziness.” Described by one participant, “Procrastinating or you know lazy… keep saying…gonna [exercise] later but later never come.”Cues for actions and self-efficacy: There was a general consensus in “staying healthy” as a key motivator to eat healthy and exercise regularly. Specifically, when asked “what would help you stay motivated to have a healthier diet,” participants repeatedly referred to their desires to “to stay healthy” and “motivation for exercise.” One individual stated, “If we eat healthy… we’re better… [have] more energy, more strength…eating healthy helps to [motivate] to exercise more.”Some individuals also referred their desires to “feel better,” “prevent diseases,” and “wanting to live long for family” as reminders to eat healthier. Participants also shared a belief about having more financial security would help them eat a healthier diet. For example, one participant said “When I have money, I can eat good, because I have money.” Another participant also said “Maybe every time I have money, I can eat good.”When asked to identify ways that “would be helpful to keep you motivated to have regular exercise,” participants generally responded with “stay healthy.” One participant suggested the use of a calendar as a reminder to what he would eat. This individual said, “For example, if you have a calendar, like set up a schedule for every day, like Monday, you eat [certain food]…[eat different food for]Tuesday…[eat different food on] Thursday…have it in front of you on the refrigerator, that makes me not forget what to eat.”Overall, participants provided positive outlooks when asked “how likely are you to take action and lead a healthy life?” One participant responded with “very common” and other responses were “common” or “I try.” For instance, one participant implied she tries to exercise despite the difficulty to exercise after long work hours: “After eight hours of work…get home very exhausted…I have an indoor bike, I try to exercise at least an hour when I can [using the indoor bike].”Another participant shared his positive view about how every day of his can be led by a healthy lifestyle:For me, every day is, can be [led with a healthy lifestyle]. You can take a schedule…it means that we take time to exercise…maybe 20 or 30 minutes [each day]…take time for other activities, share with family members…I think we have four dimension to be fit with body. Social dimension, intelligent dimension, physical dimension, and belief dimension...to combine…the four dimensions, we [can] be better every day. (Male 3, Group 1)Cultural differences in eating habits and exercises: Throughout the focus groups, participants repeatedly mentioned their struggles in finding affordable “fresh” ingredients and their frustration regarding a “lack of fresh foods.” Participants further distinguished between the two with the former being “it costs more” to buy healthy foods and the latter being “you can’t buy” because certain foods were simply not available near where they lived. Many individuals longed for specific food such as “African vegetables,” while others missed having “fresh milk,” “camel milk,” and “fresh fruits” and “meat from home.” For example, one participant stated, “The things they eat over there [South Sudan and Kenya], like the dishes they make, you can’t find it here. You can’t buy…certain types of meat that you can’t just grab or find at [local grocery stores].” Another participant also shared her frustration with a change in diet:In my country, we used to drink fresh milk. Straight from the cow or the camel. But you can’t find that right here, so all the food we eat here has GMOs. I don’t want to eat it but I have no choice…we could’ve bought fresh, organic food [but] it’s expensive [here]. (Female, Group 3)Some participants also believed that the adoption of an American diet might have been associated with certain health conditions such as “diabetes,” “loss of teeth,” and problems relating to “blood pressure” and “cholesterol.” For instance, one person stated:In my opinion, the food I have been eating in my country and the food I eat here are very different. The foods we have been eating in my country were organic [and] fresh. When I was in my country, I didn’t have diabetes, blood pressure, [and] cholesterol [problems]. But now that I’m in [US], [doctors] telling me I have diabetes. I think the reason why I’m diagnosed with diabetes has to do with the food here not being organic and fresh. (Female, Group 3)Many participants shared their opinions on “every food is sweet” in the US. The thought of American food being “too sweet” was widely acknowledged and considered as a problem. One participant shared “here [US] food is very sweet.” Another participant summarized her opinion about American food and food from home as the following: “…here…every food is sweet…for example…you try American chicken, it is totally different [referring to freshness and taste]…African chicken is very delicious and very healthy…I just don’t eat chicken from here [US], because I feel like I can get sick.”Another cultural difference identified by the participants was the “change of environment.” One participant stated “I think the physical exercise[s] are the same, but we have a problem of change of environment…for example, in my country we have more mountain[s] you can walk by foot.” This participant’s experience was echoed by other participants, for instance, one participant elaborated further: “You [could] go to the forest…you can go by foot on the road in Africa.” Participants’ explanation on “change of environment” may suggest a decreased amount of exercise after having moved to the US, which could be a result of change in their built environment and a change in mode of transportation.When asked if participants have experienced discrimination in the US, the majority responded “no,” except two male participants. Both participants described having felt excluded since moving to the US. One person said “For African people, the discrimination can't come with an activity but with sociality” while the other person stated “If you don't c[o]me from [places where] people that are already playing in the park, they don't let you go and play with them and join them.”Needs expressed by participants: In general, participants expressed interests in attending healthy lifestyle classes in the future. For example, one participant said “I really appreciate this class…we really needed…health class for exercise and it’s something that’s really needed.” In addition to health classes, participants also indicated the lack of knowledge about park access and trails. For instance, one participant said “…about the access to the park...is it free? Or must [we] pay?...we have no information about the access.”Class evaluation survey resultsOverall, participants gave positive feedback about the health class. For instance, 10 out of 12 participants reported “very high” or “high” for their level of interest in topics discussed in class while two people said it was “average.” Half of the participants thought class length was “just right” whereas four people thought class time was either “too little” or “far too little.” All participants thought the content of the class were “excellent” or “good” and rated “excellent” or “good” for the instructor’s preparedness of the class. When asked “do you plan on using what you learned from today’s class,” 11 out of 12 participants reported “yes.” The majority (n=9) also reported that they were confident to do something that they learned from class, though one person reported “no” while another person responded with “maybe/don’t know.”DiscussionThis healthy lifestyle project provided health education on healthy eating and regular exercises, and gathered perspectives and health believes about a healthy lifestyle from the participants with a refugee background. Overall, participants knew the benefits of a healthy lifestyle and were aware of a wide range of possible adverse effects if one did not eat healthy and exercise regularly. Nonetheless, most participants acknowledged they could do better with their current eating and exercise habits. This study has three main findings. First, the lack of affordable fresh food was a major barrier to healthy eating. Second, participants believed the change of environment and diet after resettlement was related to chronic health conditions. Finally, participants identified health classes focusing on healthy eating and exercises, as well as park access as community needs.One recurring theme throughout different classes was high price or nonavailability of fresh foods in the community. This finding suggests that participants may have lived in a food desert. Food deserts affect any resident of the areas, though low income residents, especially those with limited transportation options, face even more obstacles in accessing affordable fresh food. The challenge in accessing affordable healthy food portrays the experiences of food insecurity. Prior research has identified this particular challenge among resettled refugees in the US [27,28]. For instance, one study found that food insecurity was experienced by approximately 3 in 4 participants among refugees resettled in the US [28].The change of diet and environment after resettlement have also made direct impacts on the lifestyle of refugees. In this study, participants reflected they had more opportunities to walk before living in the US. Physical activity such as walking is often was a part of daily living prior to resettlement in developed countries. The conception of exercise and body movement may be different between their countries of origin and in the US. One study with Somali refugees revealed that physical activity was incorporated into their daily lives and that the concept of walking for health did not exist in Somalia [29]. This study also concluded that the concept of physical activity as leisure was unfamiliar to people from Somalia. Regarding diet change, one study with refugees from Cambodia found that those who have experienced severe deprivation were more likely to consume a high-fat diet and to be overweight or obese during post-resettlement [30]. While our study did not explore the presence of food insecurity prior to resettlement in the US, participants generally believed that adopting the American food culture had led them to eat not as healthy as they did before coming to the US. The process of acculturation to American culture and behaviors is also a possible risk factor to develop chronic diseases for refugees, though this possible risk factor may be offset by utilizing available proper resources in the host country that were inadequate in their country of origin [31,32].While the availability of food and food culture certainly affects one’s decision-making about food, it is also possible that there is a lack of information on identifying locally grown food (i.e., in-season food at stores) that is both healthy and easily accessible. Focus group data suggest a general consensus that American food is unhealthy and that participants found American food to be unappealing because they were unfamiliar with healthy American food ingredients. This finding is similar to those of another study with refugees and service providers that indicated the lack of knowledge of food in the US contributed to poor food choices among recently arrived refugees [33]. In a different study, over half (58%) of the participants with a refugee background have expressed uncertainty toward whether they were eating the “right food” in the US [34]. Diverse habits of cooking meat and vegetables may be one area to focus on in future health classes. Although participants have repeatedly pointed out their difficulty in accessing fresh ingredients for cooking, the preferred method of how they actually prepare meals was not thoroughly explored. Health promotion programs for refugees should build upon existing positive health practices. Furthermore, cultural factors such as cultural beliefs about healthy eating should be further explored and incorporated into future health promotion classes.Overall, health classes and class activity (i.e., elastic resistance bands) received positive feedback from the participants. Participants acknowledged the importance of health education and urged for healthier lifestyle classes for their communities. Future health promotion classes should continue to be offered at a location where refugees are already familiar with; this is relevant as offering culturally sensitive classes and workshops at a familiar site is an effective method to disseminate health-related information for refugees [33]. Moreover, more educational interventions on nutrition and physical activity are necessary for refugees and immigrants in the US [35,36]. However, little is known about specific health promotion needs among diverse refugee populations who experience various environmental and geographical factors depending on resettlement locations in the US. For instance, refugees resettled in a smaller city may have different health promotion needs from their counterparts living in a metropolitan city. More research is needed to identify specific barriers and enablers to healthy lifestyle experienced by different ethnic groups or geographic regions.LimitationsThis project has several limitations. While the focus groups gathered important perspectives, the sample size was small. Some individuals were unable to participate in this study due to language barriers. Since the majority of the participants were from Africa, the data of this study could be skewed toward perceptions of refugees from the African region. Although nearly all participants reported they would use what they learned in class, this project did not include follow-up to determine the impact of a class on actual health behavioral changes.ImplicationsThe results of this project bring valuable insights for the further development of health education classes for refugees. Future health classes with refugee populations should focus on providing health education regarding how to eat healthy using locally available food while acknowledging culturally appropriate eating habits. Moreover, their own cultural methods of cooking should be considered in future health education curriculum. Classes incorporating more tips and demonstrations of various forms of physical activity for different physical conditions are potentially helpful for people with different needs. More available resources for free or low-cost physical activity are also needed in their community. Additionally, cultural and religious values must be carefully considered for future health promotion classes. A culturally “safe” place may be useful for promoting exercise classes for refugees to accommodate different cultural values [37]. For instance, an all-women group exercise class in a room with coverings for windows for people with Islamic beliefs; this allows women to freely participate in a group class without worry of men walking by or look into the class from outside of the classroom. Most importantly, future education interventions must consider that individual’s lifestyle choices are shaped by more than culture, but the intertwining of varying factors including personal beliefs, cultural values, and environmental factors [15,33]. More research is necessary for developing tailored interventions to improve the overall wellness of refugees, as well as follow-ups to examine effectiveness of such interventions.ConclusionThis study provides insights about beliefs toward healthy eating and regular exercises among refugees resettled in the US. While the benefits of a healthy lifestyle were widely acknowledged, some less-healthy eating habits and a sedentary lifestyle remained. Financial reasons and lack of available time were main inhibitors for people to engage with healthy eating habits and physical activity. Increasing the availability of affordable healthy foods and opportunities for physical activities in refugee communities are essential for developing an environment that encourages residents to have a healthy lifestyle.Ethical ApprovalThe University of Utah Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved this study.FundingThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project was supported by the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programs at the University of Utah (Talon Harris and Kai Sin).References1.

AB  - The study investigated the effect of length of homelessness, (less than three months as against six months or longer), on four variables: self-esteem, depression, locus of control & social supports. Respondents, (50 homeless adolescents, 25 male & 25 female, aged between 16 -- 21), completed four questionnaires. Multivariate Analysis of Variance indicated that a combination of the four variables was dependent on the length of homelessness. The short-term homeless group reported significantly higher levels of self-esteem & significantly lower levels of depression compared with the long-term homeless. Furthermore, the long-term homeless group scored towards a more external locus of control, as compared with the short-term homeless. While no significant difference was found between the two groups in the number of social supports, the short-term homeless group reported significantly greater levels of satisfaction with their social supportiscuss the implications of these findings.

AB  - This paper investigates children's experiences of hyperdiversity in public spaces in inner city and suburban neighbourhoods in Auckland, New Zealand. As children walk through, and talk about, their everyday places of play and mobility they sense and reveal material and relational diversity in the places and people they encounter. We examine temporal and affective changes in children's experiences of familiar places when in the presence of strangers - older youth and homeless people. We draw on walking interview and/or focus group data gathered from children aged 9-12 years living in socio economically and ethnically diverse neighbourhoods. Declining rates of physical activity and independent mobility in children and calls for urban spaces that nurture children's agency and wellbeing provide the research context. Ideas of enabling places are adapted to explore the way constructs of otherness, inclusion and difference can be fortified through social and material expressions of hyperdiversity in the urban landscape. We explore the contention that how children and adults behave, identify and feel within particular urban spaces arises from everyday encounters and affective relations with place itself. In so doing, we seek a conceptual broadening of place as an enabler of children's mobility, agency and wellbeing.

AB  - Homeless youth are a vulnerable and understudied group who has consistently reported elevated levels of substance use. Understanding the factors associated with substance use within this population may help guide future intervention efforts. Although few studies have examined the role of abstinence self-efficacy and coping in substance use among homeless youth, some research indicates that higher abstinence self-efficacy and greater use of task-oriented coping are related to lower substance use, while greater use of emotion-oriented and avoidance-oriented coping are related to higher substance use. Accordingly, the current study examined the relationship between abstinence self-efficacy, coping, and substance use among homeless youth, while controlling for the effects of age, gender, and ethnicity. A sample of 40 homeless youth (ages 17 to 24) was recruited from the only drop-in center in a Midwestern city. Data were obtained at one point in time, and included information regarding abstinence self-efficacy, coping, and frequency of alcohol and drug use. A series of hierarchical regression analyses were conducted. In order to control for the effects of age, gender, and ethnicity, these variables were entered in the first step, and abstinence self-efficacy and coping were included in the second step of analysis. A significant relationship was found between abstinence self-efficacy and alcohol and drug use. Specifically, higher abstinence self-efficacy was related to lower alcohol and drug use. Additionally, an interaction between abstinence self-efficacy and substance use was found in which African American, compared to non-African-American youth, reported reduced alcohol use as their level of abstinence self-efficacy in social pressure to use increased. However, coping was not associated with substance use. The current study provides empirical support for the relationship between abstinence self-efficacy and substance use among homeless youth. The findings have practical implications. Although a longitudinal design and an intervention trial is needed to confirm, increasing abstinence self-efficacy through intervention efforts may be an effective strategy for reducing substance use among these youth.

AB  - This study combines interviews, questionnaires, journaling, mental mapping, and a participatory action research (PAR) project to examine the lived experiences of Hispanic  immigrant youth as they navigate the labor market. Research questions address how youth are transitioning into the workforce in an age of labor insecurity, anti-immigrant sentiment and policy; what the challenges are; and how the youth propose to improve their job access. Attention is paid to how differences in documentation status, and other demographic and neighborhood variables, affect job access and how youth perceive their opportunities. Applying a mixed-methods, multi-scalar approach, this study captures how the personal and the local interconnect with the institutional at the local, state and national level. How youth operationalize and deal with their documentation status on a day-to-day basis is spatially contingent. Lack of documentation status is a factor that intersects with but tends to override other personal, household, and neighborhood characteristics. DACA has profound benefits on undocumented participants’ lives but it is not enough to secure their future. There is a lack of understanding about immigration policies and statuses by youth and their families, and employers, which can reduce job opportunities for non-citizen youth. Also, many Latino/a youth, regardless of their status, face stereotyping and discrimination at work, school, or in public spaces, based on their ethnicity. This impacts their work access, confidence, and aspirations. Family expectations and support are key in motivating and encouraging youth to work hard and achieve their dreams. Youth are also able to leverage their bilingualism, biculturalism, and "immigrant" determination in professional situations. In the face of challenges, youth present agency and resilience. The PAR project and avenues for change offered by youth support the idea that youth themselves know best how to improve their labor market opportunities, and they should be involved in the creation and implementation of these initiatives. Lastly, this study furthers our discussion about immigrant integration and segmented assimilation, and demonstrates how Hispanic youth experience socio-spatial labor market inclusion and exclusion.

AB  - Individuals from minority groups in the United States have been found less likely than non-Hispanic whites to participate in research studies. The recruitment and retention of individuals from minority groups has also proved challenging. We describe the challenges that we encountered in recruiting and retaining a sample of severely mentally ill Mexican and Puerto Rican ethnicity for a study of the context of HIV risk. We recruited women in San Diego County, California and northeastern Ohio who were between the ages of 18 and 50 and who had diagnoses of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression. We identified challenges to recruitment and retention at the macro, mediator, and micro levels. We were able to retain 81.1% of the Puerto Rican cohort and 26.7% of the Mexican cohort over a 5-year period. The vast majority of barriers to recruitment and retention within the Puerto Rican cohort occurred at the micro (individual) level. Macro level barriers occurred more frequently and impacted retention to a greater extent within the cohort of Mexican women. Our experience underscores the importance of outreach to the community and the interaction between staff and individual participants. Diverse strategies are required to address the impact of migration on follow-up, which may vary across groups. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Although the consequences of the Great Recession are extensively discussed in previous research, three critical issue need to be addressed in order to develop a full portrait of the economic experiences of children during this period. First, given the changing immigrant composition of the US child population, new studies are needed for examining the implications of immigrant status for exposure to child poverty during the recession. Second, it is important to understand how traditional patterns of racial inequality among were transformed during the years of the recession. Finally, it is not clear whether recession-related changes in socioeconomic inequalities continued to have implications for child well-being in the post-recession period. Results from this analysis indicate that the adverse effects of the recession were most intense in states with significant changes in their populations of Black and Latino immigrant children. The results further show that declines in parental work opportunities were more consequential for poverty among Whites and Asians. The analysis also finds differential implications of family contexts for child poverty among Black immigrant and natives during the recession. Finally, the results indicate that increases in racial child poverty disparities during the recession did not disappear in the years following the downturn.

AB  - The article describes a study carried out with a representative sample of homeless people in Madrid (Spain; N = 188). This study aims to corroborate the relationship identified in the literature between stressful life events and suicidal behaviour in a group in a situation of social exclusion, to assess the differences in the number and characteristics of stressful life events experienced by homeless people who are attempters and non‐attempters, and to identify which combination of stressful life events enables discrimination for suicide attempts among homeless people. The results show that 30% of homeless people in Madrid had attempted suicide, and 57.9% of them had done so for the first time when they were homeless. The interviewees are shown to have experienced a large amount of stressful life events, with substantially more stressors experienced by the homeless people who tried to commit suicide, during both their childhood and adolescence and throughout their life. Finally, we found that the combination of 7 stressful life events provided the best possible discrimination between homeless attempters and non‐attempters.

The objectives of the program were to provide housing for drug-dependent persons without linkages to nuclear families & to reintegrate the person with social & family (collective) life. The sheltered setting was staffed by professionals & volunteers, & offered the youth education in a number of academic & personal areas. Demographic & behavioral data on 1992 residents (N = 33) are presented, & differences between 1989 & 1992 residents are noted.

Even more scarce has been knowledge that addresses the challenges and barriers faced by 21st century researchers engaged in ethnographic data collection amidst culturally diverse populations. The present work has addressed these gaps in the literature by detailing the personal, methodological and cultural challenges encountered by this researcher in a larger study which utilized a mixed method design to investigate homeless street youth in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Results indicated the need for social workers to possess an awareness of their own limitations and biases as it may relate to cultural differences. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This study reports on the characteristics of street youth in treatment in Ontario. Data came from eleven substance abuse treatment programs. It was found that street youth in treatment had a larger number of social and drug abuse problems than did non-street youth. They were more likely to be unemployed, on welfare, and to have legal problems. They had more depression and lower self-esteem, and use more alcohol and drugs. Discharged street and non-street youth had similar lengths of stay and drop-out rates in one residential program and similar, although limited, amounts of treatment in outpatient programs. However, street youth were more likely to leave outpatient programs without telling staff. The need for more experimentation in the provision of service for youth is identified.

Homeless men appear at greater risk of exhibiting symptoms. Nonetheless, homeless women report more symptoms, a result consistent with general population trends. Predisposing illnesses were the most accurate predictors of the number of reported symptoms, but gender explained a significant amount of variation in reported symptoms after other health risks were controlled. The findings inform the debate on the relative importance of biological factors, acquired risks, illness perception and behavior, and reporting bias in explaining why women report more symptoms in survey research. It appears likely that female reporting bias and gender differences in illness perception are underestimated in general population surveys because even under extreme conditions, men are less likely than women to report symptoms.

AB  - In recent years, popular media has drawn attention to "mean girls" and their negative treatment of others, particularly other females. But while the attention to girls' aggression and their mistreatment of their peers highlights understudied aspects of female behavior, it neglects the beneficial aspects of female friendship. We argue that compared to relationships with males, friendships with females provide more social control, fewer opportunities and less motivation for offending and may therefore discourage crime. Because an adolescent's gender likely influences the association between the gender of one's friends and crime, we anticipate that the association will be stronger for females than for males. The relationship is also likely affected by the context in which relationships originate; we expect that those that develop in less conventional contexts will have weaker effects on crime. We explore these hypotheses with a comparative analysis of effects of friendships on property crime in two samples of youth: those who live at home and attend school and those who are homeless and spend their days and nights on the street. Our findings support our hypotheses. The relationship between female-dominated friendship networks and property crime is negative and significant; however, this association is strongest for school females, weaker for school males and females who live on the street, and nonsignificant for homeless males.

AB  - I was looking at some regression results with a research assistant last week. The RA had been preparing administrative data from a jail, and I was interested in the correlates of returning to incarceration among those who were released. The big challenge in this analysis was simply cleaning up administrative records that were not generated for statistical analysis. Data cleaning had taken several months. We were eagerly awaiting these first regressions, and I wanted to look at basic demographic patterns: race and sex differences in reincarceration. The first regressions we ran also controlled for age, criminal offense, and county of jurisdiction. The initial output indicated that blacks were more likely to go back to jail than whites and that men were more likely to return to custody than women. Unexpectedly, the results indicated that older people were more likely to return to jail than younger people. This contradicted the age-crime curve, the universal finding that criminal offending declines with age. Hmm. I asked the RA to pull up the coding of the age variable, but in the meantime I was thinking about why people older than 40 were more likely to return to incarceration than those in their 20s. Jails, more than prisons, incarcerate people who face a lot of social and economic insecurity. Problems of homelessness and mental illness are highly prevalent. Perhaps enduring needs for drug treatment and housing among older people explained their high rates of reincarceration. Just then, my RA announced that she had found the problem with the age code and fixed it. We fit the regression again. Now, the rate of reincarceration declined smoothly with age, just as expected. A lot of data analysis looks like this. We begin with some intuitions about what patterns we will see in the data. But often, expectations are fairly weak, and if the data point in a different direction, we sort through an infinite catalog of post hoc explanations to make sense of the results. A lot of sociological data analysis does not involve the testing of a well-specified null hypothesis, but it is an iterative and inductive process of learning from data. Prior information is diffuse, and we readily invent explanations for unusual findings, at least for a few minutes in the privacy of our offices. The article by Muñoz and Young (this volume, pp. 1–33) offers one approach to the problem of learning from data in a context with weak prior information. They consider model uncertainty in the familiar applied situation in which interest focuses on one predictor in a regression analysis, but the researcher is unsure which control variables to include in the model.

AB  - This study examines prostitution, homelessness, delinquency and crime, and school problems as potential mediators of the relationship between childhood abuse and neglect (CAN) and illicit drug use in middle adulthood. Children with documented cases of physical and sexual abuse and neglect (ages 0--11) during 1967--1971 were matched with non-maltreated children and followed into middle adulthood (approximate age 39). Mediators were assessed in young adulthood (approximate age 29) through in-person interviews between 1989 and 1995 and official arrest records through 1994 (N = 1,196). Drug use was assessed via self-reports of past year use of marijuana, psychedelics, cocaine, and/or heroin during 2000--2002 (N = 896). Latent variable structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test: (1) a four-factor model with separate pathways from CAN to illicit drug use through each of the mediating risk factors and (2) a second-order model with a single mediating risk factor comprised of prostitution, homelessness, delinquency and crime, and poor school performance. Analyses were performed separately for women and men, controlling for race/ethnicity and early drug use. In the four-factor model for both men and women, CAN was significantly related to each of the mediators, but no paths from the mediators to drug use were significant. For women, the second-order risk factor mediated the relationship between CAN and illicit drug use in middle adulthood. For men, neither child abuse and neglect nor the second-order risk factor predicted drug use in middle adulthood. These results suggest that for women, the path from CAN to middle adulthood drug use is part of a general 'problem behavior syndrome' evident earlier in life. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Children living in households that have recently become food insecure may be particularly vulnerable to adverse weight and dietary changes, but longitudinal studies examining these associations are lacking. Using data from 501 Head Start preschoolers from Michigan (48% male) who were followed during one school year as a part of a randomized obesity prevention trial, we examined changes in children's adiposity indices and dietary quality according to changes in household food insecurity. Household food insecurity change status was categorized as persistently food secure, became food secure, persistently food insecure, or became food insecure. Linear mixed effects models were used to estimate relative changes in BMI-for-age z scores (BAZ), triceps skinfolds-for-age z scores (TAZ), or diet quality (assessed with the 2010 Healthy Eating Index) over the school year according to food insecurity category. We found that girls from households that became food insecure over the year had a 0.21 unit higher gain in BAZ than girls from households that were persistently food secure, after adjustment for potential confounders (95% CI 0.02 to 0.39, p = 0.03). Girls from households that became food secure had improvements in dietary quality over the year compared to girls from persistently food insecure households (adjusted difference in Healthy Eating Index score change = 9.1 points; 95% CI 3.0 to 15.0; p = 0.003). There were no statistically significant associations with changes in TAZ. Among boys, there were no associations between changes in household food insecurity and changes in BAZ, TAZ, or dietary quality. In summary, we found that BMI and diet quality changes of Head Start preschool girls were correlated with short-term changes in household food insecurity. Continued research efforts should focus on identifying the most effective ways to promote the health of children in food insecure households, especially those who may have recently transitioned or are transitioning into food insecurity.

AB  - A census of homeless youth was conducted in locations across Los Angeles County, California. Building on previous research that has focused on homeless youth in cruise areas, the authors examined demographic and behavioral differences between homeless youth in cruise and noncruise areas. Youth in cruise areas were more likely than youth in noncruise areas to be older, to have been away from home longer, to have recently visited community-based agencies, and were likely to have resided in shelters and less likely to attend school. These data suggest possible selection bias in earlier studies that relied primarily on homeless youth from cruise areas. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Changes in the US food system and an interest in changing dietary habits among youth have impelled numerous schools and communities to develop programs such as community gardens. Youth community gardens have the potential to positively influence dietary behaviors and enhance environmental awareness and appreciation. However, actual data supporting youth gardening and its influence are limited. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of community gardens on youth dietary behaviors, values and beliefs, and cooking and gardening behaviors. Focus groups were conducted with inner-city youth living in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota and compared those involved in a youth garden program with those uninvolved in order to investigate whether the gardening program influenced their habits, beliefs, and values. Findings indicate that youth garden program participants were more willing to eat nutritious food and try ethnic and unfamiliar food than those not in the program. Additionally, it was apparent that garden participants had a stronger appreciation for other individuals and cultures and were more likely to cook and garden on their own than youth not involved in a garden program. The findings suggest that garden programs positively impact youth garden habits, food choice, social skills, nutrition knowledge, and cooking skills. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - In examining the discourse among homeless body-pierced youth known as 'gutterpunks,' the paper explores narrative of opposition & unity. By analyzing conversations on the streets of New Orleans, derived through interviews conducted during the filming of the documentary Gutterpunks, the author deconstructs major themes of their daily struggle for survival. Because most research involving discourse analysis [DA] asserts that action, rather than social structure, is the prime influence in determining identity construction; the paper attempts to provide evidence to the contrary by distinguishing how emotions are communicated in the context of institutional & noninstitutional settings. To that end, four persistent themes of discourse were extracted & measured based on their perceived lack of status, their profoundly transient nature, their perception of oppositional forces in their lives, & the importance of group membership to combat their problems. These themes were investigated for inherent differences found in institutional identity construction processes (derived from drop-in center interviews) & noninstitutional identity construction processes (derived from street interviews). Evidence suggests that identity fluctuations & related actions (assessed qualitatively & quantitatively) are attributable primarily to the environment.

After controlling for diagnosis and other factors, we found that African Americans were less likely than whites to receive mental health counseling and psychotherapy, but more likelythan whites to receive pharmacotherapy. We also found that substance abuse clinics were more likely than primary care and specialty mental health clinics to provide mental health counseling and psychotherapy. However, specialty mental health clinics were the only clinics to provide pharmacotherapy. Future research should examine racial disparities in a variety of settings, controlling for diagnosis as well as other factors.

AB  - Utilizing a sample of 300 homeless street youths, the research examines the individual-level sub-model of Baumer's interpretation of Merton's anomie theory. The paper explores the role the interaction between monetary goals and weak commitment to legitimate means plays in the generation of instrumental crime and the manner in which this interaction is itself moderated by blocked opportunities, monetary dissatisfaction, social modeling, cultural support, and the perceived risk of punishment. The findings reveal that a weak commitment to legitimate means, but not monetary goats, has a lower order impact on the willingness to commit instrumental crime. These two variables, however, do not interact to predict intentions to offend. Instead the findings reveal that blocked opportunities and higher levels of monetary dissatisfaction moderate the relationship between the monetary goals and weak commitment to legitimate means interaction and the willingness to offend. Findings are discussed and suggestions for further research are offered. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - While there is a growing body of research on intimate partner violence (IPV) experienced by the housed youth population, a limited amount is known about IPV experienced by homeless youth. To our knowledge, no previous studies have examined how homeless youths' experience of IPV is related to their social network, even though the social networks of homeless youth have been shown to be significant indicators of health and mental health. The purpose of this study is to understand the relationship between IPV, gender, and social networks among a sample of 386 homeless youth in Los Angeles, California. Results revealed that one fifth of the sample experienced IPV in the past year. Stratified regression models revealed that IPV was not significantly related to any measure of male social networks; however, females who experienced IPV had more male friends (Beta = 2.03, SE = 0.89, p < .05) than females who did not experience IPV. Female homeless youth who witnessed family violence during childhood had more male friends (Beta = 2.75, SE = 1.08, p < .05), but those who experienced sexual abuse during childhood had fewer male friends (Beta = -2.04, SE = 0.93, p < .05). Although there was no significant difference in the rate of IPV victimization across genders, the context of this abuse appears to be drastically different. The results suggest that females with more male friendships are at greater risk for exposure to IPV. To date, there are few effective youth-targeted IPV prevention programs and none have been shown to be effective with homeless youth. These results provide insight into future program development.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests chronic household food insecurity has an adverse effect on health. This study examined the prevalence, predictors and health outcomes associated with food insecurity in 100 migrant and seasonal farmworker (MSFW) households living on the U.S.-Mexico border. Data were collected using the U.S. Food Security Scale, California Agricultural Worker's Health Survey, and objective anthropometric, clinical and biochemical indicators. Food insecurity affected 82% of households; 49% also had hunger. Household food insecurity was predicted by the presence of minor children in the home and low maternal education. Food insecure households were more likely to have at least one member affected by symptoms of depression (deprimido), nervios (an ethnospecific condition), learning disorders, and symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal infection. Although not directly associated with food insecurity, adult obesity, central body adiposity, elevated blood pressure, and blood lipid and glucose disturbances were common. These findings highlight the significant food security and health challenges faced by border area MSFW families. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

Comparison of responses by groups revealed no significant differences in personality variables, but considerable variation in social background, the homeless youths being much worse off than even the rockers. The backgrounds of many included such problems as alcoholism in the family, low income, large families, broken homes, delinquency, & overcrowded living quarters. Although testing revealed approximately equal intelligence levels among the 3 groups, the homeless did less well at school. 5 Tables. Modified HA.

AB  - Theoretical analyses by anthropologists suggest that food and water insecurity exhibit multiple conceptual parallels, hold similar consequences for wellbeing, and lead to analogous coping strategies aimed at mitigating those consequences. However, these deductions largely originate from studies conducted separately on either food or water insecurity. Thus, these similarities may not bear out when examined in populations facing high rates of both. In particular, some researchers argue that food and water insecurity exert independent but nonetheless iterative effects on mental wellbeing. Others hypothesize that food insecurity mediates the relationship between water insecurity and mental health, especially in agricultural communities. However, relevant studies are limited, and none test this hypothesis in urban areas. Moreover, no data exist on water insecurity and mental wellbeing in adolescents, which hampers comparative analyses of youth resource insecurity. In addition, resource buffering-a long-discussed coping strategy-remains contested with respect to food insecurity and effectively untested with respect to water insecurity. The buffering hypothesis suggests that adults cushion younger household members against resource inadequacies via tradeoffs that yield gender- and age-based disparities in intrahousehold resource distributions. For example, adults may forgo food quality, quantity, or variety in favor of children. It stands to reason that adults similarly buffer children against water scarcity, but, again, this has not been examined. Conducted December 2016-April 2017, this cross-sectional survey included 650 mothers, fathers, boys, and girls living in the slums of Jaipur, India. When controlling for food insecurity, the relationship between water insecurity and psychosocial stress (Perceived Stress Scale-10) was eliminated; water insecurity's effect on anxiety and depression (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-10) remained significant for fathers only. These findings are consistent with the mediation hypothesis. Moreover, pursuant to the buffering hypothesis, parents generally reported more severe resource scarcity than their children; however, girls reported slightly worse water insecurity than fathers.

Drug use was verified by urinalysis. Results indicate that 23% were homeless (living in the street or in shelters), & no significant differences were found in the use of DAT & NEP by place of birth or by adolescent exposure to NY or the island. However, homelessness (as an indicator of extreme poverty) significantly decreased the likelihood of utilization of DAT & NEP. Further research on how to assess socialization to mainland & island cultures in relation to drug use & HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) risk behavior is needed, along with analyses of the effects of homelessness on service utilization & identity factors specifically related to OAT & NEP utilization.

AB  - Causal attributions of homelessness may affect both the design and acceptance of public policies aimed at improving the situation of homeless people and the strategies that homeless people themselves decide to adopt in order to cope with their situation. This article analyzes the differences in causal attributions of homelessness based on gender, age, nationality, educational background, perceived social class, evolution of personal economic situation, and future expectations between the members of 2 groups: (a) "homeless group", consisting of a representative sample of homeless people in Madrid, Spain (n = 188); and (b) "domiciled group", consisting of a sample of people in Madrid at no risk of homelessness (n = 180), matched for sex, age and nationality. Results show that among domiciled population, women, older people, those without university education, those considering themselves to belong to lower income social classes, those who considered their economic situation to have worsened, and those who expressed negative expectations for the future attributed homelessness to individualistic courses to a greater extent. Meanwhile, among homeless group, younger people, those without university education, those considering themselves to belong to higher social classes, those who perceived their economic situation as having improved in recent years, and those who expressed positive expectations for the future generally attributed homelessness to individualistic courses to a greater extent.

AB  - Coalitions and alliances are core aspects of human behavior. All societies recognize alliances among communities, usually based in part on kinship and marriage. Aggression between groups is ubiquitous, often deadly, fueled by revenge, and can have devastating effects on general human welfare. Given its significance, it is surprising how little we know about the neurobiological and hormonal mechanisms that underpin human coalitionary behavior. Here we first briefly review a model of human coalitionary behavior based on a process of runaway social selection. We then present several exploratory analyses of neuroendocrine responses to coalitionary social events in a rural Dominican community, with the objective of understanding differences between in-group and out-group competition in adult and adolescent males. Our analyses indicate: (1) adult and adolescent males do not elevate testosterone when they defeat their friends, but they do elevate testosterone when they defeat outsiders; (2) pre-competition testosterone and cortisol levels are negatively associated with strength of coalitionary ties; and (3) adult males usually elevate testosterone when interacting with adult women who are potential mates, but in a striking reversal, they have lower testosterone if the woman is a conjugal partner of a close friend. These naturalistic studies hint that reciprocity, dampening of aggression, and competition among friends and allies may be biologically embedded in unique ways among humans.

AB  - Street-involved youth experience high rates of alcohol and other drug use, which put them at risk for other health-related problems including substance dependence, infectious diseases, drug overdose and victimization. There is limited research on gender differences in poly-substance use among street-involved youth. In this study of 150 street youth in Toronto, Canada, we explore the effects of gender, health and social factors on alcohol and other drug use. Multivariate regression analyses were used to create models predicting the number of substances (alcohol and illicit drugs) used in the last 30 days before interview. The mean number of substances used by the female and male street youth was 2.1 and 2.5, respectively, with up to seven used in total. Multivariate analyses showed that different factors were associated with poly-substance use for female street youth compared to male street youth. These results highlight gender-specific factors to be considered in developing preventive approaches and supportive services for homeless youth with substance use problems.

AB  -  The effectiveness of five tracking strategies (collateral contacts, Internet databases, driver's records, letters, and community visits) used in attempting to locate homeless and housed adolescents 4.5 years after they were first contacted was examined and compared. The study sample comprised 401 adolescents (252 homeless and 149 matched housed) from 8 counties in Southeast Michigan. Homelessness was defined as sleeping in a shelter, at a friend's home without parental permission, or on the streets for at least 1 night within 1 month before initial contact. We successfully located and interviewed 85% (n=340) of our sample at the 4.5-year time point. The most effective tracking procedure was collateral contact, which was important in locating 43% of participants in this study, followed by Internet databases (18%), community visits (11%), driver's records (6%), and letters (6%).

AB  - The present study compared 532 adolescents being detained by country juvenile authorities to 354 adolescents attending public school in reference to the volume of delinquent activity committed for a period of one year prior to the survey. Four levels of delinquent activity were developed, ranging from minor offenses such as runaway behavior to serious offenses such as assault. Participants were also compared on how they responded to several Likert-type questions that measured factors associated with the inclination to commit delinquent acts (anomie, social bonding, delinquent peer association, labeling, and self-esteem). This comparison provided information on the multiple pathways to delinquency which suggested forms of intervention.

AB  - Moral, efficiency, and rights-based arguments have sparked widespread acknowledgment in both academic and policy circles that children deserve a special focus in poverty measurement. Children can be considered to have a "differential experience" of poverty in childhood, setting their situation apart from adults as well as from other children depending on their life stage. The European Union (EU) is among those bodies that have recognized the need for child-focused indicators in monitoring poverty and social exclusion and is currently in the process of developing, testing, and comparing single indicators of child well-being across member states. In this article, we seek to add to this debate by providing a micro-analysis of the breadth of child poverty in the EU by analyzing the overlap of deprivations across monetary and multidimensional indicators of poverty. Thereby, we aim to gain insight into the breadth of child poverty and degree of overlap between measures of monetary and multidimensional poverty in the EU. Particular attention will be paid to the investigation of cross-country and cross-domain differences. Using the 2007 wave of the EU-SILC data, we compare the EU monetary "at-risk-of-poverty" indicator to a range of child deprivation indicators at the domain level in four EU member states (Germany, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom). Overall, the article's findings provide a strong call for the need to take a multidimensional approach toward the measurement of child poverty in the EU context. Size and group differences between children faced with income poverty and/or deprivation in other domains are considerable and underline the need to take a broader perspective to identify those who are vulnerable. Overlap analysis of income and domain poverty suggests considerable mismatch across the board, regardless of the particular country under consideration. This suggests a considerable breadth of child poverty in the EU, meaning that deprivation in monetary and non-monetary terms does not seem to be concentrated on a few particular groups but rather spread out across the population, with large numbers of children likely to face deprivation in a few domains. Although dependent on the domain and country under consideration, single parenthood, living in a rented dwelling, low work intensity, and income poverty are found to be significantly and considerably the risk to poverty.

AB  - Current statistics on AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) in the adolescent population are misleading, because of the long time lag between infection with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) & diagnosis of AIDS, & because counting of AIDS cases underrepresents the presence of infection. Recalculation of the AIDS infection rate among adolescents in New York City (NYC) yields a 0.5%-1.0% prevalence of infection, a higher rate than currently seen. Those infected are clustered in certain areas, & tend to be heterosexual poor & minority adolescents. Adolescence is normally a highly sexually active period, & one in which experimentation with sex & drugs takes place; the adolescent illusion of invulnerability to disease makes uninformed & unprotected sex a likely occurrence. In NYC, the populations of adolescent runaways, prisoners, & street children are even more likely than normal adolescents to be exposed to AIDS through drug involvement. The NYC pattern of increasing adolescent AIDS cases may be repeated in other urban areas in which AIDS is already highly prevalent. This pattern implies that public policy should stress universal AIDS, drug, & sex education in the schools, community programs for out-of-school youth, early identification & entry into clinical care for adolescents, & tailoring of care services for adolescents.

AB  - There has long existed the notion that girls are the beneficiaries of chivalrous treatment in juvenile justice processing. This notion has not been thoroughly tested. Prior research has primarily focused on the earlier stages of juvenile justice processing (i.e., arrest and intake stages) or explored gender differences in dispositions merely in terms of youths' likelihood to receive one of three outcomes: dismissal, probation, or incarceration. The current study instead evaluates gender differences within a population of youths who received severe sanctions to assess the accuracy of whether girls are treated more leniently than boys in juvenile justice processing. The study sample includes all youths in Florida sentenced to the state's highest-security level programs for their first juvenile commitment between July 1, 1994 and June 30, 1998 (n = 9,380; 958 females and 8,422 males). Analyses focus on the extent to which girls are less serious offenders than boys similarly sanctioned. Both legal and extra-legal variables are examined to evaluate offender seriousness and provide a contextual framework within which to assess the system's response to girls. The research findings support the study hypothesis that girls are not treated more leniently than boys. Instead, girls were committed for significantly less serious offenses and had less extensive prior records than boys. Girls were also perceived as more mature and more aggressive and were more often classified as runaway risks. In the context of extra-legal factors, a significantly greater proportion of the girls than boys were residing with families perceived to be functioning poorly, were not attending school, were perceived as aggressive in school, were suffering from medical problems, were abusing multiple substances, and had previously attempted or threatened to commit suicide. Multivariate analyses were conducted to examine whether gender would remain significantly related to legal and extra-legal variables after controlling for race. The inclusion of race in most instances strengthened gender differences. The overall conclusion is that girls are not afforded chivalrous treatment in juvenile sanctioning. Instead, they continue to be differentially processed by a patriarchal juvenile justice system focused more on their underlying problems than their delinquent behaviors.

AB  - In 1993, the French National Instit of Demographics (MD) in Paris started a research program on homelessness, combining in-depth interviews of homeless people & service providers, & several statistical surveys of the Paris homeless, the two main ones being a survey of 591 homeless adults (1995) & a survey of 461 homeless youth aged 16 to 24 (1998). The methodology of those surveys was close to the one used by several American studies, namely the Urban Instit 1987 national survey, the RTI 1991 survey of the Washington, DC, homeless & the Bureau of the Census 1996 national survey of homelessness. Hence, some comparisons are possible. This report focuses on two issues. First, drawing on the examples of the homeless in Paris & the US, I will discuss the problems of international comparisons which arise from differences in methodology, definitions, field of the surveys, etc, making the elaboration of comparable results difficult; & from differences in policies designed to relieve poverty, to help homeless people, to deal with immigration or mental illness, etc, also making interpretation difficult. Second, I will examine the use of triangulation from statistical surveys & in-depth interviews, with examples taken from our research program. This last question will be mostly dealt with from the standpoint of someone conducting a statistical survey, but the contribution of quantitative data to qualitative investigations will also be investigated. 10 Tables, 96 References.

AB  - Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) populations exhibit elevated rates of psychiatric disorders compared to heterosexuals, and these disparities emerge early in the life course. We examined the role of exposure to early-life victimization and adversity -- including physical and sexual abuse, homelessness, and intimate partner violence -- in explaining sexual orientation disparities in mental health among adolescents and young adults. Data were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, Wave 3 (2001-2002), a nationally representative survey of adolescents. Participants included gay/lesbian (n = 227), bisexual (n = 245), and heterosexual (n = 13,490) youths, ages 18-27. We examined differences in the prevalence of exposure to child physical or sexual abuse, homelessness or expulsion from one's home by caregivers, and physical and sexual intimate partner violence according to sexual orientation. Next we examined the associations of these exposures with symptoms of psychopathology including suicidal ideation and attempts, depression, binge drinking, illicit drug use, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse. Finally, we determined whether exposure to victimization and adversity explained the association between sexual orientation and psychopathology. Gay/lesbian and bisexual respondents had higher levels of psychopathology than heterosexuals across all outcomes. Gay/lesbian respondents had higher odds of exposure to child abuse and housing adversity, and bisexual respondents had higher odds of exposure to child abuse, housing adversity, and intimate partner violence, than heterosexuals. Greater exposure to these adversities explained between 10 and 20% of the relative excess of suicidality, depression, tobacco use, and symptoms of alcohol and drug abuse among LGB youths compared to heterosexuals. Exposure to victimization and adversity experiences in childhood and adolescence significantly mediated the association of both gay/lesbian and bisexual orientation with suicidality, depressive symptoms, tobacco use, and alcohol abuse. Exposure to victimization in early-life family and romantic relationships explains, in part, sexual orientation disparities in a wide range of mental health and substance use outcomes, highlighting novel targets for preventive interventions aimed at reducing these disparities.

AB  - Future expectations of youth surviving on the streets of Porto Alegre, Brasil, were examined. The sample consisted of 35 boys and 34 girls aged 10-18 (M age 14.4) who participated in a sentence completion task and semi-structured interviews. Responses to two incomplete sentences regarding the future revealed a mismatch between hoped-for and expected events. When completing the sentence, "In the future, I hope..." the majority of youth gave optimistic (but generally non-specific) responses. In contrast, the sentence "For me, the future..." elicited more pessimistic responses. Few gender or age-related differences emerged. Findings are discussed in light of prior research with general populations of adolescents as well as studies of street youth. Taken as a whole, results suggest that life on the street shapes and constrains how youth see their futures. Implications of the findings for policy makers and practitioners are addressed.

AB  - Lebanon is a small country whose citizens are religiously diverse. It is accommodating 1.5 million refugees from Arab countries. Child poverty is a serious social problem, for it affects child development and has negative outcomes for all children affected. Youth poverty constrains youth achievements. Some 1.35 million Lebanese are living below the poverty line, and there are more than 1,500 street children, most of whom are Syrian refugees. High unemployment is another serious social problem, with an estimated 18.7 percent of males and 24.7 percent of females being unemployed. Unemployment among youth leads to lower levels of happiness and well‐being and to feelings of not being accepted in society. Youth unemployment is also associated with drug and alcohol use as well as higher incidences of criminal and antisocial behaviors. The problem of youth is worsening in Lebanon because of Arab youth refugees, but, at the same time, the Lebanese government has not set out any comprehensive and appropriately designed policies that meet Lebanon's specific social, economic, and political problems being experienced.

AB  - Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exacerbated multiple stressors for caregivers of children in the United States, raising concern for increased family conflict, harsh parenting, and child maltreatment. Little is known regarding children's perceptions and experiences of caregiver stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective To examine how children and adolescents identify and experience caregiver stress during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We analyzed 105 de-identified helpline text and online chat transcripts from children under age 18 who submitted inquiries to the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline from March to June of 2020, with COVID-19 as a presenting issue. Inductive, thematic analysis was used to identify how child helpline users: 1) perceived and experienced drivers of caregiver stress and 2) used words to describe manifestations of caregiver stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Children experienced multiple drivers of caregiver stress during COVID-19, including intrapersonal (e.g. caregiver health concerns), interpersonal (e.g. parental discord, perceived dislike of child), and extrapersonal (e.g. financial insecurity, sheltering in place) stressors. Regardless of the driver, caregivers' stress was internalized by children. "Anger," "control," and "blame" were most commonly used to label manifestations of caregiver stress, which were often externalizing behaviors, including yelling, name calling, and blaming of others. Conclusion In text and online chat inquiries to a national child helpline during the COVID-19 pandemic, children described multiple drivers of caregiver stress, often feeling as though they were to blame. Providers serving children should address household stress spillover effects by including caregivers and directly acknowledging children's concerns using their own words.

AB  - Few effective methods of intervention exist for youth at risk for negative life outcomes. One method used successfully with both adults with chronic mental illness and adults with substance abuse problems is strengths-based case management (SBCM). Based on the principles of strengths theory, SBCM aims to assist individuals in identifying and achieving personal goals, with an emphasis on the case manager-client relationship and client self-determination. In the current study, the authors report findings from a feasibility study that implemented SBCM with adolescent runaways. Challenges to implementation, such as financial status, the role of families, abuse and neglect, developmental issues, education, peer relationships, and transportation, are examined. The current findings suggest that it is feasible to successfully implement SBCM with adolescents, but the challenges to application are different with this group compared with adults, given the developmental differences between adolescents and adults.

AB  - The present study addresses the issue of economic insecurity and its relationship with the reproductive plans of 5,358 Italian women in couples who have recently had their first child. Data were sourced from the ISTAT Sample Survey on Births, 2005 edition. This article's originality lies in the conceptualization of economic insecurity and the investigation of its effects on fertility intentions. We propose to capture economic insecurity by considering both the insecurity associated to the two partners' employment status and a variety of aspects that contribute to the household's ability to cope with possible unpredictable future events. Then, we investigate whether and how economic insecurity shapes the fertility intentions of women over their entire reproductive life span. With specific respect to women who intend to have one additional child only, we also observe the effect of economic insecurity on their intention to give birth sooner (i.e., within the next 3 years) or later. Our data show the existence of a critical factor in the passage from the generic fertility intentions to the contingent plan to have a child in the next 3 years: only half of women with one child who intend to follow the two-child family model feel ready to plan to have a second child in the next 3 years. The study also reinforces an argument that is frequently made: fertility intentions over the entire lifetime are less conditioned upon contingent constraints, and are often more closely related to individual traits and/or preferences.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Numerous studies have examined locus of control and self-efficacy as predictors of individual differences in the human experience including unemployment, health, homelessness, occupational choice, and academic performance. Most of these studies have found that control over life outcomes and judged capability to perform a given action influence future goals and attainment including outcomes in education, work skills, labor market experience, and demographic characteristics (such as fertility and marriage). In contrast, most of the current research on the socioeconomic attainment of welfare recipients focuses on human capital characteristics and family background variables. What is largely overlooked in the welfare literature is an analysis of how self-beliefs formed and measured early in life influence future goals and attainment. This dissertation examines the effects of locus of control and self-efficacy on the likelihood of welfare use, five-year outcomes, and wages of former welfare recipients using data from the 1979 through 2000 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). Binary logistic regression estimates confirm that social psychological characteristics formed early in life are initially related to welfare use. As expected, women with external locus of control and low occupational self-efficacy are more likely to receive welfare than those with an internal locus. While the social psychological predictors do not appear to have strong or robust direct effects on welfare outcomes past initial entry or on socioeconomic attainment five years following an initial exposure, occupational self-efficacy provides a notable exception. The effects of classical predictors of welfare outcomes, human capital and family background characteristics, appear to have the strongest effects on the likelihood of ever receiving welfare, five-year welfare outcomes, and socioeconomic attainment. Results of this study suggest that more research on the effect of social psychological predictors on welfare outcomes and long term socioeconomic attainment of welfare recipients should be conducted where changes in locus of control and self-efficacy using a domain-specific construct are measured after initial exposure to welfare. As it stands, the results of this dissertation have important implications for the current welfare system, especially concerning time restrictions and self-sufficiency goals.

AB  -  Coresidence of elderly parents and adult children is a special form of intergenerational relations that is not uncommon in European societies. Why do adult children and parents live together? In what way do individual characteristics, family structures, and cultural contexts play a crucial role? How can differences between countries be explained? Are there discrepancies between adult generations sharing the same household and those who live in separate homes within the same building ("near coresidence")? The empirical analyses reported in this article are based on the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. The findings prove the importance of individual needs and opportunities of children and parents as well as the relevance of family structures. Country comparisons show that welfare-state arrangements have a substantial effect. In fact, coresidence appears to be a response to economic insecurities at both individual and societal levels.

AB  -  Loach's films have often focused on labor issues. One of his best-known works, the seriocomic Riff Raff (1993), is set on a nonunion London construction site where luxury condominiums are being built. In Riff Raff, Loach's London is a harsh, class-bifurcated city where the homeless sleep in doorways and eat ravenously out of garbage baskets, and sullen, unemployed, drug-dealing young men permanently inhabit the staircases of dismal, graffiti-filled housing projects. The workers on the building site are a variegated group of exploited Liverpudlians, Glaswegians, native Londoners, Africans, and West Indians who labor under false names and insecure and life-threatening conditions without any redress. By the film's climax, two of the men's fury with the working conditions is so great that they burn down the partially completed building. The camera lingers heavy-handedly on the raging flames and rats fleeing the fire--a quasi-anarcho-syndicalist affirmation of class war, stemming more from Loach's political vision than from the social consciousness of the film's characters.Bread and Roses takes place in Los Angeles. The film is based on the ongoing Justice for Janitors campaign organized by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). It's Loach's first American-made film, and he centers it on a feisty, sharp-witted, bilingual illegal Mexican immigrant, Maya (Pilar Padilla), who turns into a militant unionist over the course of the film. (In two of Loach's earlier films, Land and Freedom (1994), set during the Spanish Civil War, and Carla's Song (1996), set in Nicaragua during the contra-Sandinista conflict, he creates passionate, albeit sentimentalized, heroines that are models for Maya.)Bread and Roses contrasts markedly with the few Hollywood films that have dealt with labor unions and labor conflict. Like Elia Kazan's On the Waterfront (1954), such films have often portrayed the unions as not much different from organized crime. Or they have subordinated an exploration of the union ethos to personal dramas depicting the redemption of alienated, adolescent characters like On the Waterfront's Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando). In the 1970s, Hollywood produced three films that focused on the labor movement. Two of them, Paul Schrader's Blue Collar (1978) and Sylvester Stallone's F.I.S.T. (1978), reduce everything that is wrong with the union movement to criminality. It's not that a number of unions weren't corrupt--it's just that crime and violence are much easier to translate into Hollywood genre formulae than films that explore other weaknesses of the union movement, such as the sense of privilege and complacency sometimes visible in union officers and their alienation from the rank and file.

AB  - The delivery systems for caring for dependent children have undergone a radical transformation in Reform-era China. Beginning in the mid-1980s, a dramatic resurgence in the number of abandoned infants as well as homeless youths from rural to urban areas placed great strains on the existing framework of state-run institutions for the young. China's Civil Affairs branch has responded to the crisis by embracing a policy of 'multi-approachism'[CJK characters removed.] that places primacy on local experimentation and initiative. Civil Affairs workers have expressed the need to 'societalize'[CJK characters removed.] social welfare work, in which the government works hand-in-hand with both outside organizations and Chinese families to provide a better future for at-risk children. These findings suggest that societalization has led not to the privatization of services or the withdrawal of the state, but rather to the formation of creative partnerships between government and nongovernment entities in aiding the dependent child. Throughout the post-Mao period, we can also observe a paradigmatic shift from institution-based care to a family-centered approach that aims at providing the disadvantaged youngster with the warmth and love of the kin unit.

AB  - This article argues that street children studies (SCS) has reduced its central concept to a discursive construct, and the young street people themselves to capable 'agents'. One consequence is that street children are not recognized as distinct intergenerational groupings in society. The traditional history of SCS as saga of science elides its positionality as activist critique. This dominant paradigm emerges as overarching belief structure and storytelling tradition, in which the presentation of correct and useful science is crucial. Taking the activist critique as a variant of post-development theory, this article traces different forms of discursive determinism, deconstructionism and populism. Using an iconic text as test case, the article reviews in detail the deconstructionist and populist arguments regarding the complexities, politics and images of street children. Opportunities to think sociologically are identified throughout. Discursive determinism relates to the narrow focus on childhood; intergenerational approaches help to go beyond discourse and competence. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Juvenile delinquent boys in Israel were used to explore the concept of 'family attractiveness' suggested by M. Gold (Status Forces in Delinquent Boys, Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1963) as a possible variable in juvenile delinquency. A comparison was made between the delinquents & other youngsters who had formerly engaged in delinquent activities but had discontinued these involvements (at least officially). Positive feelings for families were expressed by both groups; however, more positive terms were used by those youths who had given up delinquent activities. An important difference between the two groups was indicated in the percent of runaway cases, which was significantly higher among the 'continuing' delinquents. Modified HA.

AB  - Until there are sufficient resources to end homelessness in the United States, communities will struggle with how to allocate limited homeless services. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requires communities to establish a coordinated assessment system using a standardized tool to prioritize services.1 Until recently, the most widely used tool was the VI-SPDAT (Vulnerability Index-Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool) for single adults or a modification for youths and families.2 The tool assesses individuals' level of vulnerability across their history of housing and homelessness, individual risk factors, socialization and daily functions, and wellness. It then prioritizes people with the highest scores for permanent supportive housing, those with intermediate scores for short-term, rapid-rehousing subsidies, and those with the lowest scores for minimal services. Typically, use of the VI-SPDAT conflates risk assessment with allocation of services, where only the vulnerability score is used to match people to housing and services. The tool has been criticized as invalid and unreliable3 and racially biased,4 but also defended as predicting returns to homelessness.5 There is little justification for the cutoffs between recommended housing options (although, frequently, communities lack sufficient resources to follow these recommendations). Ultimately, widespread concerns led the VI-SPDAT's creators to stop supporting its use.2 This change requires communities to confront both empirical and ethical questions that the availability and near field-wide adoption of a tool, however flawed, allowed them to avoid. To aid communities as they confront these questions, we discuss three issues central to the design of a coordinated assessment processes: risk assessment (what should count as risk?), prioritization (who should get services first?), and matching (who should receive what?). In addition, we draw on bioethical frameworks for allocating scarce medical interventions to inform decisions.

AB  - Experts in the fields of child development, psychology, and criminology agree that family system variables play a key role in the development of delinquent and other deviant behaviors. Professionals in the field of substance abuse estimate that there may be at least 22 million children who have been or are currently being raised in homes with substance-abusing parents. Many studies have documented the relationships between being raised in such an environment and a variety of emotional and deviant characteristics. These individuals have been found to suffer from low self-esteem, depression, anger, and a variety of acting-out behaviors. This study investigated the differences between incarcerated juveniles from substance-abusing families and those from non-substances-abusing families. Significant differences were found in the areas of family violence, abuse; runaway, and self-reported substance abuse.

AB  - There is a growing concern over juvenile delinquency in the United States, especially with respect to serious and chronic offending. While the rate for juvenile offenses increases during adolescence, most of this increase is due to adolescents who experiment with delinquent behaviors; they don't persist in this behavior into adulthood. There is a small percentage (approximately 8%) of juvenile offenders, however, who persist in their criminal activity and who ultimately account for over half of the total crime committed by juveniles. Since this is a population that is of great concern to juvenile justice agencies, it is important to be able to recognize chronic offenders and experimenters. In order to identify chronic offenders from experimenters at the point of first offense, many juvenile justice agencies have adopted risk assessment screening procedures. While there has been much research on risk factors that can partially predict future juvenile crime, the current risk assessments aren't flawless. This study reviews research on risk factors and explores the process of resilience through protective factors, in order to expand the understanding of chronic juvenile delinquency and its desistance. More specifically, the risk factors in this study include criminal history and institutional commitment, age, drug and alcohol use, parental control, learning and school discipline problems, runaway behavior, and negative peer influence. The protective factors were based on the subscales of Behavior and Emotional Rating Scale (BERS), which include interpersonal strength, family involvement, intrapersonal strength, school functioning, and affective strength. By including protective factors along with the risk factors into the assessment process, juvenile justice agencies may be able to better assess which youths are more likely to persist in delinquency throughout their lives and design better interventions for serious and chronic juvenile offenders. The results of this study supported the protective (or additive) effect of resilience, but not the interactive model. Both risk factors and family-involvement protective factors were able to predict completion of an intervention for first-time juvenile delinquents, recidivism for the delinquents, and seriousness of subsequent crime. The implications for procedures for juvenile probation assessment and intervention are discussed.

AB  - Obesity is a growing public health concern and is more prevalent among low-income and minority populations. Food insecurity may increase the odds of obesity in children. We investigated the association between food insecurity and obesity among low-income, Hispanic, mother-child dyads (n = 74). The United States Department of Agriculture 18-item Household Food Security Survey was used to determine food security status. The majority of households were food insecure (74 %) and one-third (30 %) of children were obese. Food insecurity increased the odds of childhood obesity (OR 10.2; 95 % CI 1.2, 85.5) with stronger associations found within households where mothers were also overweight/obese compared to normal weight (p-for interaction < 0.05). Rates of household food insecurity and childhood obesity were high among this low-income Hispanic sample. Future studies should elucidate the mechanisms through which food insecurity impacts childhood obesity.

AB  - Over six million children who reside with a single mother and have a father who lives elsewhere are food insecure. This study examines the effectiveness of two aspects of nonresident father involvement, in-person visitation and financial contributions, in reducing food acquisition problems using data from the National Survey of America's Families. We find that frequent visits by nonresident fathers are related to a reduced likelihood that the resident mother's household will experience indicators of food insecurity. The effects of child support receipt on reducing food acquisition problems, however, are less consistent. Our results support policies designed to recognize and encourage nonresidential parents to make both monetary and nonmonetary contributions to the lives of their children. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This study explored the relationship between co-occurring diagnoses and risk factors of delinquency in an ethnically diverse sample of male and female adolescents who were court referred for an interdisciplinary assessment to determine treatment needs prior to out of home placement. Examining co-occurring diagnoses within diverse populations is important when considering the increasing rate of juvenile crime. An archival data set was utilized, which contained interdisciplinary team information regarding participant five axial diagnoses, risk assessment, using the WDRAS, and GAF score, and a family functioning score. Chi-square analyses were conducted to determine significant associations between demographic variables and diagnosis, risk factors, GAF score, and Family Functioning Score. Significant preliminary results were found for: gender and assaultive behavior, runaways, abuse, serious emotional disturbance, behavioral disorders, primary diagnosis, and substance use history; age, age at first referral, number of referrals, runaways, alcohol and substance use history, behavioral disorders, substance use disorders, and family functioning score; ethnicity and serious emotional disturbance, substance use disorders, and primary diagnosis. Hypothesis testing revealed that age of first referral, abuse history, and substance use history made significant contributions to the logistic regression model for co-occurring disorders. A small, positive correlation was found for risk factors and co-occurring disorders. Mood and co-occurring disorders were found to have a significant relationship. An additional logistic regression found that serious emotional disturbance made a significant contribution to the model for mood disorders, out of home placements and runaways made significant contributions to the model for anxiety disorders, school behavior problems made a significant contribution to the model for adjustment disorders, and serious emotional disturbance made a significant contribution to the model for V code disorders. No gender differences were found with regard to classification of diagnosis or severity of pathology. Findings for the study are discussed within the context of previous research, implications, limitations, and future research.

AB  - This dissertation analyzes nonprofit organizations that assist the homeless in twenty-six U.S. metropolitan areas from 1989 to 2002. The primary objective of this project is to explore how social and political context affect the interorganizational dynamics and distribution of homeless services. To achieve this end, I utilize a multi-method approach consisting of sixty interviews with executive directors, observations of city-wide task forces, and multiple sources of original time-series data on financial, operational, spatial, and network aspects of 4,765 organizations. These data provide analytical leverage to examine previously overlooked processes and the multilevel context of the sample offers methodological improvements over previous studies. In chapter 2, I use time-series analysis to demonstrate the unintended consequences of the 'charitable choice' policy on the mortality of organizations. As intended, charitable choice increased the survival odds of faith-based organizations relative to their secular rivals. However, this has led to the unintended consequence of relatively fewer rehabilitative social services via the 'hitchhiking' mechanism. In chapter 3, I compare the prevalence of services for homeless youth in twenty-six metropolitan areas. I find that politics and supply measures have a much greater effect on the prevalence of programs than the need for services (as measured by at-risk populations). The fourth chapter analyzes the spatial distribution of organizations within metropolitan areas. At both the micro and macro levels, I find evidence of 'not in my backyard' or NIMBYism, whereby powerful neighborhoods mobilize to keep homeless services out. Chapter 5 examines three interfaith networks providing homeless services in the Detroit metropolitan area. Although churches show a tendency to collaborate with peers from the same tradition, the most salient aspect of this distinction appears to be not theology, but race, a finding that can not be attributed to segregation since the model controls for spatial proximity. As a whole, the dissertation employs an open systems approach to the study of nonprofits, which are often the subjects of case studies.

AB  - This text deals with the history of the care & education for poor children & adolescents in Londrina & throughout Brazil. It describes the social context of the city & analyzes the performance of the municipal public authority related to the street children during the administration periods of 1993-1996 & 1997-2000, indicating similarities & differences in terms of realizing & conducting this task. It prioritizes the children's evaluation of the programs & projects especially designed for them. It is concluded that these programs do not fulfill the needs of this population. The article also considers whether the libertarian methods proposed by educators such as Paulo Freire, Cesare La Rocca, Antonio Carlos Gomes da Costa, & others come more closely to reality & might offer effective solutions for the social problem in question. 8 References.

AB  - Government agencies use varying criteria in defining homelessness. While scholars debate over and use different definitions of homelessness, little research has explored the impacts the definition has on perceived problem severity and the types of communities receiving aid. I first explore four definitions of child and youth homelessness used by United States’ federal agencies. I then use panel data for school districts, which report homelessness by subgroup, to analyze how the definition of homelessness changes its prevalence and leads to disparate impacts. I find the definition of homelessness including students living doubled-up leads to a higher growth rate. Definitions also change which districts have high rates of homelessness and characteristics of these districts, suggesting resources following students experiencing homelessness go to different types of communities. Scholars should consider how a problem is defined, differences in the measurement used between studies, and how the definition affects where resources go.

AB  - Despite the multiple and diverse types of school reform to influence instruction, curriculum and fiscal policies, many urban students have low educational success and attainment. A fundamental problem of school reform is that it fails to address the economic, social, physical and cultural challenges that plague urban communities, families and children. Many urban neighborhoods are plagued by violence, crime, homelessness, property damage, poverty and other ruinous and dire circumstances. The empirical literature on neighborhood effects has described a positive relationship between neighborhood conditions and youth developmental and behavioral outcomes. However, the results vary, and there is little consensus on which neighborhood characteristics is most important. The present study examines this issue by identifying several neighborhood characteristics that influence students' college-going behaviors and beliefs, specifically their college preparation, aspirations and enrollment. This study is difference from previous research in that it incorporates ideas from place-identity theory to conceptualize the individual experiences students face in have in their neighborhoods. To conceptualize or measure concepts related to place-identity theory, I use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to create student-level measures of neighborhood characteristics. The main data source for this study is the Philadelphia Educational Longitudinal Study (PELS), a seven-wave, longitudinal investigation of high school students and their parents. For this study, PELS is utilized to describe students' background characteristics, educational aspirations, and academic engagement and to link students to school data. In addition, census and geographic data are used to measure neighborhood disadvantage and students' spatial relationship to neighborhood liquor and beer stores and drug crimes. Consistent with findings from other neighborhood effects studies, the results from this study are mixed. Specifically, the findings reveal that the presence of some types of liquor stores and indicators of neighborhood disadvantage predict students' college-related indicators. The finding also indicate the individual-level neighborhood characteristics, that is the neighborhood features encountered the events experienced and those things seen by students, are important. Overall, I conclude from this study that student' experiences outside of school matter. Furthermore, this research suggests that future neighborhood research should utilize theories that directly hone in on individual perspectives and development, rather than focus on macro theories that solely focus on neighborhood processes, relationship and aggregate characteristics. Furthermore, future studies should incorporate GIS technologies and spatial analyses. Finally, I recommend that school reform measures to alleviate educational gaps and shortfalls should not only focus on the schooling environment, but also should incorporate broader policies to directly confront urban neighborhood disadvantage and family challenges.

AB  - School dropouts are considered an important target group for AIDS prevention. They are expected to be less knowledgeable about AIDS and to show a higher degree of risky behavior as compared with their school-attending peers. Several small-scale studies among specific groups of dropouts seem to confirm such expectations. However, due to differences in methodology, it is often difficult to compare the results of such studies with findings for youths who have not dropped out of school. The present study sought to remedy this by examining AIDS-related knowledge, attitudes, and behavior among comparable samples of Dutch secondary school students and dropouts (excluding homeless and drug-addicted adolescents). The two groups were compared with regard to knowledge about AIDS prevention, attitude toward condom use, intention to use condoms, sexual history, and condom use. Contrary to expectations, few differences were found. It was concluded that, in most respects, dropouts are similar to those who have remained in school.

AB  - It is held that the use of social capitalization theory in sociological criminology can reveal much if focus is placed on the failure to accummulate capital & its consequences. Analysis of Canadian youth crime & homelessness from a social capitalization perspective demonstrates that an anomie-inspired idea of social capital supplies researchers with a flexible theoretical framework for examining environmental differences between & within societies. It is argued that sociological criminology's limited store of data & the prevalence of street crime throughout the world make necessary additional research using this framework. 60 References.

AB  - The impacts of their immediate reality on the choices & behaviors of street children in Campinas, Brazil, were explored with ethnographic data on their lived experiences. These urban street children face struggles at every turn. They are exposed to hazardous cultural practices like drug use, sexual exploitation, & crime. This environment negatively affects the development of propositional logic & identity. These youth rarely have the chance to experiment with more positive identities or envision a future as full human beings. Intervention programs need to address these realities & provide alternatives.

AB  - Objective:  This study examined factors that influenced caregiver status for African-American mothers who use crack cocaine but are not receiving drug treatment and participated in an HIV prevention study in North Carolina. Method:  Caregiver mothers who were living with at least one of their children at intake (n = 257) were compared with non-Caregivers who were separated from all of their children (n = 378). Bivariate analyses and logistic regression were used to compare these mothers at intake on current drug use, risky sex practices, psychological symptoms, victimization, and aggression. Results:  Compared with Caregiver mothers, non-Caregivers reported higher frequencies of drug use, risky sex practices, psychological distress, and victimization experiences. Caregiver mothers were more likely than non-Caregiver mothers to have health insurance, but were less likely to have received drug treatment. Logistic regression found that non-Caregiver mothers were significantly more likely than Caregiver mothers to be older, to have been physically abused as children, to trade sex more frequently, to be homeless, and to have no health insurance. Recent crack use, psychological symptoms, and victimization were not significantly related to caregiver status. Conclusions:  Findings that socio-environmental factors were more strongly associated with caregiver status than crack use underscore the importance of contextual issues such as housing, victimization history, and resources in serving maternal crack users. Community outreach and interventions that engage mothers who use drugs and live with their children may be more effective strategies than formal office-based services to link mothers who use crack and their children to needed drug treatment and family and child services.

AB  - Despite implications for both humans and the environment, a scant body of research examines fertility in forest frontiers. This study examines the fertility-environment association using empirical data from Ecuadorian Amazon between 1980 and 1999. Fertility dramatically declined during this period, and our empirical models suggest that households' relationship to land partially explains this decline. Controlling for known fertility determinants such as age and education, women in households lacking land titles experienced a 27 % higher birth rate than did women in households with land titles. This suggests insecure land tenure was associated with higher fertility. Furthermore, each additional hectare of new pasture was associated with a 16 % higher birth rate, suggesting the potential role of a more stable and lucrative income source in supporting additional births. Findings from this research can help inform strategic policies to address sustainable development in frontier environments.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to consolidate and review current literature that relates children's health to their housing and living environments. The paper also reviews literature around municipal tower block estates and the unique health/architecture relationship before turning to children living in temporary bed and breakfast accommodation. An overview of current public health policy that seeks to reintegrate housing and well-being is undertaken. Decent housing lies at the heart of health for all. Generally, the picture is more positive, but action remains slow. Children's needs must be given a higher priority in housing in future to promote physical and emotional well-being. It is not an exhaustive list and the sources are mainly UK publications. The UK approach to children, housing and health may be of interest to a number of overseas countries in Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia. This paper fulfils an identified information/resources need and offers readers such as students, academics and practitioners an overview of the UK approach.
