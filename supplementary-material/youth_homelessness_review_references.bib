Lessons learned from business and medical settings are being applied but it is unclear how well they translate to settings with different historical origins and customs (e.g., public mental health, social service, alcohol/drug sectors). The purpose of this paper is to propose a multi-level, four phase model of the implementation process (i.e., Exploration, Adoption/Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment), derived from extant literature, and apply it to public sector services. We highlight features of the model likely to be particularly important in each phase, while considering the outer and inner contexts (i.e., levels) of public sector service systems.},

Wahine Talk includes provision of and connection to basic needs resources, peer mentoring, group based sexual health education, and linkage to and provision of sexual health care. Process and outcome data were collected throughout and for six months after Wahine Talk from a diverse group of 14--22-year-old female youth (N = 51) experiencing homelessness. In-depth individual and focus group interview data were collected from providers and youth after Wahine Talk, and analyzed using Template Analysis. Over half (62.7\%) of participants were linked to sexual health care during Wahine Talk and birth control usage tripled following the program. Depo-Provera and long acting reversible contraception (LARC) usage, in particular, increased during Wahine Talk (1--19\% and 0--25.5\%, respectively). Within six months, 31.4\% of youth had adopted LARC and 3.9\% were using Depo-Provera. Individual and focus group interviews with providers and youth affirm program acceptability and appropriateness.},

  abstract = {Background: The paper presents two-year findings from a study investigating the effectiveness of Housing First (HF) with assertive community treatment (ACT) in helping individuals with serious mental illness, who are homeless or precariously housed and living in a small city, to become stably housed. Methods: The research design was a parallel group non-blinded RCT with participants randomly assigned after the baseline interview to receive HF with ACT (N = 100) or treatment as usual (TAU; N = 101). Participants were interviewed every 3 months over 21/24 months to investigate changes on a range of housing and psychosocial outcomes. The primary outcomes were housing stability (as defined by a joint function of number of days housed and number of moves) and improvement in community functioning. Secondary predicted outcomes were improvements in self-rated physical and mental health status, substance use problems, quality of life, community integration, and recovery. Results: An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted. Compared to TAU participants, HF participants who entered housing did so more quickly (23.30 versus 88.25 days, d = 1.02, 95\% CI [0.50--1.53], p {$<$} 0.001), spent a greater proportion of time stably housed (Z = 5.30, p {$<$} 0.001, OR = 3.12, 95\% CI [1.96--4.27]), and rated the quality of their housing more positively (Z = 4.59, p {$<$} 0.001, d = 0.43, 95\% CI [0.25--0.62]). HF participants were also more likely to be housed continually in the final 6 months (i.e., 79.57\% vs. 55.47\%), {$\chi$}2 (2, n = 170) = 11.46, p = .003, Cramer's V = 0.26, 95\% CI [0.14--0.42]). HF participants showed greater gains in quality of life, (Z = 3.83, p {$<$} 0.001, ASMD = 0.50, 95\% CI [0.24--0.75]), psychological integration (Z = 12.89, p {$<$} 0.001, pooled ASMD = 0.91, 95\% CI [0.77--1.05]), and perceived recovery (Z = 2.26, p = 0.03, ASMD = 0.39, 95\% CI [0.05--0.74]) than TAU participants. Conclusions: The study indicates that HF ends homelessness significantly more rapidly than TAU for a majority of individuals with serious mental illness who have a history of homelessness and live in a small city. In addition, compared to TAU, HF produces psychosocial benefits for its recipients that include an enhanced quality of life, a greater sense of belonging in the community, and greater improvements in perceived recovery from mental illness.

The study was designed to strengthen initial promising results of an earlier study (P. L. Peterson, J. S. Baer, E. A. Wells, J. A. Ginzler, \& S. B. Garrett, 2006). Several modifications in the clinical protocol were included to enhance engagement with the intervention. Analyses revealed no significant benefits for intervention participants when homeless youths' substance use rates were compared with those of control participants. Service utilization during the intervention period increased for those receiving the intervention but returned to baseline levels at follow-up. Participants reported overall reductions in substance use over time. Differences between sampling methods for the current and previous study are discussed, as are the limitations of brief interventions with this population. Future research needs to elucidate mechanisms of change and service engagement for highly vulnerable youth.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Three-quarters of homeless people smoke cigarettes. Financial incentives for smoking abstinence have appeared promising in nonexperimental studies of homeless smokers, but randomized controlled trial (RCT) data are lacking. Methods: We conducted a pilot RCT of financial incentives for homeless smokers. Incentive arm participants (N = 25) could earn escalating \$15--\$35 rewards for brief smoking abstinence (exhaled carbon monoxide {$<$}8 parts per million) assessed 14 times over 8 weeks. Control arm participants (N = 25) were given \$10 at each assessment regardless of abstinence. All participants were offered nicotine patches and counseling. The primary outcome was a repeated measure of brief smoking abstinence across 14 assessments. The secondary outcome was brief abstinence at 8 weeks. Exploratory outcomes were self-reported 1-day and 7-day abstinence from (1) any cigarette and (2) any puff of a cigarette. Other outcomes included 24-hour quit attempts, nicotine patch use, counseling attendance, and changes in alcohol and drug use. Results: Compared to control, incentive arm participants were more likely to achieve brief abstinence overall (odds ratio 7.28, 95\% confidence interval 2.89 to 18.3) and at 8 weeks (48\% vs. 8\%, p = .004). Similar effects were seen for 1-day abstinence, but 7-day puff abstinence was negligible in both arms. Incentive arm participants made more quit attempts (p = .03). Nicotine patch use and counseling attendance were not significantly different between the groups. Alcohol and drug use did not change significantly in either group. Conclusions: Among homeless smokers, financial incentives increased brief smoking abstinence and quit attempts without worsening substance use. This approach merits further development focused on promoting sustained abstinence.},

  abstract = {Background Homelessness is associated with poor health. A policy approach aiming to end homelessness across Europe and North America, the `Housing First' (HF) model, provides rapid housing, not conditional on abstinence from substance use. We aimed to systematically review the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the effects of HF on health and well-being. Methods We searched seven databases for randomised controlled trials of interventions providing rapid access to non-abstinence-contingent, permanent housing. We extracted data on the following outcomes: mental health; self-reported health and quality of life; substance use; non-routine use of healthcare services; housing stability. We assessed risk of bias and calculated standardised effect sizes. Results We included four studies, all with `high' risk of bias. The impact of HF on most short-term health outcomes was imprecisely estimated, with varying effect directions. No clear difference in substance use was seen. Intervention groups experienced fewer emergency department visits (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=0.63; 95\% CI 0.48 to 0.82), fewer hospitalisations (IRR=0.76; 95\% CI 0.70 to 0.83) and less time spent hospitalised (standardised mean difference (SMD)=-0.14; 95\% CI -0.41 to 0.14) than control groups. In all studies intervention participants spent more days housed (SMD=1.24; 95\% CI 0.86 to 1.62) and were more likely to be housed at 18--24 months (risk ratio=2.46; 95\% CI 1.58 to 3.84). Conclusion HF approaches successfully improve housing stability and may improve some aspects of health. Implementation of HF would likely reduce homelessness and non-routine health service use without an increase in problematic substance use. Impacts on long-term health outcomes require further investigation. Trial registration number CRD42017064457},

  abstract = {Objective: To review epidemiologic studies of the health of street youth in industrialized countries, with a special focus on Canadian youth., Methods: We identified 52 peer-reviewed studies from searches of the MEDLINE database and bibliographies of published papers, for data on blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections, mental health problems, pregnancy, violence and mortality., Results: Rates of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV infection are much higher among street youth than among their non-street peers. Likewise, the prevalence of all mental health problems assessed in street youth is greater than that in non-street youth. Pregnancy is more frequent among street than household youth. Street youth also experience high levels of violence: a large proportion report physical abuse or assault. Finally, mortality is about 11 times the expected rate based on age and sex and is mainly caused by suicide and drug overdose., Conclusion: Current research results are useful to orient public health interventions for street youth, but further epidemiologic research is needed. The need for Canadian data is particularly acute in specific areas including mental health, violence, pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections such as, for example, herpes infection and syphilis., MeSH terms: Homeless youth; communicable diseases; sexually transmitted diseases; mental disorders; violence; mortality.},

The complex nature of homelessness is revealed across a variety of academic fields including planning, pharmacology, urban affairs, housing policy, nutrition, psychiatry, sociology, public health, urban health, and criminology. We undertook a scoping review according to PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) that mapped the breadth and scale of the evidence-base and identified themes and gaps. We identified 476 reports and after excluding duplicates and ones that did not relate to our criteria, were left with 100 studies from eight countries. Each of them identified benefits and/or changes that occurred when people experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity transitioned into a secure, stable home. Outcomes measured were distributed across a range of domains including physical and mental health, well-being, mortality rates, criminal justice interaction, service use, and cost-effectiveness. Findings varied by degree but overwhelmingly found improvements in all domains once people were permanently housed. Housing provided a foundation for people to envisage a better life and make plans for the future. As one woman who had fled a violent home was quoted as saying: ``housing made everything else possible.'' The research identified savings for taxpayers and the wider community once people left homelessness for the stability of a permanent home, even after factoring in the cost of housing and rental help. We found numerous gaps. For example, there was a prevalence of studies that focused on those who are visibly homeless, in particular chronically homeless men with mental illness and/or substance use issues. Much less research looked at women whose patterns of homelessness are more varied and even less at homelessness involving children and families. Women who had left domestic and family violence were investigated in a very small number of studies and sample sizes were small. Few reports undertook the complex task of quantifying and comparing cost savings. Other notable gaps were older women, older people more generally, refugees, recent migrants, veterans, Indigenous people and those with a disability.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality among people experiencing homelessness. This study investigated whether housing intervention affects cardiovascular disease risk factors among homeless adults with mental illnesses over a 24-month period. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of a Housing First intervention that provided communitybased scattered-site housing and support services. Five hundred seventy-five participants were randomized to the intervention (n=301) or treatment as usual (TAU) (n=274). Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle using generalized estimating equations. There were no differences in change over 24 months between the 2 groups for blood pressure, tobacco, and cocaine/crack use. However, the intervention had an impact on reducing the number of days of alcohol intoxication by 1.58 days compared with TAU (95\% CI, -2.88 to -0.27, P=0.0018). Over the 24-month period, both the intervention and TAU groups had significant reductions in tobacco and cocaine use. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention, compared with TAU, did not result in greater improvements in many of the selected cardiovascular risk factors. Since the study took place in a service-rich city with a range of pre-existing supportive services and universal health insurance, the high level of usual services available to the TAU group may have contributed to reductions in their cardiovascular disease risk factors. Further research is needed to develop interventions to reduce risk factors of cardiovascular disease among people experiencing homelessness and mental illness beyond existing treatments.},

Although emerging research shows that youth with cognitive disabilities are more likely to become homeless and that rates of cognitive disabilities are higher among the homeless population than the population in general, exploring the intersection of disability and homelessness for youth has not been a priority. In this study, a critical disability and systems failure lens is brought to bear on the vulnerability of youth who experience this intersection. Based on interviews with key informants in the disability, homelessness, education, employment and child welfare sectors in three sites in Ontario, Canada, the invisibility of disability among homeless youth is brought to light. We explore the ways youth with a disability in the homelessness sector are made vulnerable, the insurmountable barriers to getting access to the requisite assessment for disability services and the siloed nature of the homelessness and disability service sectors. An argument is made that ``working outside the box'' to assist youth to navigate significant system disjunctures is insufficient.},

Eight projects in a national, cooperative study collected new data at baseline, 6, and 12 months using a set of common measures as well as site-specific instruments. The pooled sample consisted of 1,381 persons in treatment for mental illness or substance abuse (or both), of which 84\% had a history of homelessness. The analyses employed classical and Rasch methods to examine the MCSI's content validity, internal consistency and item quality, test/retest reliability, dimensionality, appropriateness for the sample, construct validity, and responsiveness to change. This 14-item scale was found to be a reliable and valid measure of psychological symptoms in this sample. Its content was consistent with other symptom measures, its high internal consistency and test-retest coefficients supported its reliability, its relationships to other measures indicated that it had good construct validity, and it was responsive to change. We conclude that the MCSI performed similarly to longer, more widely used measures of psychological symptomatology and could be useful in other studies targeting homeless adults with severe mental illness, substance use disorders, or both.},

  abstract = {Background: Evidence on the effectiveness of programs serving unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness remains limited and mixed, and we know little about the factors that contribute to participant engagement and program implementation across contexts. Objective: In this meta-synthesis of current findings on youth interventions, we explore the following research questions: (1) What are common programmatic or contextual factors that researchers and/or practitioners identify as contributing to the successful implementation of an intervention for homeless and unstably housed youth? and (2) What programmatic or contextual factors do youth and practitioners identify as hindering suc\- cessful implementation of an intervention for these youth? Methods: Through systematic searches of academic databases for articles and reports published between 2008 and 2018---as well as identifying unpublished concurrent studies through professional outreach, hand-searching reference lists, and searches of websites---we screened 1602 studies through two levels of blind review. We then inductively coded the resulting 47 studies that met our inclusion criteria to identify patterns and gaps in the existing literature about implementation and engagement in these programs. Results: Most of the studies analyzed took place in urban settings, were based on programs located in the United States, and included a variety of interventions from behavioral health treatment to street outreach and case management. The 47 eligible studies included 3112 youth and 495 staff participants. Only 3 out of the 47 studies explicitly focused on racial or LGBTQ equity. Two primary themes regarding factors that support successful implementation and engagement were identified: (1) Organizational and system-wide policies can shape the quality and duration of interventions, and (2) Staff behaviors and training are paramount to the success of many interventions. With respect to organizational and system-wide policies, many studies highlighted the importance of fostering a developmentally appropriate balance between structure and flexibility; considerations to access including low-barrier options when appropriate; concerns regarding the physical space of the program; and coordination with other agencies, particularly for effective referrals. With respect to staffing behaviors and training, studies highlighted that engagement with youth experiencing homelessness requires strong commu\- nication, a youth-centered approach, and a ``flexible, non-judgmental orientation,'' that allows youth a sub\- stantial level of self-determination. Conclusions: Given these findings, this review supports services that emphasize empowerment and antipaternalism, and increased attention to racial and LGBTQ equity in future exploration of implementation and engagement within programs designed for youth experiencing homelessness.},

This study is a secondary analysis of data collected in a randomized clinical trial of AWARE, a new 4 session group motivational interviewing intervention. AWARE mainly focused on alcohol use and sexual risk behavior given focus group feedback. We used sequential coding to analyze how the group process affected both AOD use and sexual risk behavior at 3-month follow up among homeless young adults by examining facilitator behavior and participant change talk (CT) and sustain talk (ST). We analyzed 57 group session digital recordings of 100 youth (69\% male, 74\% heterosexual, 28\% non-Hispanic white, 23\% African American, 26\% Hispanic, 23\% multiracial/ other; mean age 21.75). Outcomes included importance and readiness to change AOD use and risky sexual behavior, AOD use and consequences, number of partners and unprotected sex, and condom self-efficacy. Sequential analysis indicated that facilitator open-ended questions and reflections of CT increased Group CT. Group CT was associated with a lower likelihood of being a heavy drinker 3 months later; Group ST was associated with decreased readiness and confidence to change alcohol use. There were no associations with CT or ST for drug use or risky sexual behavior. Facilitator speech and peer responses were related to CT and ST during the group sessions with this high risk population, which were then associated with individual changes for alcohol use. Further research is needed to explore associations with drug use and sexual risk behavior.},

RHY have multiple, overlapping problems often including poor physical and mental health, frequent street victimization, and histories of physical and sexual abuse. Further, current street victimization interacts with childhood abuse to produce complex, unique presentations of traumatic symptoms and related disorders in runaway and homeless youth. This review paper explores (1) the role of childhood trauma in the genesis of runaway and homeless behavior, and (2) how childhood trauma interacts with street victimization to create vulnerability to psychopathology. In response to the trauma needs of RHY, we conducted a systematic review of the state of the current literature on trauma-informed interventions for RHY. We conclude that the field currently lacks empirically validated trauma interventions in RHY. However, theoretically plausible frameworks do exist and could be the basis for future research and intervention development.},

Self-reported data were obtained from sexual minority (n = 28\,405) and heterosexual (n = 136\,232) youth through a survey administered in high schools. We assessed the prevalence of homelessness and the types of homelessness. Sexual minority-stratified bivariate and multivariable analyses assessed associations between homelessness, state-level policy and cultural environments, and health-risk behaviors.Sexual minority youth were significantly more likely (12\%) to be homeless compared with heterosexual youth (4.1\%). Greater acceptance of sexual diversity at the state-level was associated with reduced homelessness among both sexual minority and heterosexual youth. Finally, homeless sexual minority youth experienced a broad array of health risk behaviors in excess of both nonhomeless sexual minority youth and homeless heterosexual youth.Sexual minority high school students were more likely to experience homelessness than their heterosexual peers.

  abstract = {The Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN)1 is a 1--2 hour standardized biopsychosocial that integrates clinical and research assessment for people presenting to substance abuse treatment. The GAIN -- Short Screener (GSS) is 3--5 minute screener to quickly identify those who would have a disorder based on the full 60--120 minute GAIN and triage the problem and kind of intervention they are likely to need along four dimensions (internalizing disorders, externalizing disorders, substance disorders, and crime/violence). Data were collected from 6,177 adolescents and 1,805 adults as part of 77 studies in three dozen locations around the United States that used the GAIN. For both adolescents and adults the 20-item total disorder screener (TDScr) and its four 5-item sub-screeners (internalizing disorders, externalizing disorders, substance disorders, and crime/violence) has good internal consistency (alpha of .96 on total screener), is highly correlated (r = .84 to .94) with the 123-item longer scales in the full GAIN. The GSS also does well in terms of its receiver operator characteristics (90\% or more under the curve in all analyses) and has clinical decision-making cut points with excellent sensitivity (90\% or more) for identifying people with a disorder and excellent specificity (92\% or more) for correctly ruling out people who did not have a disorder. The GSS has good potential as an efficient screener for identifying people with co-occurring disorders across multiple systems and routing them to the right services and more detailed assessments.},

It is unknown whether specific treatment approaches are more or less effective for youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) compared to stably housed youth. The present study compared the effectiveness of the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach, Motivational Enhancement Therapy combined with Cognitive--Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT), and Treatment as Usual (TAU) for these two groups. Further subgroup differences were investigated by age, sex, and sexual and gender minority status. Method: YEH (n = 855) and a matched sample of stably housed youth (n = 855) were drawn from the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs, a nationwide substance use treatment data set. Multiple-group latent change score modeling was used to examine change in substance use frequency and related problems at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Results: Results indicated significant declines in substance use frequency and problems during treatment for all intervention groups. The TAU group showed the greatest declines in substance use problems during treatment and the greatest declines in frequency post-treatment. Compared to stably housed youth, YEH entered treatment with greater substance use and problems, and had greater declines in substance use in the MET/CBT group only. Other differences were found by age and sex. Conclusions: Overall, all three substance use interventions appear to be effective in reducing substance use and related problems. TAU and MET/CBT may be particularly effective for YEH in treatment settings. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.},

This paper examines the effects of a homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing program---which combines temporary rental subsidies with light-touch case management---on homeless and highly mobile students in a large urban school district. By linking detailed district administrative data with programmatic data, I create a novel dataset that allows me to estimate impacts to students in the immediate weeks and months following exposure to the rehousing intervention. Specifically, I use generalized and event study difference-in-differences models to estimate within-student differences in district and school mobility, attendance, and behavioral outcomes before and after beginning participation in the program. I find that the treatment improves student behavior, significantly reducing the likelihood of students having multiple behavioral incidents in a month, but increases students' absence rates and chronic absenteeism, particularly for students who are rehoused outside the city proper but remain enrolled in the central district. These results highlight both the positive impacts of this type of intervention, as well as unintended consequences, raising questions around the priorities and inherent tradeoffs of rehousing programs.},

Secure housing status, health service usage and quality of life (HoNOS) data were extracted from participants' electronic hospital and Doorway records in deidentified, non-reidentifiable form. Analysis for continuous outcome variables was based on multivariate GLM modelling. Results: Doorway housed 89 (57\%) of 157 accepted participants. The 157 Doorway participants overall were also housed for significantly more days (119.4 extra days per participant) than control participants, albeit after some delay in locating and moving into housing (mean 14 weeks). There was a significant, positive Doorway effect on health outcomes (all and one dimension of the HoNOS). Doorway participants had significantly reduced length of stay during acute and community hospital admissions (7.4 fewer days per participant) compared with the control group. Conclusion: The Doorway model represents a new and substantial opportunity to house, enhance health outcomes and reduce mental health service use for people with SPMIs from the public mental health sector and at-risk of homelessness.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To systematically analyze the self-reported reasons why children and youth around the world become street-involved and to analyze the available data by level of human development, geographic region, and sex. DATA SOURCES Electronic searches of Scopus, PsychINFO, EMBASE, POPLINE, PubMed, ERIC, and the Social Sciences Citation Index were conducted from January 1, 1990, to the third week of July 2013. We searched the peer-reviewed literature for studies that reported quantitative reasons for street involvement. The following broad search strategy was used to search the databases: ``street children'' OR ``street youth'' OR ``homeless youth'' OR ``homeless children'' OR ``runaway children'' OR ``runaway youth'' or ``homeless persons.'' STUDY SELECTION Studies were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) participants were 24 years of age or younger, (2) participants met our definition of street-connected children and youth, and (3) the quantitative reasons for street involvement were reported. We reviewed 318 full texts and identified 49 eligible studies. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers. We fit logistic mixed-effects models to estimate the pooled prevalence of each reason and to estimate subgroup pooled prevalence by development level or geographic region. The meta-analysis was conducted from February to August 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We created the following categories based on the reported reasons in the literature: poverty, abuse, family conflict, delinquency, psychosocial health, and other. RESULTS In total, there were 13 559 participants from 24 countries, of which 21 represented developing countries. The most commonly reported reason for street involvement was poverty, with a pooled-prevalence estimate of 39\% (95\% CI, 29\%-51\%). Forty-seven studies included in this review reported family conflict as the reason for street involvement, with a pooled prevalence of 32\% (95\% CI, 26\%-39\%). Abuse was equally reported in developing and developed countries as the reason for street involvement, with a pooled prevalence of 26\% (95\% CI, 18\%-35\%). Delinquency was the least frequently cited reason overall, with a pooled prevalence of 10\% (95\% CI, 5\%-20\%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The street-connected children and youth who provided reasons for their street involvement infrequently identified delinquent behaviors for their circumstances and highlighted the role of poverty as a driving factor. They require support and protection, and governments globally are called on to reduce the socioeconomic inequities that cause children and youth to turn to the streets in the first place, in all regions of the world.},

The literature offers many examples of using evidence-based supported employment models with vulnerable populations to assist them in obtaining and maintaining competitive employment; yet few examples exist to date with homeless young adults with mental illness. Objective The purpose of this study was thus to adapt an evidence-based intervention for adults with psychiatric illnesses [i.e., the Individual Placement and Support (IPS)] with homeless young adults with mental illness. Methods Convenience sampling was used to recruit 20 homeless young adults (ages 18--24) with mental illness from the host agency. Participants received the IPS intervention over 10 months. A comparison sample was used at a separate agency of 16 homeless young adults with mental illness, who received standard agency services. Using a pre-post, self-comparison quasi-experimental design, the impact of the IPS was assessed on five employment outcomes: (1) ever-worked rate, (2) working-at-follow-up rate, (3) monthly work rate, (4) weekly work hours and (5) weekly income. Results The IPS group was significantly more likely to have worked at some point over the 10-month study as well as to have worked a greater number of months overall. Conclusions Findings provide greater insight into adapting, implementing and evaluating the IPS model with homeless young adults with mental illness. The study},

Data were collected on mental health, housing, and social support outcomes at baseline and one follow-up period. Results: Findings from mixed analysis of variance indicate that both SEI and IPS participants displayed statistically significant changes in their self-esteem, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) problems, inattention problems, living in a shelter, and living in a private residence. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate the comparative efficacy and short-term nonvocational outcomes of SEI and IPS with homeless youth with mental illness.

Latent class analyses identified subtypes of housing problems, including literal homelessness, housing instability, and stable housing. Regressions predicted subgroup membership based on aging out experiences, receipt of foster care services, and youth and county characteristics. Youth who reunified after out-of-home placement in adolescence exhibited the lowest probability of literal homelessness, while youth who aged out experienced similar rates of literal homelessness as youth investigated by child welfare but never placed out of home. No differences existed between groups on prevalence of unstable housing. Exposure to independent living services and extended foster care did not relate with homelessness prevention. Findings emphasize the developmental importance of families in promoting housing stability in the transition to adulthood, while questioning child welfare current focus on preparing foster youth to live.},

We define housing security among 8 main dimensions: housing type, recent housing history, current housing tenure, financial status, standing in the legal system, education and employment status, harmful substance use, and subjective assessments of housing satisfaction and stability. Based on these dimensions, we suggest a brief 13-question scale that measures housing security.},

  abstract = {Background Emerging evidence at the international level suggests that the Housing First approach could improve the housing stability of young people experiencing homelessness. However, there is a dearth of literature in Canada on whether the Housing First intervention for young people experiencing homelessness can improve outcomes including housing stability, health and well-being, and access to complementary supports. Adapted from the original Housing First model, Housing First for Youth (HF4Y) was developed in Canada as a rights-based approach tailored specifically for young people aged 16 to 24 years who are experiencing or are at risk of homelessness. Objective The Making the Shift Youth Homelessness Social Innovation Lab is testing the effectiveness of the HF4Y intervention in Canada. The objective of this study is to determine whether the HF4Y model results in better participant-level outcomes than treatment-as-usual services for young people experiencing homelessness in 2 urban settings: Ottawa and Toronto, Ontario. Primary outcomes include housing stability, health and well-being, and complementary supports, and secondary outcomes include employment and educational attainment and social inclusion. Methods The HF4Y study used a multisite, mixed methods, randomized controlled trial research approach for data collection and analysis. Eligible participants included young people aged 16 to 24 years who were experiencing homelessness or housing precarity. The participants were randomly assigned to either the treatment-as-usual group or the housing first intervention group. Survey and interview data in Ottawa and Toronto, Ontario are being collected at multiple time points (3-6 months) over 4 years to capture a range of outcomes. Analytic strategies for quantitative data will include mixed-effects modeling for repeated measures and logistic models. A thematic analysis will be used to analyze qualitative data based on participants' narratives and life journeys through homelessness. Furthermore, program fidelity evaluations are conducted within each HF4Y program. These evaluations assess how well the intervention aligns with the HF4Y model and identify any areas that may require adjustments or additional support. Results The HF4Y study has received human participant research ethics approval from the Office of Research Ethics at York University. Recruitment was conducted between February 2018 and March 2020. Data collection is expected to be completed at both sites by March 2024. A preliminary analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data collected between baseline and 24 months is underway. Conclusions This pilot randomized controlled trial is the first to test the effectiveness of the HF4Y intervention in Canada. The findings of this study will enhance our understanding of how to effectively deliver and scale up the HF4Y intervention, with the aim of continually improving the HF4Y model to promote better outcomes for youth.

The survey was administered to staff and clients of 93 supported-housing programs in California. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to identify the items and model structure that best fit the data. Results Sixteen items were retained in a two-factor model, one related to approach to housing, separation of housing and services, and service philosophy and one related to service array and team structure.

This study examined the relationship between fidelity to the Housing First model and residential outcomes among clients of full service partnerships (FSPs) in California. Methods: This study had a mixed-methods design. Quantitative administrative and survey data were used to describe FSP practices and to examine the association between fidelity to Housing First and residential outcomes in the year before and after enrollment of 6,584 FSP clients in 86 programs. Focus groups at 20 FSPs provided qualitative data to enhance the understanding of these findings with actual accounts of housing-related experiences in high- and low-fidelity programs. Results: Prior to enrollment, the mean days of homelessness were greater at high- versus low-fidelity (101 versus 46 days) FSPs. After adjustment for individual characteristics, the analysis found that days spent homeless after enrollment declined by 87 at high-fidelity programs and by 34 at low-fidelity programs. After adjustment for days spent homeless before enrollment, days spent homeless after enrollment declined by 63 at high-fidelity programs and by 53 at low-fidelity programs. After enrollment, clients at high-fidelity programs spent more than 60 additional days in apartments than clients at low-facility programs. Differences were found between high- and low-fidelity FSPs in client choice in housing and how much clients' goals were considered in housing placement. Conclusions: Programs with greater fidelity to the Housing First model enrolled clients with longer histories of homelessness and placed most of them in apartments.},

Objectives: We examined factors associated with housing and child welfare outcomes to understand whom supportive housing benefits the most. Participants and setting: Analyses included 500 insecurely housed families involved in child protective services across five U.S. sites. Researchers randomized families to receive supportive housing or the usual services offered to families in local child welfare systems. Methods: We examined predictors of homelessness and child welfare outcomes with logistic regression, survival analysis, and receiver operating characteristic curves. We also examined supportive housing's effect across risk levels for each outcome and tested theoretical moderators of intervention effects. Results: Consistent with findings from the larger project of which this was a part, supportive housing improved housing outcomes for families, especially those most at risk form homelessness. Its effects on child welfare outcomes varied by study site more than by risk level. Family characteristics and experiences that predicted housing and child welfare outcomes also varied by site and added limited accuracy to predictive models. Theoretical moderators did not influence supportive housing's effects. Conclusions: Supportive housing increases housing security and may influence child welfare outcomes in some contexts. Family characteristics and experiences marginally improve targeting of supportive housing to insecurely housed families involved with CPS.},

To reduce rates of youth homelessness, a better understanding of both risk and resilience is needed to inform future intervention development. This article presents a systematic review of published research reporting risk or resilience factors related to homelessness among young people in Western countries. Methods: After thorough examination for inclusion criteria, 665 abstracts of peer-reviewed quantitative studies of risk or resilience factors for homelessness among young people (ages 0--25) that included an adequate comparison group (e.g., not homeless) were selected. After abstract and full-text screening, 16 articles were reviewed. A primary prevention framework was used to create an explanatory model for the onset of homelessness using risk and resilience factors. Results: Common risk factors for youth homelessness included difficulties with family, mental health or substance use problems, a history of problem behaviors, a history of foster care, homelessness as a child, and running away. Common protective factors included a supportive family, a college education, and high socioeconomic status. Findings were integrated into a provisional developmental model of youth homelessness risk. Clinical implications of the model for service development are discussed, and a model for monitoring homelessness risk and resilience factors is proposed. Conclusions: Factors affecting homelessness risk among youths and adults differ, with family, foster care, and schooling playing a much more important role among youths. Findings highlight opportunities for youth homelessness prevention strategies and monitoring.},

Methods: Homeless youth (14--24 years old) were engaged by research assistants (RAs) at soup kitchens, parks, libraries, and other locations that homeless youth were known to frequent. Youth were randomly assigned to receive six months of advocacy that focused on linking youth to a drop-in center (n = 40) or to a crisis shelter (n = 39). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Hard drug use over time was the main outcome. Intervention condition and service connection were used as predictors for the baseline level and the slope of change in hard drug use over time. Data analysis was conducted with Bernoulli Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling in HLM7. Results: The current study found that those who were in the drop-in linkage condition exhibited a greater reduction in their odds of using hard drugs during the follow-up points than their counterparts in the shelter linkage condition. And finally, those who utilized services more often during the follow-ups were those who exhibited less hard drug use at baseline and less reduction in their odds of using hard drugs. Conclusions: This study suggests that drop-in centers, which are often characterized by low-demand programming and few behavioral restrictions, are effective for addressing hard drug use among homeless youth.},

This systematic review collates, summarizes, and appraises published studies of youth investigating relationships between homelessness, perpetration of sexual offenses, experience of sexual victimization, and engagement in sexual risk behavior. A systematic search of seventeen psychology, health, and social science electronic databases was conducted. Search terms included``homeless*,'' ``youth,''``offend*,''``victimization,''``crime,''``rape,''``victim*,'' and``sex crimes.''Thirty-eight studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Findings showed homeless youth commonly report being raped and sexually assaulted, fear being sexually victimized, and engage in street prostitution and survival sex. Rates of victimization and sexual risk behavior were generally higher for females. Given the paucity of longitudinal studies and limitations of current studies, it is unclear whether homelessness is prospectively associated with sexual victimization or engagement in sexual risk behavior, and whether such associations vary cross nationally and as a function of time and place. Future prospective research examining the influence of the situational context of homelessness is necessary to develop a better understanding of how homelessness influences the perpetration of sexual offenses, experience of sexual victimization, and engagement in sexual risk behavior among homeless youth.},

Drawing on life history interviews conducted with 50 homeless youth in Los Angeles, explanations provided by participants for becoming homelessness and how they understand their experiences are presented. In professional discourses, homeless young people are often portrayed as victims of physical abuse and emotional neglect. Although participants' narratives reveal that abuse and neglect play a central role in their decisions to leave home, many maintain a sense of agency in the recounting of how they became homeless. The importance of service providers recognizing young people's agency is discussed.},

  abstract = {Introduction The annual economic burden of chronic homelessness in the U.S. is estimated to be as high as \$3.4 billion. The Permanent Supportive Housing with Housing First (Housing First) program, implemented to address the problem, has been shown to be effective. This paper examines the economic cost and benefit of Housing First Programs. Methods The search of peer-reviewed and gray literature from inception of databases through November 2019 yielded 20 evaluation studies of Housing First Programs, 17 from the U.S. and 3 from Canada. All analyses were conducted from March 2019 through July 2020. Monetary values are reported in 2019 U.S. dollars. Results Evidence from studies conducted in the U.S. was separated from those conducted in Canada. The median intervention cost per person per year for U.S. studies was \$16,479, and for all studies, including those from Canada, it was \$16,336. The median total benefit for the U.S. studies was \$18,247 per person per year, and it was \$17,751 for all studies, including those from Canada. The benefit-to-cost ratio for U.S. studies was 1.80:1, and for all studies, including those from Canada, it was 1.06:1. Discussion The evidence from this review shows that economic benefits exceed the cost of Housing First Programs in the U.S. There were too few studies to determine cost--benefit in the Canadian context.},

  abstract = {This article presents findings of a pilot test of a Motivational Interviewing social network intervention (MI-SNI) to enhance motivation to reduce high risk alcohol and other drug (AOD) use among formerly homeless individuals transitioning to housing. Delivered in-person by a facilitator trained in MI, this four-session computer-assisted intervention provides personalized social network visualization feedback to help participants understand the people in their network who trigger their alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and those who support abstinence. If ready, participants are encouraged to make changes to their social network to help reduce their own high-risk behavior. Participants were 41 individuals (33 male, 7 female, 1 other; 23 African-American, 5 non-Latino White, 6 Latino, 7 other, mean age 48) who were transitioning from homelessness to permanent supportive housing. They were randomly assigned to either the MI-SNI condition or usual care. Readiness to change AOD use, AOD abstinence self-efficacy, and AOD use were assessed at baseline and shortly after the final intervention session for the MI-SNI arm and around 3-months after baseline for the control arm. Acceptability of the intervention was also evaluated. MI-SNI participants reported increased readiness to change AOD use compared to control participants. We also conducted a subsample analysis for participants at one housing program and found a significant intervention effect on readiness to change AOD use, AOD abstinence self-efficacy, and alcohol use compared to control participants. Participants rated the intervention as highly acceptable. We conclude that a brief computer-assisted Motivational Interviewing social network intervention has potential to efficaciously impact readiness to change AOD use, AOD abstinence self-efficacy, and AOD use among formerly homeless individuals transitioning to permanent supportive housing, and warrants future study in larger clinical trials.},

It is intended to contribute to efforts to build out the youth homelessness intervention literature, which is underdeveloped relative to descriptive characterizations of risk. The 6-month intervention examined here, referred to as the Housing Outreach Program---Collaboration (HOP-C), is comprised of transitional outreach-based case management, individual and group mental health supports, and peer support. The intervention was delivered through a multiagency, interdisciplinary collaboration. Feasibility was assessed using a mixed methods design that included prepost intervention metrics and the study site was a large Canadian urban center. A total of 31 youth participated in the study with 28 completing the intervention. Overall, implementation and youth engagement was successful though patterns and intensity of engagement were quite variable. While prepost, self-report metrics improved modestly, substantial gains were observed in employment, education, and mental health service connectedness. Qualitative themes focused on the benefits of a flexible, multicomponent approach, close attention to seamless delivery and common factors, and supporting youth in the balance of isolation versus independence. These findings suggested that this tertiary prevention approach is feasible and warrants further investigation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Objectives: Given the lack of evidence for interventions targeting housing outcomes in transitional-age homeless youth (ages 18--24 years), we aimed to test the effect of Housing First on housing stability among a group of homeless youth with mental illness enrolled in At Home/Chez Soi, a \$110 million 24month randomized controlled trial of Housing First in five Canadian cities. Methods: Homeless individuals with mental illness were randomized to receive Housing First, a scattered-site choice-based housing intervention (without preconditions of sobriety or psychiatric treatment) and mental health services according to the level of need (assertive community treatment or intensive case management), or usual care. Participants completed interviews every 6 months and measures of housing status every 3 months to a total of 24 months. We assessed housing stability as percent days stably housed as a proportion of days for which residence data were available in youth aged 18--24 years, fit a model with a three-way interaction of treatment group (age 18--24 years vs. {$>$}24 years), and compared the effect on housing stability in youth versus adults. We used a repeated measures mixed-effects model to estimate differences/ratios from baseline over 24 months for secondary health and service use outcomes. Results: Of the 2,148 total participants who were randomized, 156 were youth aged 18--24 years: 87 received Housing First and 69 received usual care. In an adjusted analysis, youth in Housing First were stably housed a mean of 437/645 (65 percent) days for which data were available compared with youth in usual care, who were stably housed a mean of 189/582 (31 percent) days, resulting in an adjusted mean difference of 34 percent (95\% CI 24--45, P {$<$} 0.0001). The effect of the three-way interaction of treatment group, age, and time on housing stability was nonsignificant (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.5934). Youth who received Housing First were less likely to have a period of employment (adjusted OR {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.48, 95\% CI 0.24--0.99, P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.0456), but otherwise, their secondary outcomes were not significantly different from youth who received usual care. Conclusions: Housing First led to improved housing stability in homeless youth with mental illness and appears to be no less effective in youth than in older adults. More research is needed to guide adaptations of the model to further improve housing stability and other outcomes in youth.},

This presentation aims to describe examples of the generation, evaluation, and implementation of research on complex psychosocial interventions for children and youth at various levels. Methods: We will describe an example of generating evidence for children and youth from adult psychiatric research, programs that have improved outcomes for children with behavior disorders and adolescents with depression through integrated care, and regional transformation of services in four Canadian provinces and conclude with some key lessons from implementation science to guide future research in child and adolescent psychiatry. Results: There is emerging and well-established evidence of models to better serve children and youth with mental illness and addictions. Generating evidence from innovative models in adult psychiatry can be a first step in tailoring interventions to children and youth. Integrated care models are accumulating evidence for specific diagnoses at the program level, and implementation of these models across varied settings and diagnostic groups has the potential to transform systems in children's mental health. At each of these stages of research, implementation science can inform more rigorous evaluation and dissemination of these methods. Conclusions: Synthesizing and reflecting on these current examples of evidence generation, evaluation, and implementation at various levels may guide future interventions to better serve young people with mental illness and addictions.},

We aimed to evaluate the effect of "Housing First" on housing stability in homeless youth aged 18 to 24 years participating in At Home/Chez Soi, a 24-month randomized trial of "Housing First" in 5 Canadian cities. METHODS: Homeless individuals with mental illness were randomized to receive "Housing First" (combined with assertive community treatment or intensive case management depending on their level of need) or treatment as usual. We defined our primary outcome, housing stability, as the percent of days stably housed as a proportion of days for which residence data were available. RESULTS: Of 2148 participants who completed baseline interviews and were randomized, 7\% (n = 156) were youth aged 18 to 24 years; 87 received "Housing First" and 69 received treatment as usual. In an adjusted analysis, youth in "Housing First" were stably housed a mean of 437 of 645 (65\%) days for which data were available compared with youth in treatment as usual, who were stably housed a mean of 189 of 582 (31\%) days for which data were available, resulting in an adjusted mean difference of 34\% (95\% confidence interval, 24\%--45\%; P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSIONS: "Housing First" was associated with improved housing stability in homeless youth with mental illness. Future research should explore whether adaptations of the model for youth yield additional improvements in housing stability and other outcomes.},

This study examined the unique demographic, clinical, and service use characteristics of homeless youths. Methods: At Home/Chez Soi was a large randomized controlled trial of the Housing First model in five cities in Canada. Of 2,255 participants, 7\% (N=164) were youths ages 18 to 24. Youths were compared with older participants on baseline demographic, clinical, and service use characteristics. Results: More youths than adults had not finished high school (76\% versus 54\%), had a drug use disorder (66\% versus 52\%), and had been assaulted in the past six months (44\% versus 36\%) (all p{$<$}.05). Fewer than half the youths (49\%) had a regular medical doctor, 50\% reported unmet need for health care, and 61\% visited an emergency department in the past six months. Conclusions: This sample of homeless youths with mental illness had low education, high rates of substance use disorders and victimization, and problems accessing services. These findings suggest that youths have trajectories to homelessness and service needs that are distinct from adults and may guide future planning for this vulnerable population.},

In cooperation with professionals and youths, Wolf (2012) developed Houvast (Dutch for `grip'): a strengths based method grounded in scientific and practice evidence. The main aim of Houvast is to improve the quality of life of homeless youths by focusing on their strengths, thus stimulating their capacity for autonomy and self-reliance. The effectiveness and fidelity of Houvast will be tested in ten Dutch services for homeless youth which are randomly allocated to an intervention group (n = 5), or a control group which provides care as usual (n = 5). Measurements of both objective and subjective quality of life and secondary outcomes (mental and physical health, substance use, coping, resilience, psychological needs, care needs, working relationship with the professional and attainment of personal goals) will be conducted among homeless youths (n = 251). Youths in both groups will be interviewed by means of a structured interview at baseline, at time of ending care or after having received care for six months (T1) and at nine months after baseline (T2). Model fidelity will be tested around T1. This study is unique as it includes a large number of homeless youths who are followed for a period of nine months, and because it focuses on a strengths based approach. If the Houvast method proves to be effective in improving quality of life it will be the first evidence-based intervention for homeless youth. Netherlands Trail Register (NTR): NTR3254},

  abstract = {Objective: To test the effectiveness of Houvast: a strengths-based intervention for homeless young adults. Method: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted with 10 Dutch shelter facilities randomly allocated to an intervention and a control group. Homeless young adults were interviewed when entering the facility and when care ended. Repeated-measures analyses and logistic regression analyses were conducted by the principle of intention-to-treat framework (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 251). Results: Improvements were demonstrated on quality of life; satisfaction with family relations, finances, and health; employed or in school; depression; care needs; autonomy; competence, and resilience in both conditions. A higher proportion of homeless young adults who received care according to Houvast were still receiving care at follow-up and successfully completed the trajectory compared to those who received care as usual. Conclusion: Homeless young adults seem to benefit from service provision in general. Further research on the effectiveness of Houvast is needed after sufficient model fidelity has been achieved.},

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study SETTING: Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Baseline interviews were conducted between May 2002 and March 2003 and follow-up interviews, between March and December 2004. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were foster youth aged 17 or 18 years in Illinois, Wisconsin, or Iowa. We invited a random sample of 67\% of eligible Illinois youth and all eligible youth from Wisconsin and Iowa to participate. Researchers interviewed 749 at baseline (94.7\% response) and 643 at follow-up (85.8\%); we excluded 8 participants without housing data (n=635). We included only the 345 emancipated participants in analyses of health care access. MAIN EXPOSURE Housing status after emancipation: stable housing; unstable housing; or homeless. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Multivariate adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of association between main exposure variables with 3 measures of access to care and 2 health outcomes. RESULTS: Among the 345 emancipated participants, 14.2\% experienced homelessness and 39.4\% were unstably housed. In multivariate analysis of emancipated participants, homelessness was associated with being uninsured (AOR, 3.41; 95\% confidence interval, 1.52-7.63) and having unmet need for health care (AOR, 3.26; 95\% confidence interval, 1.40-7.56); it was not associated with not having had ambulatory care. In multivariate analysis of all participants, housing status was not associated with reporting fair or poor health at follow-up or, among women, with having had a pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Having had an episode of homelessness after emancipation is associated with worse health access, but not worse outcomes, among youth emancipated from foster care.},

The aim of this study is to compare two such measures EQ-5D and SF-6D in mental health patients. Baseline data from a Dutch multi-centre randomised trial of 616 patients with mood and/or anxiety disorders were used. Mean and median EQ-5D and SF-6D utilities were compared, both in the total sample and between severity subgroups based on quartiles of SCL-90 scores. Utilities were expected to decline with increased severity. Both EQ-5D and SF-6D utilities differed significantly between patients of adjacent severity groups. Mean utilities increased from 0.51 at baseline to 0.68 at 1.5 years follow-up for EQ-5D and from 0.58 to 0.70 for SF-6D. For all severity subgroups, the mean change in EQ-5D utilities as well as in SF-6D utilities was statistically significant. Standardised response means were higher for SF-6D utilities. We concluded that both EQ-5D and SF-6D discriminated between severity subgroups and captured improvements in health over time. However, the use of EQ-5D resulted in larger health gains and consequent lower cost--utility ratios, especially for the subgroup with the highest severity of mental health problems.

We examined the structure, reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF), a new self-report questionnaire for positive mental health assessment. We expected that the MHC-SF is reliable and valid, and that mental health and mental illness are 2 related but distinct continua. This article draws on data of the LISS panel of CentERdata, a representative panel for Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (N = 1,662). Results revealed high internal and moderate test-retest reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed the 3-factor structure in emotional, psychological, and social well-being. These subscales correlated well with corresponding aspects of well-being and functioning, showing convergent validity. CFA supported the hypothesis of 2 separate yet related factors for mental health and mental illness, showing discriminant validity. Although related to mental illness, positive mental health is a distinct indicator of mental well-being that is reliably assessed with the MHC-SF. {\copyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The literature evaluating the impact of Housing First on criminal justice involvement has not yet been systematically examined. The objective of this systematic review is to examine the impact of Housing First on criminal justice outcomes among homeless people with mental illness. Method: Five electronic databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science) were searched up until July 2018 for randomised and nonrandomised studies of Housing First among homeless people with a serious mental disorder. Results: Five studies were included for a total of 7128 participants. Two studies from a randomised controlled trial found no effect of Housing First on arrests compared to treatment as usual. Other studies compared Housing First to other programs or compared configurations of HF and found reductions in criminal justice involvement among Housing First participants. Conclusions: This systematic review suggests that Housing First, on average, has little impact on criminal justice involvement. Community services such as Housing First are potentially an important setting to put in place strategies to reduce criminal justice involvement. However, forensic mental health approaches such as risk assessment and management strategies and interventions may need to be integrated into existing services to better address potential underlying individual criminogenic risk factors. Further outcome assessment studies would be necessary.},

  abstract = {Background: Smoking rates are significantly higher among young people experiencing homelessness than in the general population. Despite a willingness to quit, homeless youth have little success in doing so on their own, and existing cessation resources tailored to this population are lacking. Homeless youth generally enjoy the camaraderie and peer support that group-based programs offer, but continuous in-person support during a quit attempt can be prohibitively expensive. Objective: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an automated text messaging intervention (TMI) as an adjunct to group-based cessation counseling and provision of nicotine patches to help homeless youth quit smoking. This paper outlines the lessons learned from the implementation of the TMI intervention. Methods: Homeless youth smokers aged 18 to 25 years who were interested in quitting (n=77) were recruited from drop-in centers serving homeless youth in the Los Angeles area. In this pilot randomized controlled trial, all participants received a group-based cessation counseling session and nicotine patches, with 52\% (40/77) randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of text messages to provide additional support for their quit attempt. Participants received text messages on their own phone rather than receiving a study-issued phone for the TMI. We analyzed baseline and follow-up survey data as well as back-end data from the messaging platform to gauge the acceptability and feasibility of the TMI among the 40 participants who received it. Results: Participants had widespread (smart)phone ownership---16.4\% (36/219) were ineligible for study participation because they did not have a phone that could receive text messages. Participants experienced interruptions in their phone use (eg, 44\% [16/36] changed phone numbers during the follow-up period) but reported being able to receive the majority of messages. These survey results were corroborated by back-end data (from the program used to administer the TMI) showing a message delivery rate of about 95\%. Participant feedback points to the importance of carefully crafting text messages, which led to high (typically above 70\%) approval of most text messaging components of the intervention. Qualitative feedback indicated that participants enjoyed the group counseling session that preceded the TMI and suggested including more such group elements into the intervention. Conclusions: The TMI was well accepted and feasible to support smoking cessation among homeless youth. Given high rates of smartphone ownership, the next generation of phone-based smoking cessation interventions for this population should consider using approaches beyond text messages and focus on finding ways to develop effective approaches to include group interaction using remote implementation. Given overall resource constraints and in particular the exigencies of the currently ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, phone-based interventions are a promising approach to support homeless youth, a population urgently in need of effective smoking cessation interventions.},

Second, it includes an overview of the adaptations that were made and the associated rationale for such adaptations. Third, it examines the experiences of participants and staff involved in the cultural adaptation of the Housing Outreach Program Collaborative (HOP-C), a health intervention re-designed to improve physical and mental health outcomes, wellbeing, and social support for formerly homeless Indigenous youth as they secure housing. Qualitative feedback from interviews with 15 participants and eight program staff, in addition to one focus group with an additional six frontline workers, described perceived outcomes of the program's cultural adaptations. Modifications to the overall program structure, specific roles within the program (including counseling services, peer mentorship, cultural services, and case management), and adaptations to general implementation within the health organization providing the intervention were described by participants and staff as effective and helpful adaptations. The focus of Indigenous values at an organizational level led to consistent adaptations in counseling and case management to best meet the unique needs of the youth involved. Based upon participant interviews, recommendations to future adaptations are provided.},

Overall costs of services use by homeless people can be considerable, suggesting the potential for significant cost offsets with HF programs. Our purpose was to provide an updated literature review, from 2007 to the present, focusing specifically on the cost offsets of HF programs. Method: A systematic review was performed on MEDLINE and PsycINFO as well as Google and the Homeless Hub for grey literature. Study characteristics and key findings were extracted from identified studies. Where available, impact on service cost associated with HF (increase or decrease) and net impact on overall costs, taking into account the cost of HF intervention, were noted. Results: Twelve published studies (4 randomized studies and 8 quasi-experimental) and 22 unpublished studies were retained. Shelter and emergency department costs decreased with HF, while impacts on hospitalization and justice costs are more ambiguous. Studies using a pre--post design reported a net decrease in overall costs with HF. In contrast, experimental studies reported a net increase in overall costs with HF. Conclusions: While our review casts doubt on whether HF programs can be expected to pay for themselves, the certainty of significant cost offsets, combined with their benefits for participants, means that they represent a more efficient allocation of resources than traditional services.},

The average fidelity score across five Housing First domains and 10 programs was high in the first year of operation (3.47/4) and higher in the third year of operation (3.62/4). Qualitative interviews (36 key informant interviews and 17 focus groups) revealed that staff expertise, partnerships with other services, and leadership facilitated implementation, while staff turnover, rehousing participants, participant isolation, and limited vocational/educational supports impeded implementation. The findings shed light on important implementation ``drivers'' at the staff, program, and community levels.},

  abstract = {Sexual minority (SM) youth have twice the risk of experiencing homelessness compared to their heterosexual peers. Further, SM youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) report greater depression symptoms and substance use compared to heterosexual YEH. Housing First is an intervention that provides scattered-site individual apartments, without any prerequisite conditions for eligibility, and additional services to support long-term housing sustainment; however, few studies have examined the effectiveness of this approach for SM youth. The current study utilized data from a RCT that provided housing to young mothers experiencing homelessness to examine if treatment effects varied by mothers' sexual identity. Mothers were randomly assigned to services as usual (i.e., provided a referral sheet of all services available in the community; SAU), Housing only (i.e., three months of utility and rental assistance; Housing), or housing and supportive services (integrates independent housing, Strengths-Based Outreach and Advocacy (SBOA), HIV prevention, and substance use/mental health counseling; Housing + SS). Latent growth curve models were estimated to assess how substance use and depression symptoms changed over the 12 months. SM mothers receiving SAU or Housing did not experience a significant change in substance use or depression symptoms. All groups of heterosexual mothers and SM mothers receiving Housing + SS had less substance use and depression symptoms at twelve months, with SM mothers in Housing + SS evidencing a steeper decline in substance use and depression symptoms. This study provides some of the first evidence that Housing First can mitigate the mental health and substance use concerns of SM YEH. Given SM's higher rates of homelessness, substance use, and depression symptoms, Housing First should be further explored as an intervention to address their unique needs.},

Baseline interviews were conducted with 40 young people, aged 14--23 years, in 2004, and follow-up interviews were conducted with 30 research participants successfully `tracked' in 2005--06. By the time of follow-up, 17 of those interviewed had exited homelessness and 13 remained homeless. The article focuses on the latter group with the aim of exploring the processes and experiences associated with their continued homelessness. The findings presented demonstrate the adverse impact of their ongoing movement through emergency services targeting the under-18s, including their greater immersion in drug and criminal lifestyles. A majority had experienced one or more period of incarceration by the time of follow-up, and many were users of adult homeless services. Whilst some dimensions of young people's accounts are suggestive of a process of acculturation to street and hostel life, we argue that their continued homelessness is better explained as a consequence of their ongoing and unresolved transience and, in particular, their continued dependence on emergency hostel accommodation. The implications of the findings for policy and service provision for homeless young people are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: LGBTQ+ youth face many health and societal challenges including issues related to homelessness. Design: A systematic review of qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies. Methods: A search of relevant electronic databases was carried out and included the dates August 2008--August 2018 and limited to academic journals and peer-reviewed empirical studies written in English. Included studies specifically addressed the homeless experiences of youth aged 13--24 years old who identified as LGBTQ+. The PRISMA checklist was used in the review. A quality assessment instrument was used to review all of the selected papers and narrative methods utilised in the synthesis of the research evidence. Results: The search resulted in 319 papers, and after applying distinct inclusion criteria, a total of 14 papers were considered suitable for the systematic review. Following analysis, the four main themes identified were stigma, discrimination and exclusion; mental health issues and substance use; sexual risks and vulnerability; and interventions and supports. Conclusion: LGBTQ+ homeless youth is a major public health concern that has significant consequences for a young person's physical and psychosocial well-being. Relevance to clinical practice: Practitioners need to be aware of the specific health and support requirements of LGBTQ+ youth in relation to homelessness. Inclusive and holistic care plans should exist that are fully responsive to the distinct needs of this group guided by definitive policies and sound clinical research. The implications for future nursing practice are presented and discussed.},

A quasi-experimental mixed methods design with a wait-list comparison was used. Overall results demonstrate that youth who received the DBT intervention (N = 60) demonstrated significant improvement in mental health challenges (e.g. depression, hopelessness, and anxiety), as well as significant improvement in resilience, self-esteem, and social connectedness immediately post-intervention. Participants in the wait-list control did not demonstrate significant improvement on any of the study outcome measures. Furthermore, the gains attained for the intervention group were sustained at four and 10 weeks post-intervention. The qualitative data substantiates these findings; further shedding light on youth's perspectives regarding the impetus for engaging in DBT, the experience of DBT and the impact DBT had on their lives. Results of this study suggests that DBT implemented by front-line clinicians shows promise in meeting the needs of street-involved youth in the community. Moreover, this study demonstrates that it is possible, with the right approach and support, for an interdisciplinary team of youth workers, nurses, and social workers to implement an evidenced-based treatment with youth at community agencies thereby increasing access to needed services to support youth in ultimately exiting the street.},

Ninety-one homeless youth were randomized to receive either targeted cognitive training (cognitive remediation) or general cognitive activation (computer skills training). Cognitive and psychological outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 13 and 26 sessions, and 1 month postintervention. A high dropout rate highlighted the feasibility challenges of treating this population. Intent-to-treat analysis found significant improvements across groups in specific and global measures of cognition and psychological distress, with no significant group differences. Transition-age homeless youth show improvements in cognitive and psychological functioning when engaged in interventions that address their cognitive development. This speaks to the malleability of cognitive skills in this cohort and lays the groundwork for future research to address their cognitive health.},

  abstract = {Implementation science and knowledge translation have developed across multiple disciplines with the common aim of bringing innovations to practice. Numerous implementation frameworks, models, and theories have been developed to target a diverse array of innovations. As such, it is plausible that not all frameworks include the full range of concepts now thought to be involved in implementation. Users face the decision of selecting a single or combining multiple implementation frameworks. To aid this decision, the aim of this review was to assess the comprehensiveness of existing frameworks. A systematic search was undertaken in PubMed to identify implementation frameworks of innovations in healthcare published from 2004 to May 2013. Additionally, titles and abstracts from Implementation Science journal and references from identified papers were reviewed. The orientation, type, and presence of stages and domains, along with the degree of inclusion and depth of analysis of factors, strategies, and evaluations of implementation of included frameworks were analysed. Frameworks were assessed individually and grouped according to their targeted innovation. Frameworks for particular innovations had similar settings, end-users, and `type' (descriptive, prescriptive, explanatory, or predictive). On the whole, frameworks were descriptive and explanatory more often than prescriptive and predictive. A small number of the reviewed frameworks covered an implementation concept(s) in detail, however, overall, there was limited degree and depth of analysis of implementation concepts. The core implementation concepts across the frameworks were collated to form a Generic Implementation Framework, which includes the process of implementation (often portrayed as a series of stages and/or steps), the innovation to be implemented, the context in which the implementation is to occur (divided into a range of domains), and influencing factors, strategies, and evaluations. The selection of implementation framework(s) should be based not solely on the healthcare innovation to be implemented, but include other aspects of the framework's orientation, e.g., the setting and end-user, as well as the degree of inclusion and depth of analysis of the implementation concepts. The resulting generic structure provides researchers, policy-makers, health administrators, and practitioners a base that can be used as guidance for their implementation efforts.},

  abstract = {Effective implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) remains a significant challenge. Numerous existing models and frameworks identify key factors and processes to facilitate implementation. However, there is a need to better understand how individual models and frameworks are applied in research projects, how they can support the implementation process, and how they might advance implementation science. This systematic review examines and describes the research application of a widely used implementation framework, the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework. A systematic literature review was performed to identify and evaluate the use of the EPIS framework in implementation efforts. Citation searches in PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, ERIC, Web of Science, Social Sciences Index, and Google Scholar databases were undertaken. Data extraction included the objective, language, country, setting, sector, EBP, study design, methodology, level(s) of data collection, unit(s) of analysis, use of EPIS (i.e., purpose), implementation factors and processes, EPIS stages, implementation strategy, implementation outcomes, and overall depth of EPIS use (rated on a 1--5 scale). In total, 762 full-text articles were screened by four reviewers, resulting in inclusion of 67 articles, representing 49 unique research projects. All included projects were conducted in public sector settings. The majority of projects (73\%) investigated the implementation of a specific EBP. The majority of projects (90\%) examined inner context factors, 57\% examined outer context factors, 37\% examined innovation factors, and 31\% bridging factors (i.e., factors that cross or link the outer system and inner organizational context). On average, projects measured EPIS factors across two of the EPIS phases (M = 2.02), with the most frequent phase being Implementation (73\%). On average, the overall depth of EPIS inclusion was moderate (2.8 out of 5). This systematic review enumerated multiple settings and ways the EPIS framework has been applied in implementation research projects, and summarized promising characteristics and strengths of the framework, illustrated with examples. Recommendations for future use include more precise operationalization of factors, increased depth and breadth of application, development of aligned measures, and broadening of user networks. Additional resources supporting the operationalization of EPIS are available.},

Forty-three studies were included in the review, 37 of which are from the USA. Included interventions perform better than the usual services at reducing homelessness or improving housing stability in all comparisons. These interventions are: High intensity case management Housing First Critical time intervention Abstinence-contingent housing Non-abstinence-contingent housing with high intensity case management Housing vouchers Residential treatment These interventions seem to have similar beneficial effects, so it is unclear which of these is best with respect to reducing homelessness and increasing housing stability. Plain Language Summary Interventions to reduce homelessness and improve housing stability are effective There are large numbers of homeless people around the world. Interventions to address homelessness seem to be effective, though better quality evidence is required. What is this review about? There are large numbers of homeless people around the world. Recent estimates are over 500,000 people in the USA, 100,000 in Australia and 30,000 in Sweden. Efforts to combat homelessness have been made on national levels as well as at local government levels. This review assesses the effectiveness of interventions combining housing and case management as a means to reduce homelessness and increase residential stability for individuals who are homeless, or at risk of becoming homeless. What is the aim of this review? This Campbell systematic review examines the effectiveness of interventions to reduce homelessness and increase residential stability for individuals who are homeless, or at risk of becoming homeless. Forty-three studies were included in the review, 37 of which are from the USA. What studies are included? Included studies were randomized controlled trials of interventions for individuals who were already, or at-risk of becoming, homeless, and which measured impact on homelessness or housing stability with follow-up of at least one year. A total of 43 studies were included. The majority of the studies (37) were conducted in the United States, with three from the United Kingdom and one each from Australia, Canada, and Denmark. What are the main findings of this review? Included interventions perform better than the usual services at reducing homelessness or improving housing stability in all comparisons. These interventions are: High intensity case management Housing First Critical time intervention Abstinence-contingent housing Non-abstinence-contingent housing with high intensity case management Housing vouchers Residential treatment These interventions seem to have similar beneficial effects, so it is unclear which of these is best with respect to reducing homelessness and increasing housing stability. What do the findings of this review mean? A range of housing programs and case management interventions appear to reduce homelessness and improve housing stability, compared to usual services. However, there is uncertainty in this finding as most the studies have risk of bias due to poor reporting, lack of blinding, or poor randomization or allocation concealment of participants. In addition to the general need for better conducted and reported studies, there are specific gaps in the research with respect to: 1) disadvantaged youth; 2) abstinence-contingent housing with case management or day treatment; 3) non-abstinence contingent housing comparing group vs independent living; 4) Housing First compared to interventions other than usual services, and; 5) studies outside of the USA. How up-to-date is this review? The review authors searched for studies published up to January 2016. This Campbell systematic review was published in February 2018. Executive summary Background The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 25) states that everyone has a right to housing. However, this right is far from being realized for many people worldwide. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are approximately 100 million homeless people worldwide. The aim of this report is to contribute evidence to inform future decision making and practice for preventing and reducing homelessness. Objectives To identify, appraise and summarize the evidence on the effectiveness of housing programs and case management to improve housing stability and reduce homelessness among people who are homeless or at-risk of becoming homeless. Search methods We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the Norwegian Knowledge Centre's handbook. We systematically searched for literature in relevant databases and conducted a grey literature search which was last updated in January 2016. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials that included individuals who were already, or at-risk of becoming, homeless were included if they examined the effectiveness of relevant interventions on homelessness or housing stability. There were no limitations regarding language, country or length of homelessness. Two reviewers screened 2,918 abstracts and titles for inclusion. They read potentially relevant references in full, and included relevant studies in the review. Data collection and analysis We pooled the results and conducted meta-analyses when possible. Our certainty in the primary outcomes was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation for effectiveness approach (GRADE). Results We included 43 relevant studies (described in 78 publications) that examined the effectiveness of housing programs and/or case management services on homelessness and/or housing stability. The results are summarized below. Briefly, we found that the included interventions performed better than the usual services in all comparisons. However, certainty in the findings varied from very low to moderate. Most of the studies were assessed as having high risk of bias due to poor reporting, lack of blinding, or poor randomization and/or allocation concealment of participants. Case management Case management is a process where clients are assigned case managers who assess, plan and facilitate access to health and social services necessary for the client's recovery. The intensity of these services can vary. One specific model is Critical time intervention, which is based on the same principles, but offered in three three-month periods that decrease in intensity. High intensity case management compared to usual services has generally more positive effects: It probably reduces the number of individuals who are homeless after 12-18 months by almost half (RR=0.59, 95\%CI=0.41 to 0.87)(moderate certainty evidence); It may increase the number of people living in stable housing after 12-18 months and reduce the number of days an individual spends homeless (low certainty evidence), however; it may have no effect on the number of individuals who experience some homelessness during a two year period (low certainty evidence). When compared to low intensity case management, it may have little or no effect on time spent in stable housing (low certainty evidence). Critical time intervention compared to usual services may 1) have no effect on the number of people who experience homelessness, 2) lead to fewer days spent homeless, 3) lead to more days spent not homeless and, 4) reduce the amount of time it takes to move from shelter to independent housing (low certainty evidence). Abstinence-contingent housing programs Abstinence-contingent housing is housing provided with the expectation that residents will remain sober. The results showed that abstinence-contingent housing may lead to fewer days spent homeless, compared with usual services (low certainty evidence). Non-abstinence-contingent housing programs Non-abstinence-contingent housing is housing provided with no expectations regarding sobriety of residents. Housing First is the name of one specific non-abstinence-contingent housing program. When compared to usual services Housing First probably reduces the number of days spent homeless (MD=-62.5, 95\%CI=-86.86 to -38.14) and increases the number of days in stable housing (MD=110.1, 95\%CI=93.05 to 127.15) (moderate certainty evidence). In addition, it may increase the number of people placed in permanent housing after 20 months (low certainty evidence). Non-abstinence-contingent housing programs (not specified as Housing First) in combination with high intensity case management may reduce homelessness, compared to usual services (low certainty evidence). Group living arrangements may be better than individual apartments at reducing homelessness (low certainty evidence). Housing vouchers with case management Housing vouchers is a housing allowance given to certain groups of people who qualify. The results showed that it mayreduce homelessness and improve housing stability, compared with usual services or case management (low certainty evidence). Residential treatment with case management Residential treatment is a type of housing offered to clients who also need treatment for mental illness or substance abuse. We found that it mayreduce homelessness and improve housing stability, compared with usual services (low certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions We found that a range of housing programs and case management interventions appear to reduce homelessness and improve housing stability, compared to usual services. The findings showed no indication of housing programs or case management resulting in poorer outcomes for homeless or at-risk individuals than usual services. Aside from a general need for better conducted and reported studies, there are specific gaps in the research. We identified research gaps concerning: 1)Disadvantaged youth; 2) Abstinence-contingent housing with case management or day treatment; 3) Non-abstinence contingent housing, specifically different living arrangements (group vs independent living); 4) Housing First compared to interventions other than usual services, and; 5) All interventions from contexts other than the USA.},

  abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner's instruction manual and a stimulus for changing statistical practice for the better in the biological sciences.},

  abstract = {Young adults experiencing homelessness (YAEH) have been found to have high rates of prior involvement with foster care and juvenile justice, but little is known about whether YAEH differ in their risk behaviors based on exposure to different systems. This study used a dataset of 1426 YAEH from 7 different US cities to examine the historical risk and resilience characteristics of those involved in foster care alone, juvenile justice alone, both systems (dual status), and no system involvement. Logistic regression was used to examine whether different types of childhood system involvement predicted risk behaviors in young adulthood including substance use, trade sex, suicide attempts, unplanned pregnancy, and involvement in the adult criminal justice system. Notably, 57\% of youth had been exposed to one of the systems -- 20\% foster care only (n = 291), 18\% juvenile justice only (n = 254), and 18\% dual status (n = 261). YAEH without a history of system involvement had significantly lower childhood trauma scores and lower rates of lifetime mental health diagnoses compared to all three system involved groups, with dual status youth having the highest rates of both. In relation to risk outcomes, youth with dual status histories had higher odds of trading sex and those with juvenile justice involvement, either alone or as dual status, had higher odds of being arrested after age 18 and of problematic substance use. Results suggest YAEH with prior involvement in child-serving systems have unique risk characteristics that vary by type of system involvement, with dual-system involved youth at particularly high risk. Findings highlight the need for foster care and juvenile justice systems to work collaboratively in providing preventive interventions prior to system exit.},

The research addressed two questions: (a) what are the challenges in planning? and (b) what factors that helped or hindered moving project planning forward? Using qualitative methods, 149 national, provincial, and local stakeholders participated in key informant or focus group interviews. We found that planning entails not only intervention and research tasks, but also relational processes that occur within an ecology of time, local context, and values. More specifically, the relationships between the national team and the project sites can be conceptualized as a collaborative process in which national and local partners bring different agendas to the planning process and must therefore listen to, negotiate, discuss, and compromise with one another. A collaborative process that involves power-sharing and having project coordinators at each site helped to bridge the differences between these two stakeholder groups, to find common ground, and to accomplish planning tasks within a compressed time frame. While local context and culture pushed towards unique adaptations of Housing First, the principles of the Housing First model provided a foundation for a common approach across sites and interventions. The implications of the findings for future planning and research of multi-site, complex, community interventions are noted.},

Fidelity ratings for 10 Housing First programs in five cities were made by an external quality assurance team along five key dimensions of Housing First based on 84 key informant interviews, 10 consumer focus groups, and 100 chart reviews. An additional 72 key informant interviews and 35 focus groups yielded qualitative data on factors that helped or hindered implementation. Overall, the findings show a high degree of fidelity to the model with more than 71\% of the fidelity items being scored higher than 3 on a 4-point scale. The qualitative research found that both delivery system factors, including community and organizational capacity, and support system factors, training and technical assistance, facilitated implementation. Fidelity challenges include the availability of housing, consumer representation in program operations, and limitations to the array of services offered. Factors that accounted for these challenges include low vacancy rates, challenges of involving recently homeless people in program operations, and a lack of services in some of the communities. The study demonstrates how the combined use of fidelity assessment and qualitative methods can be used in implementation evaluation to develop and improve a program.},

The article also presents data associated with young people's lives after discharge. In any discussion of outcomes, both reason for discharge and length of stay play important roles in whether or not an exit is safe. Regardless of these two elements, the places youth move to when leaving programs are crucial to their safety and well-being. The exit can be safe even when a young person is discharged early from a program. This article presents types of exits, as well as status of employment and school enrollment at exit. Some youth and staff-identified lessons gained in the program also are discussed in detail. Types of aftercare services sought by discharged youth are specified. This article also describes any differences in outcomes for youth with and without foster care experience.},

  abstract = {Objective: Individuals experiencing homelessness are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity. The At Home/Chez Soi study provides a unique opportunity to first examine baseline levels of food security among homeless individuals with mental illness and second to evaluate the effect of a Housing First (HF) intervention on food security in this population. Design: At Home/Chez Soi was a 2-year randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of HF compared with usual care among homeless adults with mental illness, stratified by level of need for mental health services (high or moderate). Logistic regressions tested baseline associations between food security (US Food Security Survey Module), study site, sociodemographic variables, duration of homelessness, alcohol/substance use, physical health and service utilization. Negative binomial regression determined the impact of the HF intervention on achieving levels of high or marginal food security over an 18-month follow-up period (6 to 24 months). Setting: Community settings at five Canadian sites (Moncton, Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver). Subjects: Homeless adults with mental illness (n 2148). Results: Approximately 41 \% of our sample reported high or marginal food security at baseline, but this figure varied with gender, age, mental health issues and substance use problems. High need participants who received HF were more likely to achieve marginal or high food security than those receiving usual care, but only at the Toronto and Moncton sites. Conclusions: Our large multi-site study demonstrated low levels of food security among homeless experiencing mental illness. HF showed promise for improving food security among participants with high levels of need for mental health services, with notable site differences.},

Methods:{\enspace} We developed a four-session computer-assisted social network motivational interviewing intervention for homeless adults transitioning into housing. We examined the acceptability of the intervention among staff and residents at an organization that provides permanent supportive housing through iterative rounds of beta testing. Staff were 3 men and 3 women who were residential support staff (i.e., case managers and administrators). Residents were 8 men (7 African American, 1 Hispanic) and 3 women (2 African American, 1 Hispanic) who had histories of AOD and HIV risk behaviors. We conducted a focus group with staff who gave input on how to improve the delivery of the intervention to enhance understanding and receptivity among new residents. We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews and collected self-report satisfaction data from residents. Results:{\enspace} Three themes emerged over the course of the resident interviews. Residents reported that the intervention was helpful in discussing their social network, that seeing the visualizations was more impactful than just talking about their network, and that the intervention prompted thoughts about changing their AOD use and HIV risk networks. Conclusions:{\enspace} This study is the first of its kind that has developed, with input from Housing First staff and residents, a motivational interviewing intervention that targets both the structure and composition of one's social network.

After 48 months, results showed no significant group differences in alcohol and drug use. Treatment first participants were significantly more likely to use treatment services. These findings, in combination with previous reports of much higher rates of housing stability in the housing first group, show that ``dual diagnosed'' adults can remain stably housed without increasing their substance use. Thus, housing first programs favoring immediate housing and consumer choice deserve consideration as a viable alternative to standard care.},

The present study is the first analysis of a randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of HF on unprotected sex among formerly homeless and marginally housed adults with mental illness and complex comorbidities. Methods. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine between-group differences in unprotected sex. Results. Compared with treatment as usual, no association was found between HF and unprotected sex over the 24 months of follow-up. Several other variables were significantly and independently associated with unprotected sex. Conclusion.

  abstract = {Researchers have pointed out the paucity of research investigating long-term consequences of experiencing homelessness in childhood or youth. Limited research has indicated that the experience of homelessness in childhood or youth is associated with adverse adjustment-related consequences in adulthood. Housing First (HF) has acknowledged effectiveness in improving housing outcomes among adults experiencing homelessness and living with serious mental illness, although some HF clients struggle with maintaining housing. The current study was conducted to examine whether the experience of homelessness in childhood or youth increases the odds of poorer housing stability following entry into high-fidelity HF among adults experiencing serious mental illness and who were formerly homeless. Data were drawn from the active intervention arms of a HF randomized controlled trial in Metro Vancouver, Canada. Participants (n = 297) were referred to the study from service agencies serving adults experiencing homelessness and mental illness between October 2009 and June 2011. The Residential Time-Line Follow-Back Inventory was used to measure housing stability. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to estimate the association between first experiencing homelessness in childhood or youth and later housing stability as an adult in HF. Analyses indicated that homelessness in childhood or youth was negatively associated with experiencing housing stability as an adult in HF (aOR = 0.53; 95\% CI = 0.31--0.90). Further supports are needed within HF to increase housing stability among adult clients who have experienced homelessness in childhood or youth. Asking clients about the age they first experienced homelessness may be of clinical utility upon enrollment in HF and may help identify support needs related to developmental experiences. Results further emphasize the importance of intervening earlier in life in childhood and youth before experiencing homelessness or before it becomes chronic. Findings also contribute to a limited knowledge base regarding the adverse long-term consequences of childhood and youth homelessness. Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN57595077 and ISRCTN66721740 .

Method: Coding and thematic analysis of semistructured interviews was based on 2 research questions from participants' perspectives: (a) What changes were perceived over time? (b) What factors facilitated or hindered change? Results: The majority of participants assigned to Housing First reported positive change across multiple domains as a result of stable housing; whereas the majority of treatment as usual participants reported negative or neutral change. Key themes included feelings of security and pride; adjusting to living alone; housing as a learning process; and developing meaningful activity. The sense of security associated with stable housing was the most influential factor that supported change. Factors that helped or hindered change clustered into 4 key themes: the type and quality of services; the cumulative effects of trauma; social ties; and concurrent substance use. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Our findings provide important context to the emerging body of quantitative research on Housing First and recovery from homelessness. Participants' experiences of recovery, particularly as it relates to housing and supports, shifts in identity, and meaningful activity must be acknowledged and incorporated into the design and evaluation of public services, and policy and service reforms.},

  abstract = {Each year, more than 1 million American children and youth experience homelessness (Hammer, Finkelhor, \& Sedlak, 2002; Office of Applied Studies, 2004). The transient nature of this population makes it difficult to study, but youth homelessness has been identified with a number of problematic outcomes as well as a pathway to chronic adult homelessness (Baker Collins, 2013; Chamberlain \& Johnson, 2011). Yet, few empirical studies evaluate the effectiveness of a common intervention for homeless youth---transitional housing. In this paper, we describe the outcomes of homeless youth who participated in a youth-only transitional housing program. We analyze administrative data on 174 youth who entered and exited the Daybreak Transitional Housing program (Daybreak TH) between 2011 and 2014. We find that the majority of Daybreak TH participants were employed at least 20\,h a week at program exit. Youth exited Daybreak TH with higher wages on average, while nearly half achieved educational gains from program entry to exit. Youth who resided in Daybreak TH for 12\,months or longer were more likely to achieve positive program outcomes than youth who entered and exited the program in fewer than 12\,months. Finally, youth who used drugs and alcohol were less likely than their peers to achieve desired program outcomes, as were those who suffered from chronic illnesses or attention deficit, conduct, or disruptive behavior disorders. We conclude with a discussion of policy implications and areas for future research.},

To investigate the impact of an integrated care model on the healthrelated quality of life (HRQOL) of formerly chronically homeless individuals in permanent supportive housing. Methods. From 2014 to 2017, eligible individuals in Houston, Texas (n = 323), were placed in 1 of 2 permanent supportive housing service delivery models. Both models included coordinated care teams. In the intervention group, teams had a single plan of care with the partnering clinic. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and 36-item Short Form Survey were administered at baseline and every 6 months for 30 months. We assessed intervention group emergency department use at 2 years. We evaluated change by using hierarchical linear growth models. Results. There was a significant and clinically meaningful increase in HRQOL in the contingent upon their willingness or commitment to accessing these services.3,4,6 Thus, this model is designed to provide a comprehensive system of care without imposing retribution for those who are unwilling, unready, or unable to take advantage of services. Because service access is voluntary for PSH tenants, the likelihood that they will seek care may depend on the number of barriers that they encounter and the ease with which these barriers are overcome. Asking someone in PSH to prioritize and intervention group, with the intervention group reporting improvement over the address their needs individually, as is done comparison group. Intervention group emergency department use decreased by 70\% in the traditional fragmented health care (no comparison group). system, may be unrealistic for someone Conclusions. Those in the intervention group with a single, coordinated plan of care reported significant and clinically meaningful increases in their HRQOL. Public Health Implications. Coordinated care models have potential to reduce societal costs and increase HRQOL, providing a financial and humanitarian justification for the continued investment in collaborative care in permanent supportive housing.

Using a state-level integrated administrative database, we identified 1,202 emerging adults in Washington State who exited foster care between July 2010 and June 2012. Initial bivariate analyses were conducted to assess the association between candidate predictive factors and an indicator of homelessness in a 12-month follow-up period. After deploying a stepwise regression process, the final logistic regression model included 15 predictive factors. Youth who were parents, who had recently experienced housing instability, or who were African American had approximately twice the odds of experiencing homelessness in the year after exiting foster care. In addition, youth who had experienced disrupted adoptions, had multiple foster care placements (especially in congregate care settings), or had been involved with the juvenile justice system were more likely to become homeless. In contrast, youth were less likely to experience homelessness if they had ever been placed with a relative while in foster care or had a high cumulative grade point average relative to their peers.},

This understudied area has been identified as one of the most significant translational research problems. Adding to this challenge is uncertainty regarding the extent to which intervention adaptation and evolution are necessary to address the needs of populations that differ from those in which interventions were originally tested or implemented. This review critically examines and discusses conceptual and methodological issues in studying sustainability, summarizes the multilevel factors that have been found to influence the sustainability of interventions in a range of public health and health care settings, and highlights key areas for future research.},

We present a summary of the major conceptual issues considered when choosing items for the social support battery, describe the items, and present findings based on data from 2987 patients (ages 18 and older). Multitrait scaling analyses supported the dimensionality of four functional support scales (emotional/informational, tangible, affectionate, and positive social interaction) and the construction of an overall functional social support index. These support measures are distinct from structural measures of social support and from related health measures. They are reliable (all Alphas {$>$}0.91), and are fairly stable over time. Selected construct validity hypotheses were supported.},

  abstract = {Cet article pr{\'e}sente les r{\'e}sultats d'une {\'e}tude administrative r{\'e}alis{\'e}e au CIUSSS de la Capitale-Nationale, en r{\'e}ponse {\`a} l'orientation 1 du plan d'action du minist{\`e}re de la Sant{\'e} et des Services sociaux portant sur les fugues en centre de r{\'e}adaptation (Gouvernement du Qu{\'e}bec, 2018). Le premier volet de cette {\'e}tude identifie les caract{\'e}ristiques des jeunes h{\'e}berg{\'e}s dans un centre de r{\'e}adaptation et dans un foyer de groupe (               n               = 148). Les r{\'e}sultats d{\'e}montrent des fr{\'e}quences {\'e}lev{\'e}es de jeunes qui pr{\'e}sentent un trouble d{\'e}ficitaire de l'attention avec ou sans hyperactivit{\'e} (TDAH), un probl{\`e}me de sant{\'e} mentale et qui prennent une m{\'e}dication. Des analyses comparatives selon le genre r{\'e}v{\`e}lent que les gar{\c c}ons pr{\'e}sentent davantage de probl{\`e}mes de comportement tels que la violence, la consommation, et la d{\'e}linquance, alors que la victimisation est plus pr{\'e}sente chez les filles. Le second volet repose sur une analyse des besoins, conduite aupr{\`e}s des jeunes h{\'e}berg{\'e}s (               n               = 80), en plus de sonder les adultes impliqu{\'e}s aupr{\`e}s d'eux (               n               = 141). Cette analyse r{\'e}v{\`e}le que les besoins identifi{\'e}s varient selon le type de r{\'e}pondants mais se situent surtout dans les sph{\`e}res de vie suivantes~: sant{\'e} mentale, autonomie des jeunes et transition {\`a} la vie adulte, march{\'e} du travail, perception de soi, relations familiales. Ces besoins sont d'ailleurs en concordance avec les probl{\'e}matiques v{\'e}cues par les jeunes.                        ,                             This article presents the results of an administrative study conducted at the CIUSSS de la Capitale-Nationale in response to Orientation 1 of the Quebec Ministry of Health and Social Services' action plan on runaways in residential care (Gouvernement du Qu{\'e}bec, 2018). The first part of this study documents the characteristics of youths in residential care (               n               = 148), based on an analysis of their child protection services files. The results show high frequencies of youth having ADHD, experiencing mental health problems and taking medication. Gender-based analyses reveal that males exhibit more behavioural problems such as violence, substance abuse and delinquency, while victimization is more prevalent among females. The second part of this study consists of an analysis of the needs of youths in residential care, as reported by these youths (               n               = 80) and the adults involved with them (               n               = 141). This analysis reveals that the identified needs vary according to the type of respondent, while falling mainly into the following areas~: mental health, youth autonomy and transition to adulthood, the labour market, self-perception and family relationships. These needs are in line with the problems experienced by these youths in residential care.                        ,                             Este art{\'i}culo presenta los resultados de un estudio administrativo realizado en el CIUSSS de la Capitale-Nationale, en respuesta a la Orientaci{\'o}n 1 del plan de acci{\'o}n del Ministerio de Salud y Servicios Sociales sobre las fugas en centros de rehabilitaci{\'o}n (Gobierno de Quebec, 2018). La primera parte de este estudio identifica las caracter{\'i}sticas de los j{\'o}venes que viven en un centro de rehabilitaci{\'o}n y en un hogar grupal (               n               = 148). Los resultados muestran altas frecuencias de j{\'o}venes con TDAH, problemas de salud mental y que toman medicaci{\'o}n. Los an{\'a}lisis comparativos basados en el g{\'e}nero revelan que los chicos presentan m{\'a}s problemas de comportamiento, como violencia, consumo de drogas y delincuencia, mientras que la victimizaci{\'o}n es m{\'a}s frecuente entre las chicas. La segunda parte se basa en un an{\'a}lisis de necesidades realizado con los j{\'o}venes de los centros de acogida (               n               = 80), adem{\'a}s de encuestar a los adultos que trabajan con ellos (               n               = 141). Este an{\'a}lisis revela que las necesidades identificadas var{\'i}an seg{\'u}n el tipo de encuestado, pero se sit{\'u}an principalmente en los siguientes {\'a}mbitos de la vida~: salud mental, autonom{\'i}a de los j{\'o}venes y transici{\'o}n a la edad adulta, mercado laboral, autopercepci{\'o}n y relaciones familiares. Estas necesidades coinciden con los problemas que experimentan los j{\'o}venes.},

Using data from the WHOQOL-BREF field trials, the objectives of this work are to examine the performance of the WHOQOL-BREF as an integrated instrument, and to test its main psychometric properties. The WHOQOL-BREF is a 26-item version of the WHOQOL-100 assessment. Its psychometric properties were analysed using cross-sectional data obtained from a survey of adults carried out in 23 countries (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 11,830). Sick and well respondents were sampled from the general population, as well as from hospital, rehabilitation and primary care settings, serving patients with physical and mental disorders and with respect to quotas of important socio-demographic variables. The WHOQOL-BREF self-assessment was completed, together with socio-demographic and health status questions. Analyses of internal consistency, item--total correlations, discriminant validity and construct validity through confirmatory factor analysis, indicate that the WHOQOL-BREF has good to excellent psychometric properties of reliability and performs well in preliminary tests of validity. These results indicate that overall, the WHOQOL-BREF is a sound, cross-culturally valid assessment of QOL, as reflected by its four domains: physical, psychological, social and environment.},

This study pilot-tested a comprehensive intervention with 15 homeless women and their 2- to 6-year-old children, recruited from a local family shelter. All participants were offered integrated intervention with three major components. The first component was housing which included 3 months of rental and utility assistance, and these services were not contingent upon women's abstinence from drugs or alcohol. The second and third components included 6 months of case management services and an evidence-based substance abuse treatment (Community Reinforcement Approach; CRA). Analysis revealed that women showed reductions in substance use (F2,22 = 3.63; p {$<$} .05), homelessness (F2,24 = 25.31; p {$<$} .001), and mental health problems (F2,20 = 8.5; p {$<$} .01). Further, women reported reduced internalizing (F2,22 = 4.08; p {$<$} .05) and externalizing problems (F2,24 = 7.7; p = .01) among their children. The findings suggest that the intervention is a promising approach to meet the multiple needs of this vulnerable population. These positive outcomes support the need for future research to replicate the findings with a larger sample using a randomized design.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} Homeless youth experience high rates of substance use disorders, exposures to violence, mental and physical health conditions, and mortality. They have been particularly affected by the opioid crisis. However, no study to date has used a randomized controlled design to test preventive interventions of opioid and other drug use among this vulnerable population. Resolution of youth homelessness through housing and supportive services including prevention services, often referred to as ``Housing First,'' has great potential to reduce the likelihood for the development of an opioid use disorder as well as other problem behaviors associated with living on the streets. Housing First has been tested through randomized trials among homeless adults with mental health and substance use disorders, but has not been empirically tested for opioid prevention among homeless youth. Methods:{\enspace} Homeless youth will be recruited from a drop-in shelter site frequented by disconnected youth; they will be screened for eligibility, including current homelessness, age 18--24 years, and not currently meeting criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). In a controlled trial, 240 youth will then be randomized to one of two conditions, (1) housing\,+\,opioid and related risk prevention services, or (2) opioid and related risk prevention services alone. This project utilizes existing efficacious models of prevention to address opioid-related risks, including motivational interviewing, strengths-based outreach and advocacy, and an HIV risk preventive intervention. Follow-up will be conducted at 3, 6, 9 and 12-months post-baseline. The economic cost of each intervention will be determined to support implementation decisions with other providers and their funders. Discussion:{\enspace} This study will provide essential information for researchers and providers on the efficacy of housing\,+\,opioid and related risk prevention services in an RCT for effects on opioid use and mechanisms underlying change. Because youth experiencing homelessness are at increased risk for a variety of adverse outcomes, the proposed intervention may produce substantial health care benefits to the youths and society at large.},

  abstract = {Background: Housing First has become a popular treatment model for homeless adults with mental illness, yet little is known about program participants' early experiences or trajectories. This study used a mixed methods design to examine participant changes in selected domains 6 months after enrolment in a Canadian field trial of Housing First. Methods: The study sample included 301 participants receiving the Housing First intervention at the Toronto site of the At Home/Chez Soi project. This study used a pre-post design to compare quantitative 6-month outcome data to baseline values in key domains and multivariate regression to identify baseline demographic, clinical or service use variables associated with observed changes in these domains. In addition, qualitative data exploring participant and service provider perspectives and experiences was collected via stakeholder interviews and focus groups, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: The majority (60 to 72\%) of participants followed the expected trajectory of improvement, with the remaining experiencing difficulties in community integration, mental health symptom severity, substance use, community functioning and quality of life 6 months after program enrolment. Diagnosis of psychotic disorder was associated with a reduction in quality of life from baseline to 6-months, while substance use disorders were associated with reduced mental illness symptoms and substance use related problems and an improvement in quality of life. Participants housed in independent housing at 6-months had greater improvements in community integration and quality of life, and greater reduction in mental illness symptoms, compared to those not independently housed. The quality of the working alliance was positively associated with improvements in physical and psychological community integration and quality of life. Qualitative data provided a unique window into the loneliness and isolation experienced by Housing First participants, as well as problems related to substance use and a need for life skills training and support. Conclusions: Additional strategies can help support Housing First participants in the early stages of program participation and address potential causes of early difficulties, including lack of life skills and social isolation. This study highlights the importance of early and ongoing evaluation, monitoring and program adaptations to address consumer support needs.

  abstract = {Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a widespread and devastating phenomenon resulting in a myriad of long-term consequences for survivors and their children. IPV victimization not only has negative health and economic consequences, it has also been linked to homelessness and housing instability. In response, the Domestic Violence Housing First (DVHF) model is being used in some domestic violence (DV) agencies to help survivors attain safe and stable housing. The model includes using individualized advocacy and/or flexible funding to help survivors meet these goals. Using a longitudinal, quasi-experimental design, the current study involved conducting interviews with survivors and examining agency records to investigate the effectiveness of this model. We hypothesized that survivors who received DVHF would experience less re-abuse and greater housing stability over 12\,months compared to those who received services as usual (SAU). The sample included 345 IPV survivors who had been homeless or unstably housed when they approached one of five DV programs for help. Interviews were spaced 6\,months apart (when survivors first sought services as well as 6\,months and 12\,months later). Longitudinal analyses showed that survivors who received the DVHF model reported greater improvements in housing stability at both the 6-month and 12-month time points compared to those receiving SAU. At the 12-month time point, survivors who had received DVHF reported decreased physical, psychological, and economic abuse, as well as the use of their children against them as a form of abuse. This study adds to a growing body of evidence supporting this model's effectiveness and adds to our understanding of factors impacting the long-term housing stability and safety for IPV survivors.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Endogenous opioidergic systems (particularly beta-endorphin and mu opioid receptors [MOP-R]) and cannabinoid systems (including CB1 receptors [CB1R]) are critically involved in alcohol reward and addiction. Our recently published study suggests that hypothalamic POMC is essential for alcohol ``binge'' drinking in mice, via a beta-endorphin/MOP-R mediated mechanism. The present study was undertaken to determine whether changes in neuronal activity of POMC neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) are involved in CB1R-induced alcohol drinking. Methods: Adult female Pomc-Cre mice (mixed FVB/N, C57BL/6J and 129 background), nPE wildtype sibling mice and POMC-EGFP mice (both C57BL/6J background) exposed to a drinking-in-thedark (DID) protocol (1-bottle, 15\% ethanol, 4-h/session) developed stable alcohol consumption after 4 days, reaching levels comparable (or even higher in Pomc-Cre) to wild-type C57BL/6J mice. CB1R agonist WIN-55,212-2 [WIN] (0.1--0.5 mg/kg) was administered acutely before the DID session on day 5, following selective CB1R antagonist AM251 (0.1 mg/kg) or MOP-R antagonist naltrexone (1 mg/kg) pretreatment (15 min before WIN). Two weeks after inhibitory DREADD (AAVhM4Di-mCherry) injection into the ARC, Pomc-Cre mice were exposed to DID for 4 days, and then received clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, 0.3 mg/kg) 15 min before WIN on day 5. Results: In Pomc-Cre mice, acute WIN dose-dependently (0.1--0.5 mg/kg) increased alcohol intake and the effect of WIN (0.5 mg/kg) was blunted by either AM251 or naltrexone (neither drug alone altered alcohol intake per se), suggesting that the promoting effect on alcohol drinking by CB1R stimulation required the activation of MOP-R and CB1R systems. CNO-driven activation of inhibitory DREADD in Pomc-Cre mice prevented WIN-induced drinking after 2 hours of alcohol access, suggesting that the stimulatory effect of CB1R depended on POMC neural activation. nPE{\`A}/{\`A} mice (targeted deletion of neuronal Pomc enhancers leading to the loss of ARC Pomc expression) had lower basal and blunted response to WIN-induced drinking, confirming a functional role of ARC POMC in regulating alcohol intake. In POMC-EGFP mice, increased POMC mRNA levels in the hypothalamus after WIN-evoked alcohol drinking were paralleled by an increased number of POMC-EGFP neurons in ARC. Conclusion: ARC POMC neurons are involved in alcohol ``binge'' drinking promoted by CB1R activation.},

  abstract = {Background: Although the risk factors associated with young people entering and becoming entrenched in street life have been thoroughly investigated, peer-reviewed evidence is scarce to nonexistent for rigorous interventions targeting social integration outcomes for young people who have experienced homelessness. From the limited research that has been done, emerging evidence signals that, although structural supports such as subsidized housing and social service providers are important, these resources alone are insufficient to help young people integrate into the mainstream society. Objective: The overarching aim of this study is to assess whether and how rent subsidies and mentorship influence social integration outcomes for formerly homeless young people living in market rent housing in 3 Canadian cities. The primary outcome measures for this study are community integration (psychological and physical) and self-esteem at 18 months. Secondary outcomes include social connectedness, hope, and academic and vocational participation at 18 months. Exploratory outcomes include income, perceived housing quality, engulfment, psychiatric symptoms, and participant perspectives of intervention barriers and facilitators. Methods: This is a convergent mixed methods, open-label, 2-arm parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 1:1 allocation embedded within a community-based participatory action research (CBPAR) framework. The intervention will provide 24 young people (aged 16-26 years), who have transitioned out of homelessness and into market rent housing within the past year, with rent subsidies for 24 months. Half of the young people will also be randomly assigned an adult mentor who has been recruited and screened by 1 of our 3 community partners. Data collection will occur every 6 months, and participants will be followed for 30 months. Results: Ethical approval for this study has been obtained from the Providence, St Joseph's, and St Michael's Healthcare Research Ethics Board (number 18-251). Enrollment took place from April 2019 to September 2019. Preliminary analysis of the baseline quantitative and qualitative data is underway. Conclusions: This pilot RCT will be the first to test the impact of economic and social support on meaningful social integration for formerly homeless young people living in market rent housing. We believe that the mixed methods design will illuminate important contextual factors that must be considered if the intervention is to be scaled up and replicated elsewhere. Importantly, the CBPAR framework will incorporate the perspectives of the community, including formerly homeless young people, who are in the best position to determine what might work best in the context of their lives.

In their daily lives, these youth confront negative social perceptions and harrowing circumstances related to survival, which may present challenges to the construction of a meaningful, coherent identity. Using the theoretical notion of narrative engagement (Hammack \& Cohler, 2009), this study explores how youth experiencing homelessness make meaning of their lived experiences and engage with dominant discourses about homelessness that stigmatize and devalue them. A narrative analysis of 4 case studies, drawn from in-depth life story interviews with 11 unhoused youth in the United States, suggests that despite experience of struggle and loss, participants demonstrated the ability to (a) resist contamination through the construction of redemptive narratives, grounded in agency and resilience; and (b) resist dominant narratives about homelessness by attributing their circumstances to external causes and by critiquing institutions and figures perceived as holding power. In doing so, participants refused to adopt a ``criminal'' or ``client'' master narrative of homeless identity, instead affirming the value and worth of their knowledge, experiences, and identities. This study reveals the active agency of homeless youth to construct counternarratives in which they may restory their identities to find resilience in the margins.},

Given that Indigenous pathways to homelessness can differ from non-Indigenous youth, interventions that address homelessness must also adapt to meet diverse needs. The Housing Outreach Program Collaborative (HOP-C) is a tertiary prevention intervention designed to provide congruent housing and peer and mental health supports for youth experiencing homelessness in Toronto, Ontario. Less is known regarding its adaptability to adequately serve Indigenous youth in northwestern Ontario. This study assessed the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of an adaptation of the HOP-C North program for transitional aged Indigenous youth exiting homelessness in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Participants completed premeasures (n = 15) and postmeasures (n = 8) as well as qualitative interviews regarding their experiences in the program. Qualitative interviews were also conducted with staff (n = 14) engaged in implementing the program. After completing the HOP-C North program, participants reported improvements in a number of outcomes, including increased educational enrollment, attainment of employment, reduced hospitalizations, and increased engagement in clinical mental health services. Specific program aspects that participants found helpful included increased program flexibility, accessibility, emphasis on relationships, relevance of programming, fostering participant autonomy, and an adaptive approach to program implementation. These findings suggest that the HOP-C North model, when adapted, is a helpful program for Indigenous youth. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Subjects stratified by smoking status (79 = smokers, 56 = nonsmokers) were randomized in a double blind fashion to receive mecamylamine (10 mg/day as 2.5 mg tablets, two tablets po bid) or matching placebo (two placebo tablets po bid) for 12 weeks; all participants also received Medical Management administered by an experienced research registered nurse. Results: All drinking outcomes (heavy drinking days,\# drinking days, drinks per drinking day) decreased significantly with treatment p {$<$}= 0.01. Rate of abstinence in this study was low (26.5\%) with no differences between medication groups (p = 0.61) or between smokers and non-smokers (p = 0.89). There was no main effect for medication on drinking days (p = 0.96), drinks per drinking days (p = 0.83), or heavy drinking days (p = 0.91). There was a signficant main effect of smoking for drinking days (p = 0.05) (smokers reported fewer drinking days), but not for heaving drinking days or drinks per drinking days. There was no significant medication by smoking interaction for drinking days (p = 0.80), heavy drinking days (0.84) or drinks per drinking days (p = 0.65). The average number of cigarrets per day was lower during treatment compared to baseline, atlhought this was not statistically significantly. There were no differences in the number of cigarrettes smoked between the mecamylamine group (mean = 9.4) and the placebo group (mean = 11.1). Other secondary outcomes and possible moderators, such as alcohol and smoking characteristics will be explored. Conclusion: Preliminary analyses suggest that the non-competitive nicontinic antagonist, mecamylamine, was not more effective than placebo in reducing drinking and was not associated with an increase in smoking.

Yet few programs exist for this population that are both effective and can be easily incorporated into settings serving this population. This pilot cluster cross-over randomized controlled trial evaluates AWARE, a voluntary four session group-based motivational interviewing (MI) intervention to reduce AOD use and sexual risk behavior. We evaluated AWARE with 200 homeless young adults using drop-in center services in Los Angeles County (mean age = 21.8 years; 73\% male; 79\% heterosexual; 31\% non-Hispanic White, 25\% African American, 24\% Hispanic, 21\% multiracial/other). Surveys were completed at baseline and three months after program completion. Retention in the AWARE program was excellent (79\% attended multiple sessions) and participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the program. AWARE participants self-reported positive change in their past 3 month and past 30 day alcohol use (ps {$\leq$} 0.05), motivation to change drug use (ps b 0.05), and condom use self-efficacy (p = 0.05) compared to the control group. Among those with multiple sex partners, AWARE participants showed a decrease in unprotected sexual events (p b 0.05), whereas the control group did not. Results from this pilot evaluation are promising, suggesting that a brief group-MI risk reduction intervention can be effective in helping homeless young adults make positive changes in their alcohol and condom use. Further work is needed to more fully evaluate the efficacy of AWARE on AOD behavior and sexual risk behavior outcomes.},

Few risk reduction programs for this population have been developed and rigorously evaluated, particularly those that address both of these interrelated behaviors, use a collaborative and non-judgmental approach, and are feasible to deliver in settings where homeless young people seek services. This paper describes the protocol of a study evaluating a four-session Motivational Interviewing (MI)-based group risk reduction intervention for this population. The protocol has been shown to be efficacious in pilot work over 3 months with 200 homeless young adults [1]. The current study seeks to refine the intervention protocol and evaluate the program on a larger scale.                                         Methods/design               In a cluster-cross-over randomized controlled trial, 18--25~year olds will receive the AWARE risk reduction program (n\,=\,200) or standard care (n\,=\,200) at one of three drop-in centers serving homeless youth in the Los Angeles area. We will evaluate intervention effects on primary outcomes of AOD use and sexual risk behavior, as well as secondary outcomes of health-related quality of life and social stability, over a 12-month period.                                         Discussion               This project has the potential to fill a significant gap in prevention services by demonstrating that a brief intervention, feasible to deliver within settings where young people experiencing homelessness typically seeks services, can significantly reduce the interrelated problems of AOD use and sexual risk behavior.

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} Studies indicate high rates of substance use among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH). Further, the social networks of YEH, although multi-dimensional in composition, are largely comprised of other YEH, substance users, and individuals who do not provide the youth with tangible or emotional support. For YEH who have the opportunity to enter a housing program, helping them to reduce their substance use and strengthen their prosocial supportive connections during this critical transition period may increase their stability and reduce their risk of reentering homelessness. The goal of this study is to pilot test a brief motivational network intervention (MNI), delivered by case managers, to help former YEH who have recently transitioned to a housing program reduce their substance use and strengthen their prosocial supportive connections. Methods/design:{\enspace} Up to 60 residents of housing programs in the Los Angeles area will be randomized to receive four sessions of usual case manager support or four sessions of case manager support\,+\,MNI. Each MNI session consists of three parts: (1) identifying two goals that are most important for the resident over the next year (e.g., get or keep a job, finish or stay in school, reduce substance use); (2) a network interview with the resident to capture network data pertaining to their interactions in the past 2 weeks; and (3) a discussion between the case manager and the resident of the resulting network visualizations, conducted in a Motivational Interviewing (MI) style, and what role the resident's network may play in reaching their most important goals over the next year. Discussion:{\enspace} This study addresses a critical gap by pilot testing a computer-assisted MNI, delivered using MI techniques, that can help case managers work with recent YEH to reduce substance use and increase permanent supportive connections during the critical transitional period from homelessness to housing.

  abstract = {Purpose: Compulsive-like alcohol drinking (CLAD), where alcohol intake persists despite adverse consequences, is a core facet of alcohol use disorder and a major clinical obstacle to successful treatment. Recent work has shed light on underlying circuit and neurochemical mechanisms, but much remains unknown. Previously, we described that anterior insula (AINS), a central mediator of emotion and motivation, is critical for promoting CLAD in rodents, and heavy human drinkers show similar insula-circuit recruitment when responding for alcohol under threat of shock. However, global AINS inhibition reduces CLAD and AlcOnly, suggesting that parallel AINS pathways may mediate aversion-resistant versus regular alcohol. One major obstacle to understanding AINS importance for alcohol drinking is the lack of information on in vivo AINS firing patterns during intake, which could shed critical light on the nature of AINS activity that promotes intake. Methods: Here, we used 32-electrode multi-wire electrophysiology implants to record single-unit activity in right AINS from 15 rats, with two sessions per rat of each of the three drinking condition (AlcOnly; CLAD with 10mg/L or 60mg/L quinine in alcohol). DATA is from {\textasciitilde}400 neurons per drinking condition. Results: Studies implicate AINS in both initiation and sustaining of motivated responding, and we find a confluence of these patterns. AINS neurons with a large firing increase at initiation of intake (Initial Response cells) showed significantly larger activity across the rest of licking during CLAD relative to AlcOnly. In contrast, neurons selected by phenotype of sustained firing increases or decreases showed no differences across conditions. There were also significant difference in the first seconds of bottle access under the higher challenge. Conclusions: AINS cells can show sustained firing across drinking, but only neurons with strong firing at licking onset show greater sustained responding under compulsion-like conditions. We provide critical new information about how AINS, crucial for sustaining alcohol drinking, expresses the drive for alcohol.},

Intensive qualitative interviews were audio taped and transcribed with 40 homeless young adults 19 to 21years of age in the Midwest. Findings show that family backgrounds were generally characterized by substance use, child maltreatment, and witnessing violence, all of which provide social context for understanding why so many of these young people opted to leave home in search of an alternative living situation. The current findings also reveal that while some young adults ran away from home as adolescents, others were ``pushed out'' (i.e., told to leave), or removed by state agencies. Current study findings illustrate that young adults' trajectories are marked by multiple living arrangements such as home, foster care, detention facility, and drug rehabilitation. Overall, study results show that young adults' family histories place them on trajectories for early independence marked by multiple transitions and numerous living situations, culminating in lack of a permanent residence to call home.},

  abstract = {Background: Youth often experience unique pathways into homelessness, such as family conflict, child abuse and neglect. Most research has focused on adult homeless populations, yet youth have specific needs that require adapted interventions. This review aims to synthesize evidence on interventions for youth and assess their impacts on health, social, and equity outcomes. Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and other databases from inception until February 9, 2018 for systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials on youth interventions conducted in high income countries. We screened title and abstract and full text for inclusion, and data extraction were completed in duplicate, following the PRISMA-E (equity) review approach. Results: Our search identified 11,936 records. Four systematic reviews and 18 articles on randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Many studies reported on interventions including individual and family therapies, skill-building, case management, and structural interventions. Cognitive behavioural therapy led to improvements in depression and substance use, and studies of three family-based therapies reported decreases in substance use. Housing first, a structural intervention, led to improvements in housing stability. Many interventions showed inconsistent results compared to services as usual or other interventions, but often led to improvements over time in both the intervention and comparison group. The equity analysis showed that equity variables were inconsistently measured, but there was data to suggest differential outcomes based upon gender and ethnicity. Conclusions: This review identified a variety of interventions for youth experiencing homelessness. Promising interventions include cognitive behavioural therapy for addressing depression, family-based therapy for substance use outcomes, and housing programs for housing stability. Youth pathways are often unique and thus prevention and treatment may benefit from a tailored and flexible approach.},

The resulting 12-item short-form (SF-12) achieved multiple R squares of 0.911 and 0.918 in predictions of the SF-36 Physical Component Summary and SF-36 Mental Component Summary scores, respectively. Scoring algorithms from the general population used to score 12-item versions of the two components (Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary) achieved R squares of 0.905 with the SF-36 Physical Component Summary and 0.938 with the SF-36 Mental Component Summary when cross-validated in the Medical Outcomes Study. Test-retest (2-week) correlations of 0.89 and 0.76 were observed for the 12-item Physical Component Summary and the 12-item Mental Component Summary, respectively, in the general US population (n = 232). Twenty cross-sectional and longitudinal tests of empirical validity previously published for the 36-item short-form scales and summary measures were replicated for the 12-item Physical Component Summary and the 12-item Mental Component Summary, including comparisons between patient groups known to differ or to change in terms of the presence and seriousness of physical and mental conditions, acute symptoms, age and aging, self-reported 1-year changes in health, and recovery from depression. In 14 validity tests involving physical criteria, relative validity estimates for the 12-item Physical Component Summary ranged from 0.43 to 0.93 (median = 0.67) in comparison with the best 36-item short-form scale. Relative validity estimates for the 12-item Mental Component Summary in 6 tests involving mental criteria ranged from 0.60 to 1.07 (median = 0.97) in relation to the best 36-item short-form scale. Average scores for the 2 summary measures, and those for most scales in the 8-scale profile based on the 12-item short-form, closely mirrored those for the 36-item short-form, although standard errors were nearly always larger for the 12-item short-form.},

The loss of supports and structures offered by schools, families, and child- and family-oriented health and social services means that the emerging adult must rely more on his/her own resources in a less structured environment. This increased agency in the context of less structure is occurring as the human brain is still developing higher-level capacities such as executive functioning. The person-context interactions during EA are many and complex, leading to multiple different pathways through emerging adulthood. Those with sufficient economic and adult supports as well as personal resources and maturity will be more likely to choose well and embark on a positive trajectory during EA. Those lacking these resources, or those with physical and mental health or intellectual disabilities, may struggle during this period and experience a negative trajectory in the spheres of education, vocation, relationships, and health status. The life course health science of EA requires more detailed and deeper analysis of the relationship between family, peers, and societal supports and personal internal resources in order to help promote successful developmental trajectories during~EA.},

Proponents of this model argue for its strength by drawing on research evidence. In other words, the use of HF is deemed an `evidence-based practice.' Despite this, a strong synthesis of the evidence used to champion these models is lacking. This article seeks to address this gap, with a review focused on outcomes associated with participation in HF programs. Specifically, we investigate the details of program design coupled with specific outcomes, so as to better inform future action and research. We conclude that the research forming the evidence base for HF is methodologically strong. However, additional research is needed to determine the benefits of HF for diverse populations. Additional research is also required to conclusively determine the impact of HF on substance use and psychiatric treatment. We recommend that policy-makers consider the needs of local populations when developing and implementing HF programing.},
