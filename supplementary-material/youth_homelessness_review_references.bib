Likewise, the prevalence of all mental health problems assessed in street youth is greater than that in non-street youth. Pregnancy is more frequent among street than household youth. Street youth also experience high levels of violence: a large proportion report physical abuse or assault. Finally, mortality is about 11 times the expected rate based on age and sex and is mainly caused by suicide and drug overdose., Conclusion: Current research results are useful to orient public health interventions for street youth, but further epidemiologic research is needed. The need for Canadian data is particularly acute in specific areas including mental health, violence, pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections such as, for example, herpes infection and syphilis., MeSH terms: Homeless youth; communicable diseases; sexually transmitted diseases; mental disorders; violence; mortality.},

The EFA showed that the CD-RISC had an unstable factor structure across two demographically equivalent samples. A series of empirically driven modifications was made, resulting in a 10-item unidimensional scale that demonstrated good internal consistency and construct validity. Overall, the 10-item CD-RISC displays excellent psychometric properties and allows for efficient measurement of resilience.},

Eight projects in a national, cooperative study collected new data at baseline, 6, and 12 months using a set of common measures as well as site-specific instruments. The pooled sample consisted of 1,381 persons in treatment for mental illness or substance abuse (or both), of which 84\% had a history of homelessness. The analyses employed classical and Rasch methods to examine the MCSI's content validity, internal consistency and item quality, test/retest reliability, dimensionality, appropriateness for the sample, construct validity, and responsiveness to change. This 14-item scale was found to be a reliable and valid measure of psychological symptoms in this sample. Its content was consistent with other symptom measures, its high internal consistency and test-retest coefficients supported its reliability, its relationships to other measures indicated that it had good construct validity, and it was responsive to change. We conclude that the MCSI performed similarly to longer, more widely used measures of psychological symptomatology and could be useful in other studies targeting homeless adults with severe mental illness, substance use disorders, or both.},

  abstract = {Background: Evidence on the effectiveness of programs serving unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness remains limited and mixed, and we know little about the factors that contribute to participant engagement and program implementation across contexts. Objective: In this meta-synthesis of current findings on youth interventions, we explore the following research questions: (1) What are common programmatic or contextual factors that researchers and/or practitioners identify as contributing to the successful implementation of an intervention for homeless and unstably housed youth? and (2) What programmatic or contextual factors do youth and practitioners identify as hindering suc\- cessful implementation of an intervention for these youth? Methods: Through systematic searches of academic databases for articles and reports published between 2008 and 2018{\textemdash}as well as identifying unpublished concurrent studies through professional outreach, hand-searching reference lists, and searches of websites{\textemdash}we screened 1602 studies through two levels of blind review. We then inductively coded the resulting 47 studies that met our inclusion criteria to identify patterns and gaps in the existing literature about implementation and engagement in these programs. Results: Most of the studies analyzed took place in urban settings, were based on programs located in the United States, and included a variety of interventions from behavioral health treatment to street outreach and case management. The 47 eligible studies included 3112 youth and 495 staff participants. Only 3 out of the 47 studies explicitly focused on racial or LGBTQ equity. Two primary themes regarding factors that support successful implementation and engagement were identified: (1) Organizational and system-wide policies can shape the quality and duration of interventions, and (2) Staff behaviors and training are paramount to the success of many interventions. With respect to organizational and system-wide policies, many studies highlighted the importance of fostering a developmentally appropriate balance between structure and flexibility; considerations to access including low-barrier options when appropriate; concerns regarding the physical space of the program; and coordination with other agencies, particularly for effective referrals. With respect to staffing behaviors and training, studies highlighted that engagement with youth experiencing homelessness requires strong commu\- nication, a youth-centered approach, and a ``flexible, non-judgmental orientation,'' that allows youth a sub\- stantial level of self-determination. Conclusions: Given these findings, this review supports services that emphasize empowerment and antipaternalism, and increased attention to racial and LGBTQ equity in future exploration of implementation and engagement within programs designed for youth experiencing homelessness.},

RHY have multiple, overlapping problems often including poor physical and mental health, frequent street victimization, and histories of physical and sexual abuse. Further, current street victimization interacts with childhood abuse to produce complex, unique presentations of traumatic symptoms and related disorders in runaway and homeless youth. This review paper explores (1) the role of childhood trauma in the genesis of runaway and homeless behavior, and (2) how childhood trauma interacts with street victimization to create vulnerability to psychopathology. In response to the trauma needs of RHY, we conducted a systematic review of the state of the current literature on trauma-informed interventions for RHY. We conclude that the field currently lacks empirically validated trauma interventions in RHY. However, theoretically plausible frameworks do exist and could be the basis for future research and intervention development.},

Data were collected from 6,177 adolescents and 1,805 adults as part of 77 studies in three dozen locations around the United States that used the GAIN. For both adolescents and adults the 20-item total disorder screener (TDScr) and its four 5-item sub-screeners (internalizing disorders, externalizing disorders, substance disorders, and crime/violence) has good internal consistency (alpha of .96 on total screener), is highly correlated (r = .84 to .94) with the 123-item longer scales in the full GAIN. The GSS also does well in terms of its receiver operator characteristics (90\% or more under the curve in all analyses) and has clinical decision-making cut points with excellent sensitivity (90\% or more) for identifying people with a disorder and excellent specificity (92\% or more) for correctly ruling out people who did not have a disorder. The GSS has good potential as an efficient screener for identifying people with co-occurring disorders across multiple systems and routing them to the right services and more detailed assessments.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To systematically analyze the self-reported reasons why children and youth around the world become street-involved and to analyze the available data by level of human development, geographic region, and sex. DATA SOURCES Electronic searches of Scopus, PsychINFO, EMBASE, POPLINE, PubMed, ERIC, and the Social Sciences Citation Index were conducted from January 1, 1990, to the third week of July 2013. We searched the peer-reviewed literature for studies that reported quantitative reasons for street involvement. The following broad search strategy was used to search the databases: ``street children'' OR ``street youth'' OR ``homeless youth'' OR ``homeless children'' OR ``runaway children'' OR ``runaway youth'' or ``homeless persons.'' STUDY SELECTION Studies were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) participants were 24 years of age or younger, (2) participants met our definition of street-connected children and youth, and (3) the quantitative reasons for street involvement were reported. We reviewed 318 full texts and identified 49 eligible studies. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers. We fit logistic mixed-effects models to estimate the pooled prevalence of each reason and to estimate subgroup pooled prevalence by development level or geographic region. The meta-analysis was conducted from February to August 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We created the following categories based on the reported reasons in the literature: poverty, abuse, family conflict, delinquency, psychosocial health, and other. RESULTS In total, there were 13 559 participants from 24 countries, of which 21 represented developing countries. The most commonly reported reason for street involvement was poverty, with a pooled-prevalence estimate of 39\% (95\% CI, 29\%-51\%). Forty-seven studies included in this review reported family conflict as the reason for street involvement, with a pooled prevalence of 32\% (95\% CI, 26\%-39\%). Abuse was equally reported in developing and developed countries as the reason for street involvement, with a pooled prevalence of 26\% (95\% CI, 18\%-35\%). Delinquency was the least frequently cited reason overall, with a pooled prevalence of 10\% (95\% CI, 5\%-20\%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The street-connected children and youth who provided reasons for their street involvement infrequently identified delinquent behaviors for their circumstances and highlighted the role of poverty as a driving factor. They require support and protection, and governments globally are called on to reduce the socioeconomic inequities that cause children and youth to turn to the streets in the first place, in all regions of the world.},

  abstract = {Background Emerging evidence at the international level suggests that the Housing First approach could improve the housing stability of young people experiencing homelessness. However, there is a dearth of literature in Canada on whether the Housing First intervention for young people experiencing homelessness can improve outcomes including housing stability, health and well-being, and access to complementary supports. Adapted from the original Housing First model, Housing First for Youth (HF4Y) was developed in Canada as a rights-based approach tailored specifically for young people aged 16 to 24 years who are experiencing or are at risk of homelessness. Objective The Making the Shift Youth Homelessness Social Innovation Lab is testing the effectiveness of the HF4Y intervention in Canada. The objective of this study is to determine whether the HF4Y model results in better participant-level outcomes than treatment-as-usual services for young people experiencing homelessness in 2 urban settings: Ottawa and Toronto, Ontario. Primary outcomes include housing stability, health and well-being, and complementary supports, and secondary outcomes include employment and educational attainment and social inclusion. Methods The HF4Y study used a multisite, mixed methods, randomized controlled trial research approach for data collection and analysis. Eligible participants included young people aged 16 to 24 years who were experiencing homelessness or housing precarity. The participants were randomly assigned to either the treatment-as-usual group or the housing first intervention group. Survey and interview data in Ottawa and Toronto, Ontario are being collected at multiple time points (3-6 months) over 4 years to capture a range of outcomes. Analytic strategies for quantitative data will include mixed-effects modeling for repeated measures and logistic models. A thematic analysis will be used to analyze qualitative data based on participants' narratives and life journeys through homelessness. Furthermore, program fidelity evaluations are conducted within each HF4Y program. These evaluations assess how well the intervention aligns with the HF4Y model and identify any areas that may require adjustments or additional support. Results The HF4Y study has received human participant research ethics approval from the Office of Research Ethics at York University. Recruitment was conducted between February 2018 and March 2020. Data collection is expected to be completed at both sites by March 2024. A preliminary analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data collected between baseline and 24 months is underway. Conclusions This pilot randomized controlled trial is the first to test the effectiveness of the HF4Y intervention in Canada. The findings of this study will enhance our understanding of how to effectively deliver and scale up the HF4Y intervention, with the aim of continually improving the HF4Y model to promote better outcomes for youth.

The standard services (S group, n = 174) participants remained eligible for standard services. Access to the Australian Government income support agency's (Centrelink) administrative data provided a retention rate close to 90\% over the three annual data collection points of the study (baseline, 12 months and 24 months). Both groups improved their circumstances over the two years of the trial. The results showed no statistically significant treatment effects. The effect for employment earnings was approaching significance (p = .06) with J group increasing their employment earnings to a greater extent than S group. The findings and their implications for the implementation of joined up case management, future policy and practice, and future homelessness research is discussed.},

This systematic review collates, summarizes, and appraises published studies of youth investigating relationships between homelessness, perpetration of sexual offenses, experience of sexual victimization, and engagement in sexual risk behavior. A systematic search of seventeen psychology, health, and social science electronic databases was conducted. Search terms included``homeless*,'' ``youth,''``offend*,''``victimization,''``crime,''``rape,''``victim*,'' and``sex crimes.''Thirty-eight studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Findings showed homeless youth commonly report being raped and sexually assaulted, fear being sexually victimized, and engage in street prostitution and survival sex. Rates of victimization and sexual risk behavior were generally higher for females. Given the paucity of longitudinal studies and limitations of current studies, it is unclear whether homelessness is prospectively associated with sexual victimization or engagement in sexual risk behavior, and whether such associations vary cross nationally and as a function of time and place. Future prospective research examining the influence of the situational context of homelessness is necessary to develop a better understanding of how homelessness influences the perpetration of sexual offenses, experience of sexual victimization, and engagement in sexual risk behavior among homeless youth.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Given the lack of evidence for interventions targeting housing outcomes in transitional-age homeless youth (ages 18{\textendash}24 years), we aimed to test the effect of Housing First on housing stability among a group of homeless youth with mental illness enrolled in At Home/Chez Soi, a \$110 million 24month randomized controlled trial of Housing First in five Canadian cities. Methods: Homeless individuals with mental illness were randomized to receive Housing First, a scattered-site choice-based housing intervention (without preconditions of sobriety or psychiatric treatment) and mental health services according to the level of need (assertive community treatment or intensive case management), or usual care. Participants completed interviews every 6 months and measures of housing status every 3 months to a total of 24 months. We assessed housing stability as percent days stably housed as a proportion of days for which residence data were available in youth aged 18{\textendash}24 years, fit a model with a three-way interaction of treatment group (age 18{\textendash}24 years vs. {$>$}24 years), and compared the effect on housing stability in youth versus adults. We used a repeated measures mixed-effects model to estimate differences/ratios from baseline over 24 months for secondary health and service use outcomes. Results: Of the 2,148 total participants who were randomized, 156 were youth aged 18{\textendash}24 years: 87 received Housing First and 69 received usual care. In an adjusted analysis, youth in Housing First were stably housed a mean of 437/645 (65 percent) days for which data were available compared with youth in usual care, who were stably housed a mean of 189/582 (31 percent) days, resulting in an adjusted mean difference of 34 percent (95\% CI 24{\textendash}45, P {$<$} 0.0001). The effect of the three-way interaction of treatment group, age, and time on housing stability was nonsignificant (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.5934). Youth who received Housing First were less likely to have a period of employment (adjusted OR {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.48, 95\% CI 0.24{\textendash}0.99, P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.0456), but otherwise, their secondary outcomes were not significantly different from youth who received usual care. Conclusions: Housing First led to improved housing stability in homeless youth with mental illness and appears to be no less effective in youth than in older adults. More research is needed to guide adaptations of the model to further improve housing stability and other outcomes in youth.},

This study examined the unique demographic, clinical, and service use characteristics of homeless youths. Methods: At Home/Chez Soi was a large randomized controlled trial of the Housing First model in five cities in Canada. Of 2,255 participants, 7\% (N=164) were youths ages 18 to 24. Youths were compared with older participants on baseline demographic, clinical, and service use characteristics. Results: More youths than adults had not finished high school (76\% versus 54\%), had a drug use disorder (66\% versus 52\%), and had been assaulted in the past six months (44\% versus 36\%) (all p{$<$}.05). Fewer than half the youths (49\%) had a regular medical doctor, 50\% reported unmet need for health care, and 61\% visited an emergency department in the past six months. Conclusions: This sample of homeless youths with mental illness had low education, high rates of substance use disorders and victimization, and problems accessing services. These findings suggest that youths have trajectories to homelessness and service needs that are distinct from adults and may guide future planning for this vulnerable population.},

We aimed to evaluate the effect of "Housing First" on housing stability in homeless youth aged 18 to 24 years participating in At Home/Chez Soi, a 24-month randomized trial of "Housing First" in 5 Canadian cities. METHODS: Homeless individuals with mental illness were randomized to receive "Housing First" (combined with assertive community treatment or intensive case management depending on their level of need) or treatment as usual. We defined our primary outcome, housing stability, as the percent of days stably housed as a proportion of days for which residence data were available. RESULTS: Of 2148 participants who completed baseline interviews and were randomized, 7\% (n = 156) were youth aged 18 to 24 years; 87 received "Housing First" and 69 received treatment as usual. In an adjusted analysis, youth in "Housing First" were stably housed a mean of 437 of 645 (65\%) days for which data were available compared with youth in treatment as usual, who were stably housed a mean of 189 of 582 (31\%) days for which data were available, resulting in an adjusted mean difference of 34\% (95\% confidence interval, 24\%{\textendash}45\%; P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSIONS: "Housing First" was associated with improved housing stability in homeless youth with mental illness.

  abstract = {BackgroundStudies conducted in the USA have found the individual placement and support model of supported employment to be more effective than traditional vocational rehabilitation at helping people with severe mental illness to find and maintain competitive employment.AimsTo determine the effectiveness of the individual placement and support (supported employment) model in a Canadian setting.MethodA total of 150 adults with severe mental illness, who were not currently employed and who desired competitive employment, were randomly assigned to receive either supported employment (n=75) or traditional vocational services (n=75).ResultsOver the 12 months of follow-up, 47\% of clients in the supported employment group obtained at least some competitive employment, v. 18\% of the control group (P{$<$}0.001). They averaged 126 h of competitive work, v. 72 inthe control group (P{$<$}0.001).ConclusionsSupported employment proved more effective than traditional vocational services in a setting significantly different from settings in the USA, and may therefore be generalised to settings in other countries.},

  abstract = {Objective: Housing First (HF) programs for people who are chronically or episodically homeless, combining rapid access to permanent housing with community-based, integrated treatment, rehabilitation and support services, are rapidly expanding in North America and Europe. Overall costs of services use by homeless people can be considerable, suggesting the potential for significant cost offsets with HF programs. Our purpose was to provide an updated literature review, from 2007 to the present, focusing specifically on the cost offsets of HF programs. Method: A systematic review was performed on MEDLINE and PsycINFO as well as Google and the Homeless Hub for grey literature. Study characteristics and key findings were extracted from identified studies. Where available, impact on service cost associated with HF (increase or decrease) and net impact on overall costs, taking into account the cost of HF intervention, were noted. Results: Twelve published studies (4 randomized studies and 8 quasi-experimental) and 22 unpublished studies were retained. Shelter and emergency department costs decreased with HF, while impacts on hospitalization and justice costs are more ambiguous. Studies using a pre{\textendash}post design reported a net decrease in overall costs with HF. In contrast, experimental studies reported a net increase in overall costs with HF. Conclusions: While our review casts doubt on whether HF programs can be expected to pay for themselves, the certainty of significant cost offsets, combined with their benefits for participants, means that they represent a more efficient allocation of resources than traditional services.},

  abstract = {Sexual minority (SM) youth have twice the risk of experiencing homelessness compared to their heterosexual peers. Further, SM youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) report greater depression symptoms and substance use compared to heterosexual YEH. Housing First is an intervention that provides scattered-site individual apartments, without any prerequisite conditions for eligibility, and additional services to support long-term housing sustainment; however, few studies have examined the effectiveness of this approach for SM youth. The current study utilized data from a RCT that provided housing to young mothers experiencing homelessness to examine if treatment effects varied by mothers' sexual identity. Mothers were randomly assigned to services as usual (i.e., provided a referral sheet of all services available in the community; SAU), Housing only (i.e., three months of utility and rental assistance; Housing), or housing and supportive services (integrates independent housing, Strengths-Based Outreach and Advocacy (SBOA), HIV prevention, and substance use/mental health counseling; Housing + SS). Latent growth curve models were estimated to assess how substance use and depression symptoms changed over the 12 months. SM mothers receiving SAU or Housing did not experience a significant change in substance use or depression symptoms. All groups of heterosexual mothers and SM mothers receiving Housing + SS had less substance use and depression symptoms at twelve months, with SM mothers in Housing + SS evidencing a steeper decline in substance use and depression symptoms. This study provides some of the first evidence that Housing First can mitigate the mental health and substance use concerns of SM YEH. Given SM's higher rates of homelessness, substance use, and depression symptoms, Housing First should be further explored as an intervention to address their unique needs.},

  abstract = {Background: LGBTQ+ youth face many health and societal challenges including issues related to homelessness. Design: A systematic review of qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies. Methods: A search of relevant electronic databases was carried out and included the dates August 2008{\textendash}August 2018 and limited to academic journals and peer-reviewed empirical studies written in English. Included studies specifically addressed the homeless experiences of youth aged 13{\textendash}24 years old who identified as LGBTQ+. The PRISMA checklist was used in the review. A quality assessment instrument was used to review all of the selected papers and narrative methods utilised in the synthesis of the research evidence. Results: The search resulted in 319 papers, and after applying distinct inclusion criteria, a total of 14 papers were considered suitable for the systematic review. Following analysis, the four main themes identified were stigma, discrimination and exclusion; mental health issues and substance use; sexual risks and vulnerability; and interventions and supports. Conclusion: LGBTQ+ homeless youth is a major public health concern that has significant consequences for a young person's physical and psychosocial well-being. Relevance to clinical practice: Practitioners need to be aware of the specific health and support requirements of LGBTQ+ youth in relation to homelessness. Inclusive and holistic care plans should exist that are fully responsive to the distinct needs of this group guided by definitive policies and sound clinical research. The implications for future nursing practice are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {This Campbell systematic review examines the effectiveness of interventions to reduce homelessness and increase residential stability for individuals who are homeless, or at risk of becoming homeless. Forty-three studies were included in the review, 37 of which are from the USA. Included interventions perform better than the usual services at reducing homelessness or improving housing stability in all comparisons. These interventions are: High intensity case management Housing First Critical time intervention Abstinence-contingent housing Non-abstinence-contingent housing with high intensity case management Housing vouchers Residential treatment These interventions seem to have similar beneficial effects, so it is unclear which of these is best with respect to reducing homelessness and increasing housing stability. Plain Language Summary Interventions to reduce homelessness and improve housing stability are effective There are large numbers of homeless people around the world. Interventions to address homelessness seem to be effective, though better quality evidence is required. What is this review about? There are large numbers of homeless people around the world. Recent estimates are over 500,000 people in the USA, 100,000 in Australia and 30,000 in Sweden. Efforts to combat homelessness have been made on national levels as well as at local government levels. This review assesses the effectiveness of interventions combining housing and case management as a means to reduce homelessness and increase residential stability for individuals who are homeless, or at risk of becoming homeless. What is the aim of this review? This Campbell systematic review examines the effectiveness of interventions to reduce homelessness and increase residential stability for individuals who are homeless, or at risk of becoming homeless. Forty-three studies were included in the review, 37 of which are from the USA. What studies are included? Included studies were randomized controlled trials of interventions for individuals who were already, or at-risk of becoming, homeless, and which measured impact on homelessness or housing stability with follow-up of at least one year. A total of 43 studies were included. The majority of the studies (37) were conducted in the United States, with three from the United Kingdom and one each from Australia, Canada, and Denmark. What are the main findings of this review? Included interventions perform better than the usual services at reducing homelessness or improving housing stability in all comparisons. These interventions are: High intensity case management Housing First Critical time intervention Abstinence-contingent housing Non-abstinence-contingent housing with high intensity case management Housing vouchers Residential treatment These interventions seem to have similar beneficial effects, so it is unclear which of these is best with respect to reducing homelessness and increasing housing stability. What do the findings of this review mean? A range of housing programs and case management interventions appear to reduce homelessness and improve housing stability, compared to usual services. However, there is uncertainty in this finding as most the studies have risk of bias due to poor reporting, lack of blinding, or poor randomization or allocation concealment of participants. In addition to the general need for better conducted and reported studies, there are specific gaps in the research with respect to: 1) disadvantaged youth; 2) abstinence-contingent housing with case management or day treatment; 3) non-abstinence contingent housing comparing group vs independent living; 4) Housing First compared to interventions other than usual services, and; 5) studies outside of the USA. How up-to-date is this review? The review authors searched for studies published up to January 2016. This Campbell systematic review was published in February 2018. Executive summary Background The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 25) states that everyone has a right to housing. However, this right is far from being realized for many people worldwide. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are approximately 100 million homeless people worldwide. The aim of this report is to contribute evidence to inform future decision making and practice for preventing and reducing homelessness. Objectives To identify, appraise and summarize the evidence on the effectiveness of housing programs and case management to improve housing stability and reduce homelessness among people who are homeless or at-risk of becoming homeless. Search methods We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the Norwegian Knowledge Centre's handbook. We systematically searched for literature in relevant databases and conducted a grey literature search which was last updated in January 2016. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials that included individuals who were already, or at-risk of becoming, homeless were included if they examined the effectiveness of relevant interventions on homelessness or housing stability. There were no limitations regarding language, country or length of homelessness. Two reviewers screened 2,918 abstracts and titles for inclusion. They read potentially relevant references in full, and included relevant studies in the review. Data collection and analysis We pooled the results and conducted meta-analyses when possible. Our certainty in the primary outcomes was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation for effectiveness approach (GRADE). Results We included 43 relevant studies (described in 78 publications) that examined the effectiveness of housing programs and/or case management services on homelessness and/or housing stability. The results are summarized below. Briefly, we found that the included interventions performed better than the usual services in all comparisons. However, certainty in the findings varied from very low to moderate. Most of the studies were assessed as having high risk of bias due to poor reporting, lack of blinding, or poor randomization and/or allocation concealment of participants. Case management Case management is a process where clients are assigned case managers who assess, plan and facilitate access to health and social services necessary for the client's recovery. The intensity of these services can vary. One specific model is Critical time intervention, which is based on the same principles, but offered in three three-month periods that decrease in intensity. High intensity case management compared to usual services has generally more positive effects: It probably reduces the number of individuals who are homeless after 12-18 months by almost half (RR=0.59, 95\%CI=0.41 to 0.87)(moderate certainty evidence); It may increase the number of people living in stable housing after 12-18 months and reduce the number of days an individual spends homeless (low certainty evidence), however; it may have no effect on the number of individuals who experience some homelessness during a two year period (low certainty evidence). When compared to low intensity case management, it may have little or no effect on time spent in stable housing (low certainty evidence). Critical time intervention compared to usual services may 1) have no effect on the number of people who experience homelessness, 2) lead to fewer days spent homeless, 3) lead to more days spent not homeless and, 4) reduce the amount of time it takes to move from shelter to independent housing (low certainty evidence). Abstinence-contingent housing programs Abstinence-contingent housing is housing provided with the expectation that residents will remain sober. The results showed that abstinence-contingent housing may lead to fewer days spent homeless, compared with usual services (low certainty evidence). Non-abstinence-contingent housing programs Non-abstinence-contingent housing is housing provided with no expectations regarding sobriety of residents. Housing First is the name of one specific non-abstinence-contingent housing program. When compared to usual services Housing First probably reduces the number of days spent homeless (MD=-62.5, 95\%CI=-86.86 to -38.14) and increases the number of days in stable housing (MD=110.1, 95\%CI=93.05 to 127.15) (moderate certainty evidence). In addition, it may increase the number of people placed in permanent housing after 20 months (low certainty evidence). Non-abstinence-contingent housing programs (not specified as Housing First) in combination with high intensity case management may reduce homelessness, compared to usual services (low certainty evidence). Group living arrangements may be better than individual apartments at reducing homelessness (low certainty evidence). Housing vouchers with case management Housing vouchers is a housing allowance given to certain groups of people who qualify. The results showed that it mayreduce homelessness and improve housing stability, compared with usual services or case management (low certainty evidence). Residential treatment with case management Residential treatment is a type of housing offered to clients who also need treatment for mental illness or substance abuse. We found that it mayreduce homelessness and improve housing stability, compared with usual services (low certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions We found that a range of housing programs and case management interventions appear to reduce homelessness and improve housing stability, compared to usual services. The findings showed no indication of housing programs or case management resulting in poorer outcomes for homeless or at-risk individuals than usual services. Aside from a general need for better conducted and reported studies, there are specific gaps in the research. We identified research gaps concerning: 1)Disadvantaged youth; 2) Abstinence-contingent housing with case management or day treatment; 3) Non-abstinence contingent housing, specifically different living arrangements (group vs independent living); 4) Housing First compared to interventions other than usual services, and; 5) All interventions from contexts other than the USA.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the development and evaluation of a brief, multidimensional, selfadministered, social support survey that was developed for patients in the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS), a two-year study of patients with chronic conditions. This survey was designed to be comprehensive in terms of recent thinking about the various dimensions of social support. In addition, it was designed to be distinct from other related measures. We present a summary of the major conceptual issues considered when choosing items for the social support battery, describe the items, and present findings based on data from 2987 patients (ages 18 and older). Multitrait scaling analyses supported the dimensionality of four functional support scales (emotional/informational, tangible, affectionate, and positive social interaction) and the construction of an overall functional social support index. These support measures are distinct from structural measures of social support and from related health measures. They are reliable (all Alphas {$>$}0.91), and are fairly stable over time. Selected construct validity hypotheses were supported.},

Using data from the WHOQOL-BREF field trials, the objectives of this work are to examine the performance of the WHOQOL-BREF as an integrated instrument, and to test its main psychometric properties. The WHOQOL-BREF is a 26-item version of the WHOQOL-100 assessment. Its psychometric properties were analysed using cross-sectional data obtained from a survey of adults carried out in 23 countries (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 11,830). Sick and well respondents were sampled from the general population, as well as from hospital, rehabilitation and primary care settings, serving patients with physical and mental disorders and with respect to quotas of important socio-demographic variables. The WHOQOL-BREF self-assessment was completed, together with socio-demographic and health status questions. Analyses of internal consistency, item{\textendash}total correlations, discriminant validity and construct validity through confirmatory factor analysis, indicate that the WHOQOL-BREF has good to excellent psychometric properties of reliability and performs well in preliminary tests of validity. These results indicate that overall, the WHOQOL-BREF is a sound, cross-culturally valid assessment of QOL, as reflected by its four domains: physical, psychological, social and environment.},

  abstract = {Background: Housing First has become a popular treatment model for homeless adults with mental illness, yet little is known about program participants' early experiences or trajectories. This study used a mixed methods design to examine participant changes in selected domains 6 months after enrolment in a Canadian field trial of Housing First. Methods: The study sample included 301 participants receiving the Housing First intervention at the Toronto site of the At Home/Chez Soi project. This study used a pre-post design to compare quantitative 6-month outcome data to baseline values in key domains and multivariate regression to identify baseline demographic, clinical or service use variables associated with observed changes in these domains. In addition, qualitative data exploring participant and service provider perspectives and experiences was collected via stakeholder interviews and focus groups, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: The majority (60 to 72\%) of participants followed the expected trajectory of improvement, with the remaining experiencing difficulties in community integration, mental health symptom severity, substance use, community functioning and quality of life 6 months after program enrolment. Diagnosis of psychotic disorder was associated with a reduction in quality of life from baseline to 6-months, while substance use disorders were associated with reduced mental illness symptoms and substance use related problems and an improvement in quality of life. Participants housed in independent housing at 6-months had greater improvements in community integration and quality of life, and greater reduction in mental illness symptoms, compared to those not independently housed. The quality of the working alliance was positively associated with improvements in physical and psychological community integration and quality of life. Qualitative data provided a unique window into the loneliness and isolation experienced by Housing First participants, as well as problems related to substance use and a need for life skills training and support. Conclusions: Additional strategies can help support Housing First participants in the early stages of program participation and address potential causes of early difficulties, including lack of life skills and social isolation. This study highlights the importance of early and ongoing evaluation, monitoring and program adaptations to address consumer support needs.

  abstract = {Homeless youth are an understudied and stigmatized group. In their daily lives, these youth confront negative social perceptions and harrowing circumstances related to survival, which may present challenges to the construction of a meaningful, coherent identity. Using the theoretical notion of narrative engagement (Hammack \& Cohler, 2009), this study explores how youth experiencing homelessness make meaning of their lived experiences and engage with dominant discourses about homelessness that stigmatize and devalue them. A narrative analysis of 4 case studies, drawn from in-depth life story interviews with 11 unhoused youth in the United States, suggests that despite experience of struggle and loss, participants demonstrated the ability to (a) resist contamination through the construction of redemptive narratives, grounded in agency and resilience; and (b) resist dominant narratives about homelessness by attributing their circumstances to external causes and by critiquing institutions and figures perceived as holding power. In doing so, participants refused to adopt a ``criminal'' or ``client'' master narrative of homeless identity, instead affirming the value and worth of their knowledge, experiences, and identities. This study reveals the active agency of homeless youth to construct counternarratives in which they may restory their identities to find resilience in the margins.},

  abstract = {Background: Youth often experience unique pathways into homelessness, such as family conflict, child abuse and neglect. Most research has focused on adult homeless populations, yet youth have specific needs that require adapted interventions. This review aims to synthesize evidence on interventions for youth and assess their impacts on health, social, and equity outcomes. Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and other databases from inception until February 9, 2018 for systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials on youth interventions conducted in high income countries. We screened title and abstract and full text for inclusion, and data extraction were completed in duplicate, following the PRISMA-E (equity) review approach. Results: Our search identified 11,936 records. Four systematic reviews and 18 articles on randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Many studies reported on interventions including individual and family therapies, skill-building, case management, and structural interventions. Cognitive behavioural therapy led to improvements in depression and substance use, and studies of three family-based therapies reported decreases in substance use. Housing first, a structural intervention, led to improvements in housing stability. Many interventions showed inconsistent results compared to services as usual or other interventions, but often led to improvements over time in both the intervention and comparison group. The equity analysis showed that equity variables were inconsistently measured, but there was data to suggest differential outcomes based upon gender and ethnicity. Conclusions: This review identified a variety of interventions for youth experiencing homelessness. Promising interventions include cognitive behavioural therapy for addressing depression, family-based therapy for substance use outcomes, and housing programs for housing stability. Youth pathways are often unique and thus prevention and treatment may benefit from a tailored and flexible approach.},

Scoring algorithms from the general population used to score 12-item versions of the two components (Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary) achieved R squares of 0.905 with the SF-36 Physical Component Summary and 0.938 with the SF-36 Mental Component Summary when cross-validated in the Medical Outcomes Study. Test-retest (2-week) correlations of 0.89 and 0.76 were observed for the 12-item Physical Component Summary and the 12-item Mental Component Summary, respectively, in the general US population (n = 232). Twenty cross-sectional and longitudinal tests of empirical validity previously published for the 36-item short-form scales and summary measures were replicated for the 12-item Physical Component Summary and the 12-item Mental Component Summary, including comparisons between patient groups known to differ or to change in terms of the presence and seriousness of physical and mental conditions, acute symptoms, age and aging, self-reported 1-year changes in health, and recovery from depression. In 14 validity tests involving physical criteria, relative validity estimates for the 12-item Physical Component Summary ranged from 0.43 to 0.93 (median = 0.67) in comparison with the best 36-item short-form scale. Relative validity estimates for the 12-item Mental Component Summary in 6 tests involving mental criteria ranged from 0.60 to 1.07 (median = 0.97) in relation to the best 36-item short-form scale. Average scores for the 2 summary measures, and those for most scales in the 8-scale profile based on the 12-item short-form, closely mirrored those for the 36-item short-form, although standard errors were nearly always larger for the 12-item short-form.},

  abstract = {Emerging adulthood, viewed through the lens of life course health development, has the potential to be a very positive developmental stage with postindustrial societies giving adolescents and emerging adults a greater opportunity for choice and exploration but also greater challenges with greater educational and social role requirements. The loss of supports and structures offered by schools, families, and child- and family-oriented health and social services means that the emerging adult must rely more on his/her own resources in a less structured environment. This increased agency in the context of less structure is occurring as the human brain is still developing higher-level capacities such as executive functioning. The person-context interactions during EA are many and complex, leading to multiple different pathways through emerging adulthood. Those with sufficient economic and adult supports as well as personal resources and maturity will be more likely to choose well and embark on a positive trajectory during EA. Those lacking these resources, or those with physical and mental health or intellectual disabilities, may struggle during this period and experience a negative trajectory in the spheres of education, vocation, relationships, and health status. The life course health science of EA requires more detailed and deeper analysis of the relationship between family, peers, and societal supports and personal internal resources in order to help promote successful developmental trajectories during~EA.},

  abstract = {Housing First (HF) models have gained popularity among many politicians, policy-makers, and social service providers. Proponents of this model argue for its strength by drawing on research evidence. In other words, the use of HF is deemed an `evidence-based practice.' Despite this, a strong synthesis of the evidence used to champion these models is lacking. This article seeks to address this gap, with a review focused on outcomes associated with participation in HF programs. Specifically, we investigate the details of program design coupled with specific outcomes, so as to better inform future action and research. We conclude that the research forming the evidence base for HF is methodologically strong. However, additional research is needed to determine the benefits of HF for diverse populations. Additional research is also required to conclusively determine the impact of HF on substance use and psychiatric treatment.
