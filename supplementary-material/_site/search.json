Primary outcome domains were stable housing, health, social and emotional wellbeing, education, employment and earnings. Secondary outcomes domains were legal and justice, independent living skills, and social connections.\nBoth randomised and non-randomised study designs that used causal methods to assess the impact of the intervention were eligible for inclusion. Specifically, a non-randomised study needed to use a counterfactual approach that estimated the impact of the intervention by comparing observed participant outcomes with hypothetical non-participant outcomes.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria by used in this review by PICOSS domain are detailed in Table 2.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Inclusion and exclusion criteria by PICOSS domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain\nInclusion criteria\nExclusion criteria\n\n\n\n\nPopulation\nYouth aged 16-25 who:\n\nAre currently, or have previously, experienced homelessness; and\nHave substantial socio-emotional issues that require services beyond housing, such as:\n\nHave current or prior mental health issues (either self-reported or diagnosed)\nPrior involvement with child protection or out-of-home care system\nHave prior involvement with the juvenile or adult justice system\nHave a history of family violence, as victims or perpretrators\nHave current or prior problem use of alcohol and other drugs (either self-reported or diagnosed)\nHave a physical or intellectual disability\nReceived public assistance payments; and/or\n\nAre a member of a demographic group known to be facing additional barriers, including:\n\nAdolescent parents\nIdentify as First Nations\nIdentify as LGBTIQ+\n\n\nStudies where more than 80% of the population do not meet inclusion criteria e.g., individuals aged under 16 or over 25.\n\n\nIntervention\nInterventions that combine the provision of accommodation — either directly or indirectly — with additional support services such as:\n\nCase management\nCounselling, mental health or psychological assistance\nIndependent living or life skills development\nTransportation assistance\nEmployment skills training and/or coaching\nSupport to engage or re-engage in education\nResidential advisors\nPersonalised advice or mentoring\n\nStudies examining other interventions\n\n\nComparison\nTreatment as usual, another intervention, no intervention, or waitlist control\nStudies using other comparators\n\n\nOutcome\nStudies that report outcomes within the following domains:\n\nStable housing\nHealth\nSocial and Emotional Wellbeing\nEducation\nEmployment and Earnings\nLegal and Justice\nIndependent living skills\nSocial connections\n\nStudies that report other outcomes\n\n\nSetting\nHigh income countries as defined by the World Bank in FY2022-23\nCountries defined as low and middle income by the World Bank in FY2022-23\n\n\nStudy design\nRandomised controlled trials (RCT) including:\n\nIndividual RCTs\nCluster RCTs\n\nStep-Wedge designs with random time allocation\nNon-randomised designs that use parallel cohorts that adjust for baseline equivalence:\n\nCovariate matching\nPropensity score based methods\nDoubly robust methods\nInstrumental variable estimation\nDifference-in-Difference estimation\nInterrupted time-series\nRegression discontinuity designs\nSynthetic control studies\n\nNon-primary studies, including:\n\nLiterature reviews\nSystematic reviews\nMeta-analysis\n\nStudies without a valid counterfactual, including:\n\nSingle group pre-post designs\nControl group designs without matching in time and establishing baseline equivalence\nCross-sectional designs\nNon-controlled observational (cohort) designs\nCase-control designs\nCase studies/series\nSurveys"

    "text": "3.2 Search methods\nOur search strategy encompassed 10 electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Trials via Ovid, CINAHL via EBSCO, EMBASE via Ovid, ERIC via ProQuest, PsycINFO via Ovid, MEDLINE via Ovid, Sociological Abstracts via ProQuest, Social Services Abstracts via ProQuest, Criminal Justice Abstracts via EBSCO, Violence and Abuse Abstracts via EBSCO) with no year of publication or language restrictions. Our strategy for identifying grey literature comprised searching six clearinghouses, government agencies and organisations known to be undertaking or consolidating research in this area (Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute (AHURI), Analysis and Policy Observatory database (APO), Australian Criminology Database (CINCH), Australian Family and Society Abstracts database (AIFS), Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago and the Washington State for Public Policy). Reference lists of included studies were reviewed as were studies included in reviews by Altena, Brilleslijper-Kater, & Wolf (2010), Wang et al. (2019) and Morton, Kugley, Epstein, & Farrell (2020).\nBarriers and facilitators to implementation are not typically reported at length in the results of published RCTs or NRSs. We expanded our search to review additional reports of included studies in order to identify them. These included: study protocols, conference presentations, technical reports and process/implementation evaluations.\nAdditional reports of the same study were identified by a) reviewing reference lists of included studies, b) reviewing the RCT registry records of included studies, c) reviewing additional publications by the authors of included studies.\n\n3.2.1 Search strategy and results for database\nThe databases and search terms are detailed in Table 3 below.\n\n\n\nTable 3: Search terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase\nSearch terms\nDate searched\nRecord #\n\n\n\n\nCochrane CENTRAL Registed of Controlled Trials via Ovid\n1. exp Homeless Youth/ or exp Homeless Persons/ or Homeless*.mp or Couchsurf*.mp or (Unstab* adj2 hous*).mp or Runaway.mp or Rough sleep*.mp or Insecur* hous*.mp\n2. exp Young Adult/ or exp Adolescent/ or (Emerging adj2 (Adult or Youth)).mp or adolescent.mp or Youth.mp or (young adj1 (adult or person or people)).mp\n3. 1 AND 2\n4. exp Randomized Controlled Trial/ or exp Clinical Trial/ or exp Controlled Clinical Trial/ or exp Comparative Study/\n5.

    "text": "3.5 Effect size transformation\nIn most cases, formulas from Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein (2009) were used to convert reported results into a common effect size (Hedges’ g). This was done using the R Project for Statistical Computing (R Core Team, 2024), and specifically the esc package (Lüdecke, 2019).\nIn cases where studies lacked sufficient data for effect size computation or conversion, the study’s authors were approached to obtain the missing information. If this information was unavailable or insufficient to calculate an effect size, reasonable assumptions were made.\nThe results in the study by Kozloff, Adair, et al. (2016) are one such case where assumptions were made. Results in this study were presented as treatment effects (i.e., mean differences, ratios or rate ratios and ratios of odds ratios and their confidence intervals). The review team was unable to obtain the necessary information from the authors to transform these using the formulas in the esc package. Accordingly we approximated these results using information reported in the included studies. The approach used for each type of result, and the assumptions they rely on are detailed below.\n\n3.5.1 Estimating Cohen’s d or Hedges’ g from a Ratio of Rate Ratios\nThe esc_ratio_rate_ratio function estimates Cohen’s d or Hedges’ g effect sizes from a reported ratio of rate ratios, its standard error or confidence interval, sample sizes, and the population baseline rate. The method relies on several assumptions and approximations to convert the ratio of rate ratios to a standardised mean difference.\n\n3.5.1.1 Assumptions\n\nThe ratio of rate ratios is a measure of the relative difference in event rates between the treatment and comparison groups, with the comparison group as the reference (Lash, VanderWeele, Haneause, & Rothman, 2021).\nThe standard error of the ratio of rate ratios is either provided or can be calculated from the confidence interval assuming a normal distribution (Altman & Bland, 2011).\nThe population baseline rate represents the proportion of the population experiencing the event at baseline and is known or can be estimated (Lash et al., 2021).\nThe event counts in the treatment and comparison groups follow a Poisson distribution (Fleiss, Levin, & Paik, 2003).\nThe sample sizes of the treatment and comparison groups are known.\n\n\n\n3.5.1.2 Step 1: Obtain the standard error of the ratio of rate ratios\nThe function first obtains the standard error of the ratio of rate ratios either directly from the provided ratio_rate_ratio_se argument or by calculating it from the confidence interval using the following formula (Altman & Bland, 2011):\n\\[\nSE_{RRR} = \\frac{RRR_{upper} - RRR_{lower}}{2 \\times 1.96}\n\\]\n\nse_ratio_rate_ratio &lt;- (ratio_rate_ratio_ci_upper - ratio_rate_ratio_ci_lower) / (2 * 1.96)\n\nwhere \\(SE_{RRR}\\) is the standard error of the ratio of rate ratios, \\(RRR_{upper}\\) and \\(RRR_{lower}\\) are the upper and lower bounds of the ratio of rate ratios confidence interval, respectively.\n\n\n3.5.1.3 Step 2: Estimate the event counts\nThe event count for the comparison group is estimated using the population baseline rate and the comparison group sample size:\n\\[\nE_C = n_C \\times BR\n\\]\nwhere \\(E_C\\) is the event count for the comparison group, \\(n_C\\) is the comparison group sample size, and \\(BR\\) is the population baseline rate.\n\ncomparison_event_count &lt;- comparison_n * population_baseline_rate\n\nThe event count for the treatment group is then estimated using the ratio of rate ratios and the comparison event count:\n\\[\nE_T = E_C \\times RRR\n\\]\nwhere \\(E_T\\) is the event count for the treatment group, and \\(RRR\\) is the ratio of rate ratios.\n\ntreatment_event_count &lt;- comparison_event_count * ratio_rate_ratio\n\n\n\n3.5.1.4 Step 3: Calculate the pooled event rate and standard deviation\nThe pooled event count is calculated as the average of the treatment and comparison event counts:\n\\[\nE_P = \\frac{E_T + E_C}{2}\n\\]\nwhere \\(E_P\\) is the pooled event count.\n\npooled_event_count &lt;- (treatment_event_count + comparison_event_count) / 2\n\nThe pooled event rate is then estimated by dividing the pooled event count by the average of the treatment and comparison sample sizes:\n\\[\nR_P = \\frac{E_P}{\\frac{n_T + n_C}{2}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(R_P\\) is the pooled event rate, and \\(n_T\\) and \\(n_C\\) are the treatment and comparison group sample sizes, respectively.\n\npooled_event_rate &lt;- pooled_event_count / ((treatment_n + comparison_n) / 2)\n\nThe pooled standard deviation is estimated using the pooled event rate, assuming a Poisson distribution (Fleiss et al., 2003):\n\\[\nSD_P = \\sqrt{R_P \\times (1 - R_P)}\n\\]\nwhere \\(SD_P\\) is the pooled standard deviation.\n\npooled_sd &lt;- sqrt(pooled_event_rate * (1 - pooled_event_rate))\n\n\n\n3.5.1.5 Step 4: Calculate Cohen’s d\nCohen’s d is calculated using the estimated event rates for the treatment and comparison groups and the pooled standard deviation (Cohen, 1988):\n\\[\nd = \\frac{\\frac{E_T}{n_T} - \\frac{E_C}{n_C}}{SD_P}\n\\]\nwhere \\(d\\) is Cohen’s d.\n\ncohens_d &lt;- (treatment_event_count / treatment_n - comparison_event_count / comparison_n) / pooled_sd\n\n\n\n3.5.1.6 Step 5: Calculate the standard error and confidence interval for Cohen’s d\nThe standard error for Cohen’s d is estimated using the event rates and sample sizes:\n\\[\nSE_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{E_T}{n_T^2} + \\frac{E_C}{n_C^2}} \\times \\frac{1}{SD_P}\n\\]\nwhere \\(SE_d\\) is the standard error for Cohen’s d, \\(E_T\\) and \\(E_C\\) are the event counts in the treatment and comparison groups, respectively, \\(n_T\\) and \\(n_C\\) are the sample sizes of the treatment and comparison groups, respectively, and \\(SD_P\\) is the pooled standard deviation.\n\nstandard_error_d &lt;- sqrt((treatment_event_count / treatment_n^2) + (comparison_event_count / comparison_n^2)) / pooled_sd\n\nThe confidence interval for Cohen’s d is then calculated using the standard error (Nakagawa & Cuthill, 2007):\n\\[\nCI_d = [d - 1.96 \\times SE_d, d + 1.96 \\times SE_d]\n\\]\nwhere \\(CI_d\\) is the confidence interval for Cohen’s d.\n\ncohens_d_ci_lower &lt;- cohens_d - (1.96 * standard_error_d)\ncohens_d_ci_upper &lt;- cohens_d + (1.96 * standard_error_d)\n\n\n\n3.5.1.7 Step 6: Calculate Hedges’ g (optional)\nIf the esc_type argument is set to ‘g’, the function also calculates Hedges’ g, which applies Hedges’ correction to an estimate of the standardised mean difference (Hedges, 1981):\n\\[\ng = d \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{3}{4 \\times (n_T + n_C) - 9}\\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(g\\) is Hedges’ g.\n\nhedges_g &lt;- cohens_d * (1 - (3 / (4 * (treatment_n + comparison_n) - 9)))\n\nThe confidence interval for Hedges’ g is calculated using the same standard error as Cohen’s d.\n\n\n\n3.5.2 Estimating Cohen’s d or Hedges’ g from a Mean Difference\nThe esc_mean_difference function estimates Cohen’s d or Hedges’ g effect sizes from a reported mean difference, its standard error or confidence interval, and the sample sizes of the treatment and comparison groups. The function calculates the pooled standard deviation, effect size, standard error, confidence interval, and p-value.\n\n3.5.2.1 Assumptions\n\nThe mean difference between the treatment and comparison groups is provided.\nThe standard error of the mean difference is either provided or can be calculated from the confidence interval assuming a normal distribution (Altman & Bland, 2011).\nThe sample sizes of the treatment and comparison groups are known.\nThe variance of the outcome is assumed to be equal in both groups.\n\n\n\n3.5.2.2 Step 1: Obtain the standard error of the mean difference\nThe function first obtains the standard error of the mean difference either directly from the provided mean_diff_se argument or by calculating it from the confidence interval using the following formula (Altman & Bland, 2011):\n\\[\nSE_{MD} = \\frac{MD_{upper} - MD_{lower}}{2 \\times 1.96}\n\\]\n\nstandard_error &lt;- (mean_diff_ci_upper - mean_diff_ci_lower) / (2 * 1.96)\n\nwhere \\(SE_{MD}\\) is the standard error of the mean difference, \\(MD_{upper}\\) and \\(MD_{lower}\\) are the upper and lower bounds of the mean difference confidence interval, respectively.\n\n\n3.5.2.3 Step 2: Estimate the pooled standard deviation\nThe pooled standard deviation is estimated using the standard error and the sample sizes of the treatment and comparison groups:\n\\[\nSD_{pooled} = \\frac{SE_{MD}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_T} + \\frac{1}{n_C}}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(SD_{pooled}\\) is the pooled standard deviation, \\(SE_{MD}\\) is the standard error of the mean difference, and \\(n_T\\) and \\(n_C\\) are the sample sizes of the treatment and comparison groups, respectively.\n\nstandard_deviation_pooled &lt;- standard_error / sqrt((1 / treatment_n) + (1 / comparison_n))\n\n\n\n3.5.2.4 Step 3: Calculate Cohen’s d\nCohen’s d is calculated by dividing the mean difference by the pooled standard deviation (Cohen, 1988):\n\\[\nd = \\frac{MD}{SD_{pooled}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(d\\) is Cohen’s d, \\(MD\\) is the mean difference, and \\(SD_{pooled}\\) is the pooled standard deviation.\n\ncohens_d &lt;- mean_difference / standard_deviation_pooled\n\n\n\n3.5.2.5 Step 4: Calculate the standard error and confidence interval for Cohen’s d\nThe standard error for Cohen’s d is calculated by dividing the standard error of the mean difference by the pooled standard deviation:\n\\[\nSE_d = \\frac{SE_{MD}}{SD_{pooled}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(SE_d\\) is the standard error for Cohen’s d.\n\nstandard_error_d &lt;- standard_error / standard_deviation_pooled\n\nThe confidence interval for Cohen’s d is then calculated using the standard error (Nakagawa & Cuthill, 2007):\n\\[\nCI_d = [d - 1.96 \\times SE_d, d + 1.96 \\times SE_d]\n\\]\nwhere \\(CI_d\\) is the confidence interval for Cohen’s d.\n\nmean_diff_ci_lower_d &lt;- cohens_d - (1.96 * standard_error_d)\nmean_diff_ci_upper_d &lt;- cohens_d + (1.96 * standard_error_d)\n\n\n\n3.5.2.6 Step 5: Calculate the p-value\nThe t-statistic is calculated by dividing the mean difference by its standard error:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{MD}{SE_{MD}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(t\\) is the t-statistic.\n\nt_stat &lt;- mean_difference / standard_error\n\nThe degrees of freedom are calculated as the sum of the sample sizes minus 2:\n\\[\ndf = n_T + n_C - 2\n\\]\nwhere \\(df\\) is the degrees of freedom.\n\ndf &lt;- treatment_n + comparison_n - 2\n\nThe p-value is then calculated using the t-distribution with the calculated degrees of freedom:\n\np_value &lt;- 2 * (1 - pt(abs(t_stat), df))\n\n\n\n3.5.2.7 Step 6: Calculate Hedges’ g (optional)\nIf the esc_type argument is set to ‘g’, the function also calculates Hedges’ g, which is an unbiased estimate of the standardised mean difference (Hedges, 1981):\n\\[\ng = d \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{3}{4 \\times (n_T + n_C) - 9}\\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(g\\) is Hedges’ g.\n\nhedges_g &lt;- cohens_d * (1 - (3 / (4 * (treatment_n + comparison_n) - 9)))\n\nThe confidence interval for Hedges’ g is calculated using the same standard error as Cohen’s d.\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Estimating Cohen’s d or Hedges’ g from a Ratio of Odds Ratios\nThe esc_ratio_odds_ratio function estimates Cohen’s d or Hedges’ g effect sizes from a reported ratio of odds ratios, its standard error or confidence interval, sample sizes, and the population baseline rate. The method relies on several assumptions and approximations to convert the ratio of odds ratios to a standardised mean difference.\n\n3.5.3.1 Assumptions\n\nThe ratio of odds ratios is a measure of the relative difference in odds between the treatment and comparison groups, with the comparison group as the reference (Szumilas, 2010).\nThe standard error of the ratio of odds ratios is either provided or can be calculated from the confidence interval assuming a normal distribution of the log ratio of odds ratios (Altman & Bland, 2011).\nThe population baseline rate represents the proportion of the population experiencing the event at baseline and is known or can be estimated (Lash et al., 2021).\nThe event counts in the treatment and comparison groups follow a binomial distribution (Fleiss et al., 2003).\nThe sample sizes of the treatment and comparison groups are known.\n\n\n\n3.5.3.2 Step 1: Obtain the standard error of the log ratio of odds ratios\nThe function first obtains the standard error of the log ratio of odds ratios either directly from the provided ratio_odds_ratio_se argument or by calculating it from the confidence interval using the following formula (Altman & Bland, 2011):\n\\[\nSE_{log(ROR)} = \\frac{log(ROR_{upper}) - log(ROR_{lower})}{2 \\times 1.96}\n\\]\n\nse_log_ratio_odds_ratio &lt;- (log_ratio_odds_ratio_ci_upper - log_ratio_odds_ratio_ci_lower) / (2 * 1.96)\n\nwhere \\(SE_{log(ROR)}\\) is the standard error of the log ratio of odds ratios, \\(ROR_{upper}\\) and \\(ROR_{lower}\\) are the upper and lower bounds of the ratio of odds ratios confidence interval, respectively.\n\n\n3.5.3.3 Step 2: Convert the ratio of odds ratios to the log scale\nThe ratio of odds ratios is converted to the log scale:\n\\[\nlog(ROR) = log(ROR)\n\\]\n\nlog_ratio_odds_ratio &lt;- log(ratio_odds_ratio)\n\nwhere \\(log(ROR)\\) is the log ratio of odds ratios.\n\n\n3.5.3.4 Step 3: Estimate the event probabilities and odds\nThe event probability in the comparison group is estimated using the population baseline rate:\n\\[\nP_C = BR\n\\]\nwhere \\(P_C\\) is the event probability in the comparison group, and \\(BR\\) is the population baseline rate.\n\ncomparison_event_prob &lt;- population_baseline_rate\n\nThe odds in the comparison group are estimated using the event probability:\n\\[\nO_C = \\frac{P_C}{1 - P_C}\n\\]\nwhere \\(O_C\\) is the odds in the comparison group.\n\ncomparison_odds &lt;- comparison_event_prob / (1 - comparison_event_prob)\n\nThe odds in the treatment group are estimated using the ratio of odds ratios and the comparison odds:\n\\[\nO_T = O_C \\times ROR\n\\]\nwhere \\(O_T\\) is the odds in the treatment group, and \\(ROR\\) is the ratio of odds ratios.\n\ntreatment_odds &lt;- comparison_odds * ratio_odds_ratio\n\nThe event probability in the treatment group is estimated using the treatment odds:\n\\[\nP_T = \\frac{O_T}{1 + O_T}\n\\]\nwhere \\(P_T\\) is the event probability in the treatment group.\n\ntreatment_event_prob &lt;- treatment_odds / (1 + treatment_odds)\n\n\n\n3.5.3.5 Step 4: Convert event probabilities to approximate event counts\nThe event probabilities are converted to approximate event counts using the sample sizes:\n\\[\nE_T = n_T \\times P_T \\\\\nE_C = n_C \\times P_C\n\\]\nwhere \\(E_T\\) and \\(E_C\\) are the event counts in the treatment and comparison groups, respectively, and \\(n_T\\) and \\(n_C\\) are the sample sizes of the treatment and comparison groups, respectively.\n\ntreatment_event_count &lt;- treatment_n * treatment_event_prob\ncomparison_event_count &lt;- comparison_n * comparison_event_prob\n\n\n\n3.5.3.6 Step 5: Calculate the pooled event rate and standard deviation\nThe pooled event count is calculated as the average of the treatment and comparison event counts:\n\\[\nE_P = \\frac{E_T + E_C}{2}\n\\]\nwhere \\(E_P\\) is the pooled event count.\n\npooled_event_count &lt;- (treatment_event_count + comparison_event_count) / 2\n\nThe pooled event rate is then estimated by dividing the pooled event count by the average of the treatment and comparison sample sizes:\n\\[\nR_P = \\frac{E_P}{\\frac{n_T + n_C}{2}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(R_P\\) is the pooled event rate.\n\npooled_event_rate &lt;- pooled_event_count / ((treatment_n + comparison_n) / 2)\n\nThe pooled

standard deviation.\n\npooled_sd &lt;- sqrt(pooled_event_rate * (1 - pooled_event_rate))\n\n\n\n3.5.3.7 Step 6: Calculate Cohen’s d\nCohen’s d is calculated using the estimated event probabilities for

    "text": "3.6 Defining Housing First components\nComponents of interventions were classified based up on the definitions in Table 5.\n\n\n\nTable 5: Definitions of Housing First components for youth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing-related components\n\n\n\n\nSecure access to housing\n\n\nThe intervention seeks to place youth in safe, secure and permanent housing as quickly as possible (Baxter, Tweed, Katikireddi, & Thomson, 2019). For young people, this means a specific focus on placing them in safe, affordable and appropriate housing, that takes into account their age, developmental stage, needs and abilities (Gaetz, 2017). There is no specific timeframe within which young people must be housed, as this is dependent on local factors (e.g., housing availability and/or affordability).\n\n\n\n\nSupport to maintain tenancy\n\n\nTo support maintenance of tenancy, there is a specific focus on supporting young people to develop necessary life skills (i.e., paying rent, maintaining relationships with landlords and/or neighbours, etc.) (Gaetz, 2014). Additionally, young people are provided with assistance to set up their accommodation with furnishings and supplies.\n\n\n\n\nClients are re-housed\n\n\nIf this tenancy is unable to be maintained, young people are assisted to locate alternative housing (Dodd, Rodrigues, Sequeira, & Watkins, 2022; Roggenbuck, 2022).\n\n\n\n\nConditionality of access to housing\n\n\nClients are not required to meet any conditions in order to be, or to remain, housed. For example, there is no requirement for clients to demonstrate ‘housing readiness’, for example by having independent living skills to sustain their tenancy, or abstinence from drugs and alcohol. Clients are not required to participate in support services to maintain their tenancy, nor is service provision impacted if tenancy is lost (Baxter et al., 2019; Dodd et al., 2022; Roggenbuck, 2022; Weightman et al., 2023; Woodhall-Melnik & Dunn, 2016).\n\n\n\n\nRelationship between housing and other supports\n\n\nProvision of housing and other supports are functionally separate although they work closely together. This is designed to ensure that housing and support services are not contingent on one another. Housing support includes the provision of adequate, affordable and suitable housing. Clinical supports are provided to assist clients with physical health, mental health and social care. Complementary supports help clients improve their quality of life, integrate into the community, and potentially achieve self-sufficiency. Clinical and complementary supports are committed to providing continuity of support even if tenants are rehoused; off-site services are accessible to tenants (Baxter et al., 2019; Dodd et al., 2022; Weightman et al., 2023; Woodhall-Melnik & Dunn, 2016).\n\n\n\n\nVaried housing options are available\n\n\nFour types of housing are identifiable across Housing First models. Scattered site housing involves clients living independently in self-contained housing in the community with support services provided off-site. Transitional (also called congregate) housing involves living in a dwelling that is part of a larger complex that has common spaces and facilities. Support services are managed separately but are often available on site. Permanent supportive housing closely integrates housing and support services for clients with high support needs. Crisis (also called respite or short-stay) housing might be provided in order to divert young people away from emergency shelters while long-term housing is being arranged (Gaetz, 2014, 2017).\n\n\n\n\nClients are matched to housing based on their preferences\n\n\nClients are matched to housing places based on their needs and preferences (i.e., housing type, location, household, support needs, etc.) and environmental factors (e.g., who to allocate housing to, their level of support needs, and issues arising from social mix, etc.) (Dodd et al., 2022; Roggenbuck, 2022).\n\n\n\n\nSupport services components\n\n\n\n\nSupport to re-engage in services\n\n\nIf clients disengage from support services, they are supported to re-engage later without needing to undergo new assessment/intake processes (Dodd et al., 2022).\n\n\n\n\nYoung people are supported to reunify with their families\n\n\nThere is an emphasis on family re-unification (for clients aged under 18 years) or in re-establishing connections to family (Gaetz, 2014, 2017).\n\n\n\n\nUses a recovery focused approach\n\n\nUses a recovery focused approach that focuses on “positive youth development and wellness orientation”, specifically this involves: identifying personal strengths to build self-esteem and a positive sense of self; improving communication and problem-solving skills and assisting in personal goal setting; enhancing and building natural supports, including family relationships; and accessing educational opportunities and identify personal interests (Gaetz, 2014, 2017; Gaetz, Redman, MacKenzie, & Hand, 2021; Kozloff, Adair, et al., 2016).\n\n\n\n\nSupport services encourage social and community integration\n\n\nProvides age and developmentally appropriate support services that assist clients to work towards recovery and reintegration into the community including a specific focus on reengaging in education and employment. Mentoring and support is provided to develop life skills and social capital. Advocacy should be provided to help young people navigate bureaucracy and access additional support (Gaetz, 2014, 2017).\n\n\n\n\nServices are provided at suitable intensity\n\n\nSupport is typically provided at a high intensity but is flexible, dependant on individual needs. What constitutes high intensity support is not explicitly defined, however it is expected to vary according to the level of complexity of the individual’s case. Weekly contact between a client and case manager is recommended for youth (Gaetz, 2017).\n\n\n\n\nType of case management engagement\n\n\nUses one of two case management approaches, the selection of which is typically influenced by client needs. Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) uses a multidisciplinary team or network to support participants within a service. ACT is typically used with clients with high needs. Intensive Case Management (ICM) involves a case manager providing a high level of support to the client to access other services and/or resolve issues of relevance. ICM is often used with clients with high acuity mental illness (Weightman et al., 2023; Woodhall-Melnik & Dunn, 2016).\n\n\n\n\nComponents applicable to both housing and support services\n\n\n\n\nInvolvement of youth in consumer choice and self-determination\n\n\nClients have a high degree of control over the housing and support services they receive. They can select where they want to live, who they want to live with and the type of housing in which they live. Support services are individualised to client needs and participation is voluntary (Baxter et al., 2019; Roggenbuck, 2022; Weightman et al., 2023; Woodhall-Melnik & Dunn, 2016). For young people this is captured by the phrase “youth choice, youth voice, and self-determination” which reflects the importance of supporting youth to make informed choices, taking into account their developmental stage, age and cognitive functioning (Gaetz, 2017; Gaetz et al., 2023, 2021).. People are able to make real choices about how they live their lives, and these choices determine the support they receive including how, where, when and by whom it is provided.\n\n\n\n\nAccess to housing or services is ongoing for as long as required\n\n\nHousing and support services are provided on an ongoing basis i.e., they are not limited to a specific length of time (Goering et al., 2011). This is to ensure that young people have sufficient time to develop the skills, confidence and the financial stability necessary to live independently (Gaetz, 2014).\n\n\n\n\nCase managers have sufficient time to devote to clients\n\n\nThe intervention recognises that the relationship between the client and case manager is important and frequent and timely contact is provided (Roggenbuck, 2022; Woodhall-Melnik & Dunn, 2016). Case managers have sufficient time to provide support to clients at the required intensity (Weightman et al., 2023). Recommended caseloads are for between 7-10 clients per case manager (Gaetz et al., 2023)."

Nelson et al., 2014) .\nTight timelines impacted ability to engage staff with lived experience in the development of the intervention, and led to issues such as mistrust and poor communication between sites and head office (Nelson et al., 2013).\n\n\nSome sites faced challenges in completing proposals due to a lack of a local housing and homelessness services infrastructure, leadership, service capacity, or human resources (Nelson et al., 2013).\nSites who were otherwise well equipped felt they had insufficient time to consult with the existing service providers during the proposal phase (Nelson et al., 2013).\n\n\n\n\nFacilitators\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\nThe strength of existing services in the community was a key factor in the project’s success (Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014).\n\n\nEffective leaders and strong staff teams with the right combination of technical and interpersonal skills, including decision-making abilities, clear direction, fostering a shared learning, and extensive experience working with various consumer populations, were crucial for success (Macnaughton et al., 2015; Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014).\nTimelines and expectation promoted teamwork and productivity the during planning stages (Nelson et al., 2013).\nSite-specific programs addressing the needs of CALD and Indigenous communities facilitated engagement and success (Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014).\nFlexibility for sites to develop unique interventions or third arms was valuable in adjusting to individual needs (Nelson et al., 2013).\nAt the national level, Site Coordinators with a strong understanding of the project-wide logic model and the ability to move their site towards implementation of that model were critical to success (Nelson et al., 2013, 2012).\nA site operations team, local advisory committee and various work groups facilitated good organisational structure and governance (Nelson et al., 2012).\n\n\nStakeholders deemed the program a valuable opportunity with potential for transformative change, and the initial excitement and enthusiasm were beneficial for moving the project forward (Nelson et al., 2013).\nThe community valued collaboration and collective effort which aligned with the project (Nelson et al., 2012).\nRecruiting consumers in a manner that allowed them to maintain existing service relationships with established community service providers was important (Nelson et al., 2012) .\nCollaboration between project programs and the major shelters facilitated recruitment of participants (Nelson et al., 2012).\n\n\n\n\nImplementation\n\n\n\n\nBarriers\n\n\nThe lack of established program protocols prior to implementation made it difficult to manage the intake of new consumers while simultaneously finding housing for participants, supporting existing consumers and helping them maintain housing (Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014).\nBottlenecks in the referral process from screening to referral slowed down access to housing (Macnaughton et al., 2012).\nACT and ICM teams needed closer relationships with housing team to better identify and engage yet-to-be housed individuals (Macnaughton et al., 2012).\nThe lack of a clear governance model sometimes led to delays in obtaining housing for consumers and a lack of cohesion and contact among clinical housing teams (Nelson et al., 2014).\nThe project design made transferring participants between service teams and housing types very difficult, even when a different model would better suit clients’ needs (Nelson et al., 2012).\nA small sub-group of participants with severe substance use problems experienced continued housing instability (Macnaughton et al., 2015).\nIn small communities, privacy was a concern when certain information about the project or consumers was shared. For example, landlords would sometimes share information about difficult consumers within their network, making it more challenging to secure housing for those individuals (Nelson et al., 2012).\nSome landlords exhibited stigma and racism, particularly towards Aboriginal people with mental health issues or substance use disorders, which led to them avoiding housing these individuals (Macnaughton et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014)\nProgram staff had to work hard to sustain/repair relationships with landlords, as they were unable to fulfill all the guarantees that initially attracted them to the program, such as consistent visits with the participants or prompt repairs to damaged property (Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014).\nConsumers expressed frustration with some staff practices, including dissatisfaction with home visits due to variety of people dropping in, the volume and repetitiveness of questions asked, and viewed home visits as unnecessary (Nelson et al., 2012).\nThere was a lack of after-hours staff support to assist with crisis situations and issues with landlords (Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014).\n\n\nHousing availability was limited due to a lack of affordability and the reluctance of some housing agencies to risk established relationships with landlords by housing higher-risk Housing First clients (Macnaughton et al., 2012, 2015; Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014)\n\n\nThere was insufficient planning and discussion on how to assist people not doing well in the program due to the diversity of consumer needs and functioning (Nelson et al., 2014).\nVarying support needs meant that vocational specialists’ work was often dominated crisis management for a significant minority of unstable clients, rather than focusing on proactive, long-term goal planning with participants ready to move further in their recovery (Macnaughton et al., 2015).\nACT and ICM teams struggled to reconcile a recovery approach with heavy workload demands (Nelson et al., 2012).\nThe high consumers to staff ratio resulted in reduced one-to-one attention for participants, the impact of travel time between staff offices and participants’ homes was a particular burden for service teams (Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014).\nBusy team members found it difficult to find time to participate in training and improve their practice approaches without further increasing workload and stress (Nelson et al., 2012).\nService providers’ irregular work hours and lack of opportunities for debriefing concerns were challenging (Nelson et al., 2012).\n\n\nLack of public transport was a barrier for consumers to get to appointments to receive health and social services, visit food bank, maintain relationships with family and friends (Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014).\nBetter collaboration and communication with local health care providers in the community were needed to address challenged in partnerships with community agencies (Nelson et al., 2012).\nImportant service programs, such as addiction treatment, vocational and educational support, were lacking in the community (Nelson et al., 2014).\nCOVID pandemic restrictions impacted the ability to have face to face meetings with mentors (Thulien et al., 2022, 2019).\n\n\nThere was a lack of training and difficulty meeting the cultural and linguistic requirements of diverse populations (Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014).\nLimited opportunities for informal communication between teams, housing and support services being at different sites, and tensions between support teams due to competition for housing and perceived comparisons of project outcomes hindered collaboration and cohesion (Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014).\nHigh staff turnover was experienced, possibly driven by weak leadership and poor team dynamics (Macnaughton et al., 2015).\nPeer specialists were not seen as equal team members and were not meaningfully integrated, with a general lack of communication about their role. One site noted the importance of supporting peers to adopt a full-service role through proper training and workplace support, especially given their susceptibility to re-traumatisation during work (Macnaughton et al., 2015; Nelson et al., 2012)\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\nFacilitators\n\n\nCollaborating with landlords, landlord associations and property management companies was beneficial for implementation. These partnerships: a) made landlords more likely to consult with service team members to resolve issues rather than notifying police or initiating eviction proceedings, and b) led to successful, high quality housing procurement (Macnaughton et al., 2015; Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014).\nProviding consistent support to landlords, including prompt responses to problematic tenancy issues, paying for any damage, and guaranteeing rent payment, were strong incentives for landlord participation (Macnaughton et al., 2015).\n\n\nPartnerships with government agencies and departments enhanced the project’s ability to secure consumer access to housing units, mental health and homelessness services, and government income supports (Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014).\nRent subsidies, housing team procurement strategies and a community of relationships were crucial in both expanding potential housing supply and achieving quicker access to housing (Macnaughton et al., 2012).\n\n\nNA\n\n\nAcross sites, participants highlighted the importance of having a diverse group of partners in providing a comprehensive continuum of care to participants (Nelson et al., 2012).\nPartnerships with consumers enabled peer-driven initiatives like social gatherings, peer support programs for individuals with substance use issues, participant-produced newsletters, and participant-led focus groups on eviction prevention. Consumers could help fellow consumers and offer staff insider information about community resources (Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014).\n\n\nImplementation support from project’s national implementation team was beneficial (Macnaughton et al., 2015).\nStaff members with lived experience were able to build trust, relate and empathise with participants (Nelson et al., 2012).\nOrganisational structure and governance were critical in defining roles, responsibilities, facilitating collaboration, partnership building, effective communication and conflict resolution (Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014).\nA good organisational culture facilitated team dynamics – where the values were consistent with Housing First principles and common attitude to do whatever it takes to help participants achieve their goals, teams worked better together and had higher fidelity (Macnaughton et al., 2015).\nTeam diversity, fostering cross-team learning and sharing, breaking down hierarchies, along with team cohesion through structured meetings, formal training, all-team events and shared office space, nurtured teamwork and supported service delivery that leveraged expertise across areas (Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014).\nStaff stability allowed service providers to integrate new approaches, practices and tools effectively (Nelson et al., 2012).\nIncorporating additional expertise into the team, such as a psychiatrist to support clients with complex needs, or a home economist to help participants develop tenancy skills, was beneficial (Macnaughton et al., 2015).\n\n\nParticipants stated that local partners, including business owners, police, hospital staff, community mental health teams, shelters, meal providers, churches, the United Way, and mobile crisis teams, were crucial in contributing expertise and experience. This increased the project’s ability to integrate into the community’s network of supports and services (Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014).\nThe small size of the community facilitated easier contact and collaboration with existing community service providers, enabling efficient information transfer among professionals, the public and potential participants (Nelson et al., 2012).\nTraining and technical assistance provided by the Mental Health Commission of Canada were responsive, fair, generous and supportive. Positive and productive communication, funding, practical guidance and training opportunities were beneficial (Nelson et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2014).\n\n\n\n\nSustainment\n\n\n\n\nBarriers\n\n\nThe project’s short timeline made landlords more reluctant to sign year-long lease agreements as the project neared its end (Macnaughton et al., 2015)\n\n\n—\n\n\nProgram costs were identified as a barrier to program sustainability (Nelson et al., 2012)\n\n\n—\n\n\nStaff expressed significant concerns about the lack of information regarding project sustainability. They felt a critical need for knowledge dissemination about the steps being taken to ensure that consumers were not abandoned once the research project ended (Nelson et al., 2013, 2012).\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\nFacilitators\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\nForming and maintaining good community partnerships with various stakeholders and existing agencies with various social service systems, (e.g., justice system personnel, employment/income assistance agencies, and wider mental health and substance use systems).
